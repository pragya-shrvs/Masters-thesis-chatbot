monkey-flunki-punki .
i want it here , in my hand .
stanzi-manzi , i 'll put it in your hand !
who was that ?
no one .
wolfi , who gave you this ?
i 'm not telling you .
why not ?
no . do n't answer it !
are n't i ?
and he 's working on it very hard .
give me one reason i can understand .
i ca n't write it !
why not ?
go back to bed .
excellency !
frau mozart ?
but why did he not come himself ?
he 's terribly busy , sir .
really ?
then he did n't send you ?
no , sir . this is my own idea .
i see .
thank you very much , your excellency .
you see , they 're all originals .
originals ?
these are originals ?
it is miraculous .
one word from me and the post is his .
come back tonight .
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
but ! i 'm a married woman !
where shall we go ?
what ?
what are you doing here ?
he took sick . i brought him home .
why you ?
i was at hand .
you can go now .
he needs me , ma'am .
just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
this is not his handwriting .
i was assisting him . he asked me .
respect my wish and go .
how much will you pay him ?
am i interrupting something ?
not at all .
where 's our friend ?
he said to tell you .
do you know how many people are waiting ?
leave him alone !
do you realize that ?
he 's doing his best .
it 's ridiculous !
and what 's so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
money ! money !
you 're mad ! she 's mad , wolfi .
i see that you 're expecting .
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
people send us gifts all the time .
it 's unheard of !
the only time you come out is to eat .
oh , now i 'm a bad housekeeper !
the place is a pigsty all the time .
be careful !
he 's adorable !
behold !
hey !
behold !
we 're with the emperor .
it is not permitted .
i can not let anyone pass .
upstairs .
gertrude !
i thought you must be an old man .
and for gertrude .
if you think she stinks , say so .
i said play !
what a strange young man .
really ?
just one year .
who was your teacher ?
what a charming idea . may i see ?
it 's just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
you do me too much honour , sire .
a-flat , majesty .
my pleasure .
being a foreigner , i would love to learn .
this is my niece , the princess elizabeth .
an interesting idea , majesty . but -
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
ah-ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart .
a very clever idea .
sire .
it is rather alarming .
yes ?
your own law decrees it , i 'm afraid .
your majesty !
oh , thank you .
the director of our opera . count orsini-rosenberg .
herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you .
why so ?
tell us the story .
yes , where ?
a seraglio .
it is already here in my head .
what ? on one hearing only ?
yes , indeed .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
you really like it , your majesty ?
cut a few and it will be perfect .
she is my landlady .
excuse me , but how old are you ?
most charming . yes , indeed . clever man .
what is it ?
is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
is it true ?
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
i hate politics .
it 's a piece about love .
ah , love again .
how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
well , six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
but i assure you , my music is not .
but you do not persuade .
yes , sir .
well , what do you have for me today ?
your majesty , herr mozart -
yes , what about him ?
he 's here .
why are you here ?
am i not welcome ?
just wait , you 'll see .
is she not here ?
do you always live like this ?
it 's not so easy cleaning up after me .
she wants to do everything herself .
how is your financial situation ?
it could n't be better .
that 's not what i hear .
people love me here .
they say you 're in debt .
now that 's a malicious lie !
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i 've got to have time for composition .
composition does n't pay . you know that .
what 's that ?
oh , let 's not talk about it .
why not ?
it 's a secret .
you do n't have secrets from me .
is n't that marvelous ? we 're delighted .
why did n't you mention it in your letters ?
do n't spend any money on me .
no , really !
please play without me .
papa , is this your idea ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
i 'm leaving !
no one calls you that .
father -
here she comes . fraulein lorl , good morning .
good morning , sir .
give my best thanks to the baker .
are you well today , fraulein lorl ?
yes , thank you , sir .
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
oh , thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i 've seen .
does he work at all ?
he does n't even eat .
really ? what is it he 's writing ?
oh , i would n't know that , sir .
where does he work ?
calm . what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm scared !
why ? what has happened ?
what medicine ?
i do n't know . he has pains .
where ?
they bend him right over .
is he working ?
and his father 's dead .
is he working ?
opera ? opera !
i 'm very , very frightened .
yes ?
are you herr mozart ?
that 's right .
sssh !
stanzi-manzi-banzi-wanzi !
well ?
sublime ! utterly sublime !
he liked the monkey , did n't you ?
yes , well , it 's all good fun .
you could do something marvelous for them .
you 'd have to use those .
german !
what else do you think they speak here ?
i have n't done anything in german since seraglio .
leave that alone !
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
it 's nothing for you .
is it finished ?
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what 'd you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
well , we can .
she 's my wife .
madame .
i 'm afraid i am .
good morning , fraulein schlumberg .
are n't i right , herr mozart ?
it 's a miracle , herr mozart !
what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm sorry . no .
please , sir .
really ?
mio caro adone .
love , sire !
er , on the whole , yes , majesty .
dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .
did you like it , then ?
so you are . how is your pretty wife ?
you are the first to know .
today , i ca n't .
is n't that what you wanted ?
the post has been filled .
whom did they choose ?
herr sommer .
he could actually do musical harm to the princess !
we have no footman . nothing at all !
i hear they are quite successful .
i 'm not a fiend !
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
ah , how exciting ! tell me more .
it 's a bit of a secret .
truly .
crema al mascarpone .
ah . italian ?
fifty ?
what exactly are you working on ?
what 's the matter ?
pages of it .
really ? why ?
ca n't you talk to him ?
he 's obviously no friend of yours .
you burned the score ?
my wife took it out in time .
oh , excellency , would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
that 's all it 's had - and withdrawn .
but what is it they do n't like ?
did you like it at all ?
i think it 's marvelous . truly .
perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .
it would be a tremendous honour for me .
oh no , the honour would be all mine .
grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !
mozart . it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not , excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
who are you ?
do you accept ? you will be paid well .
how long will you give me ?
i 'm sorry , but i need more time .
are you neglecting my request ?
what happened ? is it over ?
you 're not well .
where is your wife ?
she went to the spa .
you mean she 's not coming back ?
truly . thank you .
no , please .
you must know that .
this is only a vaudeville .
do you mean that ?
i do .
are you ill ?
the doctor thinks i am . but -
what ?
shall i answer it ?
no ! no , it 's him !
who ?
the man . he 's here .
finish what ?
it 's impossible ! did he say a hundred ?
i 'm not allowed .
i ca n't write .
tell me , what is this work ?
flammis acribus addictis . how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?
oh , yes .
strange !
confutatis maledictis .
we ended in f major ?
yes .
the fire .
what time ?
ma-le-dic-tis . g-sharp , of course .
do you have that ?
i think so .
all right ?
the first bassoon and tenor trombone -
it could n't be simpler .
first bassoon and tenor trombone - what ?
with the tenors .
also identical ?
and that 's all ?
do you have me ?
i think so .
that 's wonderful !
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca ' ?
yes , and on 'dictis ' .
and that 's it . do you have it ?
you go fast !
do you have it ?
yes .
do you want to rest a bit ?
oh no . i 'm not tired at all .
then we 'll do the lacrimosa .
i 'm not leaving you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
you mean in turkey ?
it is what his majesty thinks that counts .
that will do , herr mozart !
right away .
this is a dance at figaro 's wedding .
what are you doing , herr director ?
what is this , herr chamberlain ?
just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl .
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
no , but i 'm the best .
a little modesty would suit you better .
of course ! always the italians !
mozart -
ba-ba ! ba-ba ! anything else is morbid .
mozart -
herr mozart -
well done , mozart . really quite fine .
mozart -
is n't that marvelous ?
surely you can choose more elevated themes ?
what do you want ?
i thought you might like to talk to someone .
about what ?
you do remember that , do n't you ?
so ?
in the sight of god that is a sin .
what do you want ?
do you understand that you have sinned ? gravely .
leave me alone .
i can not leave alone a soul in pain .
you never heard of me , did you ?
all men are equal in god 's eyes .
are they ?
i can offer you god 's forgiveness .
please talk to me .
how well are you trained in music ?
i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
what is it ?
well ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
i did n't know you wrote that .
wolfgang amadeus mozart . you know who that is ?
the man you accuse yourself of killing .
ah - you 've heard that ?
all vienna has heard that .
and do they believe it ?
is it true ?
do you believe it ?
do you hear me ?
i could n't stop them .
did you try ?
and i was nothing to god .
you can not say that !
no ? was mozart a good man ?
that is all you need to know .
go on , tell me ! speak for him !
my son , no one can speak for god .
so speak now . answer me !
what ?
do you understand ? do you ?
you did n't kill him .
i did .
no , you did n't !
i poisoned his life .
but not his body .
is that your penance ? is it ?
oh my son , my poor son !
yes ?
an italian opera .
you mean that play ?
exactly .
he 's setting that play to music ?
yes .
are you absolutely sure ?
i 've seen the manuscript .
where ?
well , mozart is already rehearsing .
incredible .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
is there a ballet in figaro ?
bravo , your majesty !
here i am , my angel .
what ? who the devil are you ?
i heard your wish .
i ca n't wait .
well , promise then .
what do you mean - now ?
it has to stop .
such a talent .
who is she ?
but she says it 's urgent .
that lady is back , sir .
what does he want ?
herr salieri .
yes , i am looking after him .
can we come in ?
well , he 's sleeping now . better not .
but he 's all right ?
of course .
bene .
i 'll call tomorrow .
that should cheer him up , eh ?
has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet ?
the american ? yes , duck .

can i be of service , miss price ?
dr. hirsch ?

yes , doctor , i have .
i 'm concerned about david .
yes , sir .
it 's a full moon . where is he ?
he 's not ?
has his friend appeared to him again ?
yes .
what did he say ?
david says jack comes to warn him .
warn him ?
is this more serious than i know ?
yes .
you 've absolutely no idea where david might be ?
surely you 're not suggesting ...
he 's here .
where was he ?
he woke up at the zoo .
the zoo ? is he rational ?
have you listened to the radio or television ?
no , why ?
is david acting strangely ?
could you get here without any trouble ?
yes , i should think so .
do you understand ?
yes , doctor .
you wo n't need any help ?
he 's fine . we 'll come right over .
shall i send a car ?
no , a cab will be faster .
what shall we do ?
david ?
it was n't a lunatic .
i beg your pardon ?
it was a wolf .
what ?
mr. kessler ?
yes ?
you have n't eaten your lunch .
i 'm not very hungry , thank you .
i 'm afraid you have to eat something .
leave the pills . i 'll take them later .
aw come on , miss price !
call me alex .
call me david .
shall i be forced to feed you , david ?
i do n't want any food .
let 's try a little harder , shall we ?
you 're a very beautiful girl .
i thought you were asleep .
do you like it ?
what do you dream about ?
i dream of death mostly .
i should n't have asked you .
how old are you ?
that 's not really a very proper question .
how old are you ?
twenty-eight .
i 'm twenty-seven .
i know .
now what do you want to talk about ?
was jack goodman your good friend ?
my best friend . my very best friend .
shall i read to you ?
you all right ?
yes , go on .
hello . you all right ?
i 'm sorry i woke you up .

alex ?
yes ?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
of course .
do you really ?
i was awake and he was in my room .
but , david .
tomorrow is the full moon .
do me an enormous favor ?
it 's silly of you to be apprehensive .
okay .
i 've left those pills for you .
there 's food in the fridge .
where on earth have you been ! ? !
but you know what ? i feel terrific !
what did i do last night , alex ?
do n't you remember ?
the next corner we can get a cab .
i should be committed .
dr. hirsch will know what to do .
but ...
david , what are you doing ?
it had to be me , alex .
jack was right . i ...
jack is dead !
let 's go to dr. hirsch .
he 's playing a stupid joke , sir .
what ?
we had an argument . he 's being silly .
his friend was killed and ...
hopeless . it 's hopeless .
i 've got to do something !
david , do n't lose control .
hello , benjamin .
no .
no what ?
no .

miss price .
yes , mrs. hobbs .
will you be sure of that ?
has he been refusing food ?
officer , i killed those people last night .
all right , you two , move along .
i want you to arrest me !
there 's no call for that kind of language .
winston churchill was full of shit !
now see here young man .
why are you doing this to me , jack ?
the undead .
did you hear the one about the crashing plane ?
i sha n't tell it .
oh , come on , tell us .
it was full of men from the united nations .
no one wanted them here !
mr. kessler ? wake up , please .
what time is it ?
alex ?
miss price , the other nurse that attended you .
do you have bad dreams , too ?
some , everyone does .
yes , but does everyone kill bambi ?
where am i ?
you 're in a hospital in london .
where 's jack ? i had a strange dream .
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
miss price ! miss price , please !
there were witnesses ?
so they said .
you 've never had bad dreams before ?
a big wolf or something . a rabid dog .
did you see jack ?
did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb ?
i 'd rather not be by myself .
are you cold ?
yes .
jack .
david .
you 're not having a good time are you ?
well , i like it here .
northern england first , italy later .
she 's a jerk .
i do n't know .
how many years of foreplay is that ?
the slaughtered lamb ?
that 's a wolf 's head .
i assume full responsibility .
okay .
hello .
nice looking group .
listen , at least it 's warm in here .
what about it ?
it 's a five-pointed star .
ask them what the candles are for .
right .
go on , ask them .
jack , we 'd better go .
!
what the hell was that all about ?
beware the moon ?
i guess leaving was the best idea .
what do you think was wrong ?
i have no idea .
did you hear that ?
i heard that .
could be a lot of things .
yeah ?
a coyote .
there are n't any coyotes in england .
the hound of the baskervilles .
pecos bill .
heathcliffe .
heathcliffe did n't howl .
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb .

it 's moving .
what 's the plan ?
plan ?
it 's in front of us .

i 'll tell you when we get there .
you really scared me , you shithead .
nice to see you .
get the fuck out of here , jack .
thanks a lot .
david ! you 're hurting my feelings .
i was surprised at how many people came .
you were a very well-liked person .
debbie klein cried a lot .
i ca n't stand it .
rudy levine the shmuck ?
i 'm going completely crazy .
david !
we were attacked by a werewolf .
what 's wrong with you ? shut up !
the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed .
it 's you , david .
what ? !
you survived and now you shall continue the curse .
get out ! god damit !
'beware the moon . '
stop it , jack .
you 've got two days .
it 's movie dialogue !
nurse !
it 's our only chance .
nurse !
suicide , david . join me .
you 're not real .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you .
yes .
get out of here , jack !
you 'll change , you 'll become ...
jack , are you really dead ?
what do you think ?
you must believe me .
bullshit !
you must take your own life !
hi , jack .
what can i say , jack ?
if i was still alive , i probably would .
you look awful .
thank you .
i do n't remember doing it .
i 'm glad to see you , jack .
david kessler , this is gerald bringsly .
hello .
because this must be stopped .
dr. hirsch ?

i do n't rightly know , sir .
i can assure you of that .

it sounds like a perfectly safe investment .
i do n't like taking mortgages from widows .
yes - sure

how much ?
about twenty-four thousand .

what good will that do ?
by making a lot of idiotic loans !
what 's wrong with that kind of banking ?
character , hmmpf ! that 's your idea ?
i knew their fathers and mothers before them .
. . as faith !
we want to talk to you .

what are you doing tonight , phyllis ?
i 've been planning it for months .

but i wo n't stand it any longer
what 's this ?

he 'd think i was unclean .
we tell the wrong person , it 's over .

the mainstream media . tv , or a newsmagazine .
have to be careful who we pick .
not even at home .
what about `` 60 minutes . ''

i 'm dying to know .

austin , may i have a word with you ?
i 'm sorry .

of course , i had my nine-millimeter automatic .
no , did you use a condom ?
only sailors use condoms , man .
alotta meant nothing to me .

out and about , doing odds and sods .
do you have a piece of gum ?
do you think she 's prettier than i ?
who ?
you know who .
does that make you horny ?
any thoughts ?
it did n't matter .
not a good time to lose one 's head .

we 're a team .
i love you .
at ease , boys .
likewise .

austin , i 'm coming with you .

dr . evil ?
you 're interrupting my moment of triumph .
what do we have ?
sea bass .

in due time .
what are you waiting for ?
close the tank .
scott , are you coming ?

virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year .
oh , hello vanessa . how was the flight ?
great .
how 's austin ?
he 's asleep .
i 'm proud of you .
why ?
it 's bizarre .
it did n't matter .
i just do n't see it .
did you ever ...
i was married to your father .
did you ever want to ?
you did n't answer my question , mum .
best to leave things alone .
i love you .
why are you here ?
well , it 's kind of weird .
what do you want to do , scott ?
we do n't label people here , scott .
no , he 's really evil .
shame . i was recommended . by a friend .
really ?
say , a tuscan hillside in june ?
normally , we 'd be eager to oblige --
seriously ?
down your phoneline . for limited periods .
how real does it feel ?
anything you like . within reason .
there are limits ?
we 'll be in touch .
do you understand ... ? blue ...
... bottle ...
red ...
knight ...
black ...
... death ...
love ...
flower ...
nature ...
... preserve ...
secret ...
... love ...
hope ...
... love ...
fear ...
... love ...
how long have i been here ?
he took a huge risk . the ultimate test .
how did you acquire a taste for it ?
you
have we met ?
ah , beautiful . just as he promised .
promised ? who promised ?
may i help you , madam ...
mr. john steed , please .
i 'm afraid that 's impossible .
you are female ?
as you see .
then you ca n't come in .
i have an appointment .
not in boodles . not since 1922 .
sir august ... ? sir august ... ?
your voice -- it 's so familiar ...
you are within an ace of winning .
this is n't a game .
quite right , but we still make the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
people , too .
then who wins ?
hmmm ...
my number two . special assignments . she 's --
how curious ...
steed here will show you the ropes .
the ministry 's worried .
i resign .
you ca n't resign .
what are you trying to do to me ?
we want to help ... !
to us all ...
top priority . government approved .
the institute ... the funding ...
who ?
where are you going ?
to find out who killed my husband .
this is a very secure establishment .
about your next assignment , mrs. peel ...
as i was saying , perhaps another macaroon ...
good luck ... peter ... emma .
fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
dr . darling , peter ... all you ...
an unholy trinity ...
you killed my husband .
too many cooks --
i planned everything , even the ministry recruiting you ...
all the clues led me here ...
of course . i planned that , too .
but -- why ?
for you . it was all for you ...
'our revels now are ended . '
think of this as your second wedding feast ...
you know , i believe she 's actually jealous .
valentine , listen to me ...
oh , yes , i know : the ring .
it 's impenetrable , by the way ...
you 're mad .
such as ?
i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air .
the result would be ...
you 've seen a few samples ...
then what 's stopping you ?
you 'll always be mrs. peel .
what are my choices ?
choices ?
doctor peel , i presume ?
i was about to throw in the towel .
i had a spot of bother at the door .
not a woman inside boodles since --
whereas you are .
rules are made to be broken .
and just what is the game ?
i did n't . mother did .
ah ... from trubshaw 's . my shoemaker .
my father always wanted a boy .
really ? i fail to see the connection .
do you ?
no point setting out half shod .
steed , we really must be --
you can but i wish you would n't ...
nobody walks around like that . milk ?
but why ? what 's the point ?
think of it as my suit of shining armor .
and i suppose you 're the knight .
and always ready to protect his queen .
as per mother 's instructions .
do we always follow mother 's instructions ?
freelance . like yourself .
more tea ?
no thanks .
now ...
and a daughter somewhere -- julie .
june , july ... august ?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .
any other vices ?
i distract him while you snoop around ? how ?
ah , brenda ... mrs. peel ?
you should be dead . how do you feel ?
strange .
not me you should thank .
i was n't about to .
i thought you were just overdressed .
they think i tried to kill you .
why should they think that ?
left you for dead .
frankly that 's how i remember it .
perhaps your memory plays tricks , mrs. peel .
did he say who ?
an invitation . to a 'formal picnic ' ... ?
international satellite systems . formerly of the ministry .
what on earth ?
is that written in his shoe ?
common knowledge , mrs. peel ...
for you , mrs. peel .
but
not quite . this is my field .
is there anything that is n't ?
a 'quick fix ' ...
filling in mother nature 's blind spots ... ?
but it proved impractical . too bulky ...
but if someone miniaturized the process ...
that 's what we were working on .
three agents killed by bad weather ...
... and by you , mrs. peel ...
a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
no sisters ? no undiscovered twin ?
not that i know of . explanation ?
do you always drive this fast ?
what , lady disdain ? are you yet breathing ?
steed ... !
where am i ?
i thought you were someone else ...
you followed me .
orders .
to kill me ?
i could save you the trouble .
no trouble .
because you always obey orders ...
yes ... ?
and do you trust me ?
that kiss ...
mmm ... what are you doing ?
keeping a stiff upper lip ?
but you did suspect me .
not for a moment .
you 're playing games .
are n't we all , mrs. peel ?
i thought you played by the rules .
i thought you did n't .
i 'm playing to win .
no , after you .
you do n't trust me ?
i told mother i took care of you .
you lied .
any idea who ?
quite . any childhood friends ? enemies ?
we 'd better be careful .
his name 's jones . 'invisible ' jones .
why 's he called 'invisible ' ?
are n't you coming ?
we must hurry , mrs. peel ...
hurry ? what for ? i 'm just now --
colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend .
what 's that you 're wearing ?
it 's called black leather .
what is it ?
you first .
trubshaw again ? what now ?
they 're playing your song , mrs. peel .
where are those bloody ministers ?
i 'll be back ...
after all , i am still the chief suspect .
i might as well .
mrs. peel ?
what kept you ?
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
' ... in a beautiful pea green boat ... '
a fine night , mrs. peel ...
still a bit chilly ...
have you any place in mind ?
it 's the latest thing , mrs. peel .
our little paradise -- just made for two ?
our chaperon .
ah ... sun tan lotion . any shops nearby ?
with a twist . you 're our chief suspect .
where 's mother ?
you do n't believe him ?
decontamination is almost complete .
decontamination -- ?
other than that i 'm perfectly normal .
i see .
peter 's brother ? but --
surveillance ? by whom ?
darling .
who 's now vanished .
makes two of us .
i was getting to it .
on the site of a former ministry installation ...
privately owned by ...
let me guess : wonderland weather .
very good , mrs. peel ...
i shall need a small plane .
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
global warming ?
that suspect was not mrs. peel .
oh , hello ...
we want mrs. peel .
steed
how did you guess ?
'find steed ... '
mother . i thought you were burglars .
think she really killed those agents ?
theory goes she may be very ill .
amnesia ?
possibly . split personality ...
insane ... ?
darling is right , you should watch out .
why ?
termination .
anyone particular in mind ?
someone tipped them off ...
it 's manmade . a kind of weather bomb .
this man -- did you see him ?
i was growing fond of mrs. peel . unfortunately --
guilty until proven innocent ?
where ?
are you alright , young man ?
i hope he was a baddy .
i feel sure of it .
mrs. peel with you ?
you with mother or father ?
both , actually .
most unfair . quite a fuss at the ministry .
wonderland weather ltd .
mrs. peel -- ?
ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
no , please ! i beg you ...
walk over to the window ...
let it be rain , please let it be --
john steed .
the last one you 'll ever see .
you 're better than i expected .
i was at harrow ...
bang-bang ... you 're dead .
one shot -- for emergencies .
that 's not playing by the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
if you say so .
you said ... one shot .
are n't you forgetting about something ?
you are , and it 's behind you .
what 's happening ?
debbie 's marrying rick .

i see you 're still in the neighborhood .
just visiting . i live in lincoln park now .
yeah ? what have you been up to ?
i work for city hall .
with grenadine , right ?
when i was twenty .
i 'm working here .
carrying swayzak 's notebook ?
how can you work for that guy ?
think about your future for once .
marty 's a good man , brian .
arson .
hey .
i could use a date .
hi .
sorry . are you dating anyone ?
you think that 's really any of your business ?
well , you did invite me here .
thanks for the invite .
what do you think ?
homey .
then why did you quit ?
brian . what 's wrong ?
it 's all over the fucking news .
all for a couple 's political points .
i was doing my job .
i saw you and your brother --
leave stephen out of this --
just another probie working for swayzak --
-- i work for the city .
hi .
hi .
look , i 'm sorry about the other day --
i want to know why he keeps that hidden .
i do n't know anything about it .
you want me to just throw that away ?
what is --
i 'm sorry .
that 's a dumb thing to say .
i quit two days ago , brian .
what 'll you do ?
i do n't have the slightest idea ...
i 'll see ya around , huh ?
lost a dad to the animal , huh ?
fair ?
who 's doing this ?

`` trychtichlorate is a binary structured -- ''

a gun 's a helluva lot easier
but the right guess on this is arson .
our killer does n't love fire !
what ?
and he made his burns backdrafts .
but he killed these guys .
that 's it . that 's the reason .
what reason ?
are you going public with this ?

i ai n't used to 'em , sir .
pooh ! pooh ! best , you are joking .
what is your uncle 's name ?
o'grady .
where 's the beauty you promised me ?
i have acted as i think fit .
sir , i 'm a british officer .
do you know the cards well ?
only a very little , as soldiers do .
what are the chevalier 's intentions ?
has he sent the challenge yet ?
and his baggage ?
have you taken my message to him ?
you are no match for best with the sword .
make best an apology , and be off .
she is now mrs. john best .
was there another mr. john best ? !
the coward !
who are you , sirrah ?
where is my rascal , lazlo ?
good gracious ! what is this ?
you are going to drive to the frontier .
but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand .
your honor must lower his voice .
all europe shall hear of this !
i have no luggage .
your name is lazlo zilagyi ?
yes , sir .
you come highly recommended by herr seebach .
herr seebach was a very kind employer .
for whom else have you worked ?
who else can give me information about you ?
it will come out well for me .
i believe they will deport you .
certain ?
then you yield to me .
that is a trifle strong .
no .
have you had one ?
never .
but , for a time ... a passing fancy ?
not one .
i could value only someone whom i loved .
your heart is empty .
you want my heart ?
it is my only object .
to make me wretched in two weeks .
then i will respectfully take leave of her .
do you not agree ?
yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived .
will we always leave it at this ?
a full diet can only kill it .

as much as possible ?
yes , for i wish to entertain splendidly .

what about pike ?
he is the only one unaccounted for .
you framed-him ...
whose area is this --
you killed him you fucking faggot --
before or after the explosion ? mueller --
west was one thing , but this --
at least we have an alibi --
yeah , right ...
you too ?
why not ?
what 's wrong with baseball ?
i just do n't like it .
you did basic here ?
there 's no need ...
why 'd you ask for a cop , ray ?
some .
that son of a bitch .
that 'd be my reaction too --
he 's lying .
we 'll just drop all your charges , then --
i did n't shoot west --
i apologize --
you saw west 's body .
and he 'd been shot .
you shot childs and nunez .
you saved kendall 's life --
we 're not finished yet --
we do n't need the tapes --
he -- he made me do it --
do what ?
you know the rest .
and the bodies ?
had that shaking thing , whatd'yacall it , epoxy ?
epilepsy .
he said he worked there --
about the business childs ran ?
where ?
back up .
mueller was alone in the cabin ?
where 's the cabin ?
ohhhh , i do n't think so ...
how do you know that ?
cadet , what 's your name !
sir , dunbar , sir !
you know how to work a pistol , dunbar ?
sir , yes , sir !
what the fuck is going on ?
he would n't kill anybody ...
shut up . let me see your grenades .
jesus , what happened ?
close .
so you killed him ?
whose blood is that , jay ?
what do you mean , west 's ?
where have you been , jay ?
roberto , what the fuck ?
we just want to check your pack --
you know it 's not like that --
right ?
i did n't do this thing , ray .
it 's not in me .
if not you , then who ?
mueller .
that 's exactly what he says about you .
you hated west , mueller loved him --
bullshit .
look in my pack .
why ?
combat grade morphine . mueller sold it to me .
you 're lying --
how was he killed ?
full clip to the body --
from up close or far away ?
his chest was hamburger --
they ?
i ... i do n't know ...
what do n't you know ?
's --
i 'm the victim here .
i am a homosexual .
what happened to `` degrees '' ?
i did n't kill him --
but i was ... enough to almost kill him .
but you did n't .
he admitted it .
why did he come back for you ?
he rises and walks to the door .
somebody emptied a full clip into him --
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --
rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer .
is it the truth ?
no . i said dunbar .
well ?
why ?
how do you know ?
i did n't --
i do n't know --
where are they !
maybe --
maybe what --
how are you ?
i should have called --
that bad ?
if there was any other way --
but the sergeant ...
who killed pike ?
we need a confession .
nevertheless --
kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .
you mean not enough to save you .
tom , where are you going --
home , i 'm done .
what the hell are you talking about --
what i said before --
you think dunbar 's on the level ?
yeah .
that 's horseshit and you know it .
you think you could explain all this to me ?
they 're taking your command , are n't they ?
i 'm sorry , bill .
you 're a good soldier , bill .
you could n't let him testify , could you ?
stay where you are .
or what ? you 've gone round the bend --
that 's preposterous --
i wanted to see if he was okay --
i 'm not even going to dignify that --
and that 'll be enough .
you 're crazy --
hostile and uncooperative .
ah , christ
you knew sergeant west ?
i did n't mean that as a compliment .
cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall --
levi ? who names their kid levi --
senator jonathan kendall , of ohio .
he 's in interrogation ?
yes .
move him .
is he cute ?
excuse me ?
is dunbar cute ?
good cop/bad cop ?
baseball ?
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
you 're right . we should sit in silence .
we 're in the middle of a murder case --
there was never any real doubt of joining up .
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib .
something like that . you ?
you 're kidding .
i plan to grow on you .
you 're off to a late start .
something wrong ?
being back here . gives me the willies .
kid gloves .
i do n't think he 's capable of murder .
why the fuck was n't he in restraints ?
goddammit , hardy , you ca n't just leave --
sorry , no can do . i tried .
i guess i was wrong --
nobody will ever know what happens here --
why do you care ?
i did n't shoot west ...
what ?
at least you and kendall agree on that .
buttfucks the cabin ?
that bugs you too ?
little bit .
we 're fucked , i know --
they got their stories straight .
are you sure ?
i pushed him too hard .
you could n't have known --
yeah , i could 've . should 've .
you wanted to get the truth .
for fucking over the little guy .
you wanted to break him .
yeah .
think it 'll work ?
plus , i got kicked out .
for what ?
we were close to something with kendall .
no .
four --
hardy , what are you doing --
hardy , for chrissakes --
no bodies , no west ...
we need to talk --
what ?
this is n't the time --
so now you get mine .
what if i do n't want it ?
that 's not true .
always degrees .
you 're a good man , hardy .
west ?
do i have a choice in this ?
what are you doing out here ?
think it 'll work ?
nah .
probably not the best time to hit on them .
i should probably write that down .
he was your friend .
how ?
maybe we should n't go .
the faggot speaks .
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
poor fucker was practically blown in half --
pike and i got separated --
yeah and he does n't know when --
i remember now , it was before the explosion --
i was freezing from the hurricane --
so you took off your shirt ?
we just want --
clear as day .
no one else heard it ?
nunez was chasing dunbar .
because he 'd shot mueller .
but you did n't see it , right ?
pike never confessed .
fifty minutes .
dunbar says you were .
it wo n't work --
enjoy your flight to washington --
wait --
dunbar 's telling the truth .
who , levi --
what happened with nunez ?
what the fuck happened to you --
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first --
thank god ...
we got ta move --
where 's your shirt , mueller ?
yeah .
no , no that was cadet dunbar --
so ?
he 's not army , it 's not official --
you think he did it ?
what do you think ?
you want kendall , do n't you ?
we know .
great , great . that 's fantastic .
your friend just made himself a star .
but then i lost her .
that or die alone .
real pretty , blonde hair , blue hat ?
yes !
i know her uncle . friends of the family .

you do n't even know me .
you could get any girl .

i love you , too .
i wanted to kill him .

it would n't have changed the way you feel .
i know it 's a dream .

i do n't know what to do without you .
see that tram coming around the corner ?
yes .
i told them i believed you ...
who is pamela landy ?

how long have you worked for the agency ?
is that clear ? ?
what kind of problems ?
amnesia ?
good luck .
am i a doctor , no , but ...
are you an expert in amnesia ?
i was there . i believed him .
so he fooled you .
if you say so .
i met him alone twice .
dangerous missions ? life and death ?
you mean , did i want a date ?
did you ?
they were dobermans .
some women like dobermans --
is it fresh ?
what do you think ? is he coming in ?
he wanted out . i believed him .
let 's give him half an hour .
so ?
do we know what this says ?
anything ?
munich 's a bust . he 's loose .
he never did . he was murdered .
by who ?
in room 645 . then she shot herself .
common feed .
are we hacking or asking ?
yes . in that order .
or was it all about judgment ?
it was in latin , sir .
but ... what will you do ?
and defeat the english on their own ground .
so i tell you this is what we face .
we must sue for peace .
peace ? !
sir william . we come to seek a meeting .
so let the council swear publicly .
young robert , we are honored --
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes .
does anyone know his politics ?
it is the crown that matters !
and scotland is william wallace .
he wo n't come .
longshanks promised !
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms !
what news of the north ?
and you have done nothing ? !
wallace has sacked york !
we recruit from scotland for our armies in france .
the scots will fight for us ?
now they must serve us or starve .
but if we have not caught wallace --
it will be worse than before !
and what was so important about it ?
no , m'lord .
now , my flower , do you understand ?
if i may be excused , m'lord .
good day to you , m'lords .
wallace 's followers .
perhaps you should think of our coronation .
when will his trial be ?
you fancy him .
i 'll wait ... back there .
a hundred spears . fourteen feet long .
the bruce is not coming , william .
stephen ready ?
and for bringing 'em yourselves .
rest , william .
i rest .
you know it 's a trap .
we know that . this is the only way .
i do n't want to be a martyr .
that 's just a dream , william !
a dream of freedom !
is that it ?

they 're coming !
how many ?
three , maybe more !

test of manhood .
you win .
could you crush a man with that throw ?
you 'll move
good to see you again .
a common thief .
we must run in different directions !
but i think your face looks graver than mine .
with courage alone he nearly won .
so more men were slaughtered uselessly !
he lost all will to fight .
!
so he accepted our bribe .
no . he did not .
my scouts say he has not advanced .
what kind of man is he ?
not a king like you , m'lord .
you may return to your embroidery .
and a fool .
i have faced him . have you ?
let her speak .
treason . against whom ?
do you confess ? ... do you confess ? !
your father does n't like me , does he ?
thank you for accepting .

i want ... to marry you !
i ... accept your proposal !
i 'm not just saying it !
you scare me .

i 'm dreaming .
yes , you are . and you must wake .
i want to stay with you .
and i with you . but you must wake .
i need you so much ! i love you !
your husband is secretly sending an army north .
he should n't be telling secrets in bed .

peace is made is such ways .

what 's the crazy man saying , lord ?
someone must have given it to them .
who would do such a thing ?
come , it 'll help you sleep .
can i have the picture ?
and i feel bad for mentioning it ...

just have him write down everything he does .
why ? what for ?
and the bad news ?
it 's harder playing detective now .
what kind of stress can he have ?
evan wake up , oh please wake up !

for you to help me .
shit . i knew you were crazy .

weirder than this ?
what did it look like ?
i thought you were loco !
he 's as handsome as his father .
dad lives here ?

what do you see now ?
i have n't seen results exactly like these before .
the outer lining of the cerebral cortex .
we do n't meet for another hour .
where are my goddamn books ?
books ?
alternate universes with colleges , prisons , paraplegia ...
but i ... i need those books .

not since we were kids .
i 've stopped a hundred times .
so how 's tommy ?
no . i emancipated myself when i was fifteen .

it 'd be a big help .
i 'll try to remember . shoot .
robin hood or something ?
it was a long time ago .
i know , but ...
jesus , kayleigh , you 're ... incredible .
where ... where are my clothes ?
why would that freak me out ?
where 'd you learn all those new tricks ?
so it did n't feel ... weird ?
it 's beautiful .
why are you doing all this for me ?
maybe one of the frat guys has a gun .
yeah , right . tell that to crockett .
are you okay ?
like how ?
you do n't even walk the same .
it was beautiful , but ...

so how 's tricks ? sorry , occupational humor .

i 've been where you 've been .
ha ! where 's that ?
what 's happened to you ?
why 's that ?
because you 're ... different .
different ? how ?
yeah ?
oh ? there 's proof now ?
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that .
i just thought you should know .
know what ?
there 's one major hole in your story .
where are we going ?
you 're having one of your famous hemorrhages .
it 's crossed my mind from time to time .
and ... ?
then you think it might have worked out ?
what happened ? where did we all go ?
nice work , daddy .
sound okay to you , papa ?
... yes .
you could blow your hands off !
you 've seen pictures of me , right ?
you study for this ?
we 'll find out soon enough .
you 're kidding . are these the answers ? !
damn , evan , on the d.l .

only two weeks until your science projects are due .

and you are ... ?
evan treborn .
smells like sex in here .
thumper had a busy afternoon .
i 've been keeping journals since i was seven .

that should buy you ten minutes at least .
i could n't cut the rope .

are you sure you even packed it ?
i do n't get you lately .

lenny ? come on !
shut up , tommy !
here you go , buddy .
i 'm not touching that thing .
maybe it went out . should someone check it ?
monsieur rick ?
you 're under age .
i came with captain renault .
i should have known .
my husband is with me , too .
do you mind if i do ?
is his word --
who told you to ask me that ?
he did . captain renault did .
how long have you been married ?
he wants to help us .
does he know that ?
yes , monsieur .
and you want to know --
-- will he keep his word ?
that would be all right , would n't it ?
you want my advice ?
oh , yes , please .
monsieur rick , i --
thank you , but i hardly think --
good .
such a bargain . but that is your decision ?
yes , monsieur .
no thanks , carl .
how long can i afford to stay closed ?
oh , two weeks , maybe three .
in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
then i am going to the meeting of the --
-- do n't tell me where you 're going .
i wo n't .
goodnight .
herr rick ! we escaped in the last moment .
it might attract the police .
but sacha always puts out that light --
-- tonight he forgot .
i want you to take miss lund home .
the cashier would like some money .
well , i 'll get it from the safe .
you know i ca n't understand --
mistakes like that happen all the time .
here you are .
it shall not happen again , monsieur .
here 's to you , sir .
er , good luck , yes .
i 'd better be going .
er , my check , please .
er , goodbye , sir .
hello , rick .
it 's not for sale .
you have n't heard my offer .
it 's not for sale at any price .
what do you want for sam ?
i do n't buy or sell human beings .
maybe he 'd like to make a change .
i 'll take my shipment with me .
have a drink with me .
the news about ugarte upset me very much .
and i 'm a poor businessman .
and the carrying charges ?
i think you know where those letters are .
that still goes .
rick 's would n't be rick 's without them .
i 'm sure in a little while --
thank you very much .
rick ?
but it is worth a chance .
good day , mademoiselle , monsieur .
and mademoiselle ?
occupied france ?
uh huh . under a safe conduct from me .
there are only two other alternatives for him .
-- it was `` la belle aurore . ''
not an easy day to forget .
no .
the germans wore gray , you wore blue .
say goodnight to sam for me .
huh ?
we said `` no questions . ''
a franc for your thoughts .
i guess that 's about all they 're worth .
i 'm willing to be overcharged . tell me .
and i was wondering .
yes ?
why there is no other man in my life ?
uh huh .
there was . he 's dead .
my german 's a little rusty .
where were you , say , ten years ago ?
where were you ?
you are in danger and you must leave paris .
we must leave .
yes , of course , we --
i 'll meet you at the station , huh ?
why ca n't he marry us on the train ?
here .
no . no , rick . not tonight .
please .
i can understand how you feel .
how long was it we had , honey ?
i did n't count the days .
can i tell you a story , rick ?
has it got a wow finish ?
i do n't know the finish yet .
yes .
i 'm reasonably sober .
i do n't think i will , rick .
i think i 'm entitled to know .
you can believe that if you want to .
you 'll be there .
how did you get in ?
well , wo n't you sit down ?
richard , i had to see you .
we 're back in paris .
what an important cause he 's fighting for ?
it 's poor salesmanship .
get them for me .
i 've got them right here .
put them on the table .
not even hope . then i met you .
what about now ?
here 's looking at you , kid .
have n't you told him ?
no , not yet .
you were able to arrange everything ?
everything is quite all right .
but why my name , richard ?
because you 're getting on that plane .
last night we said --
but richard , no , i , i --
but what about us ?
we got it back last night .
and i said i would never leave you .
hello , sam .
it 's been a long time .
a lot of water under the bridge .
some of the old songs , sam .
where is rick ?
when will he be back ?
uh , he went home .
play `` as time goes by . ''
you are very kind .
this time they really mean to stop me .
i must find out what berger knows .
be careful .
goodnight .
goodnight .
we are only interested in two visas , signor .
please , ilsa , do n't be hasty .
could we have a table close to him ?
what happened with rick ?
what did you find out ?
apparently he has the letters .
yes ?
did he give any reason ?
he suggested i ask you .
ask me ?
ilsa , i --
yes , victor , i was .
is there anything you wish to tell me ?
no , victor , there is n't .
be careful .
are you ready ilsa ?
sam ?
yes .
he came from paris with rick .
hello , rick .
well then , perhaps you also -- -
i 'm afraid major strasser would insist .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .
and about victor laszlo everywhere .
and i congratulate you .
what for ?
your work .
thank you . i try .
i hope we did n't overstay our welcome .
we 'll come again .
good morning .
good evening .
you see , here we are again .
go ahead .
my office .
you fought against the fascists in spain .
i suggest that you ask your wife .
i beg your pardon ?
i said , ask your wife .
well , this might come in handy .
thank you .
had a close one , eh ?
i mean what you 're fighting for ?
i brought the money , monsieur blaine .
keep it . you 'll need it in america .
but we made a deal .
no . it 's all arranged .
everything in order ?
you said you knew about ilsa and me .
i understand .
monsieur laszlo , is it not ?
yes .
i am captain renault , prefect of police .
no , captain , please .
that is a much more pleasant word .
my bill .
a precedent is being broken . er , emil !
tomorrow at ten at the prefect 's office .
we 'll be there .
did you have a good night 's rest ?
i slept very well .
nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca .
may we proceed with the business ?
with pleasure . wo n't you sit down ?
i am afraid not . my regrets , monsieur .
monsieur , insofar as it is in my power --
yes .
this is hardly the time or the place .
is that all you wish to tell us ?
even in berlin .
for the time being .
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca .
it 's very good to be here .
but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .
good evening , gentlemen .
ho , diplomatist !
mademoiselle .
a leader , like laszlo ?
but everybody 's having such a good time .
the place is to be closed .
but i have no excuse to close it .
what is the meaning of that phone call ?
why do n't you stop him ?
you would like to be on it ?
why ? what 's in lisbon ?
i came to casablanca for the waters .
what waters ? we 're in the desert .
i was misinformed .
what , again ?
he can not possibly escape .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
it will amuse your customers .
yeah ? have a brandy ?
yeah ? what 's his name ?
victor laszlo .
he stays in casablanca .
it 'll be interesting to see how he manages .
manages what ?
his escape .
oh , but i just told you . --
this is the end of the chase .
is that a serious offer ?
i 'd like to get it back .
i am only a poor corrupt official .
okay .
why two ?
he is traveling with a lady .
he 'll take one .
and got well paid for it on both occasions .
the winning side would have paid you much better .
i have my orders .
yeah , you were saying ?
mademoiselle , may i present --
oh , no , rick never --
oh , it 's my party .
rick , have you got these letters of transit ?
louis , are you pro-vichy or free french ?
so yvonne 's gone over to the enemy .
as i suspected , you 're a rank sentimentalist .
yeah ? why ?
why do you interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
huh ?
one you 'll appreciate .
what friend ?
the last man i want to see in america .
germany ... vichy would be very grateful .
oh , thanks .
you 'll still win at roulette .
sam 's piano .
not for a while yet .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
i have . sit down over there .
that will make it even more official .
you think of everything , do n't you ?
well i was right . you are a sentimentalist .
she went , but she knew you were lying .
i 'll have to arrest you of course .
i could be induced to arrange a passage .
you still owe me ten thousand francs .
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses .
our expenses ?
will i see you tonight ?
give me another .
sacha , she 's had enough .
make it official , if you like .
what is your nationality ?
who do you think will win the war ?
are my eyes really brown ?
mine is running a saloon .
hello ?
put that phone down !
get me the radio tower !
hello , rick .
well , what makes you think i have n't ?
will you have a drink with me please ?
no .
is that so parasitic ?
renault or yourself ?
will you keep these for me ? please .
for how long ?
perhaps an hour , perhaps a little longer .
i do n't want them here overnight .
rick ! rick , help me !
you ca n't get away .
i like it fine here .
boss !
yeah ?
boss , ai n't you going to bed ?
no .
you ever going to bed ?
no .
well , i ai n't sleepy either .
good . then have a drink .
no . not me , boss .
then do n't have a drink .
boss , let 's get out of here .
i 'm waiting for a lady .
ai n't nothing but trouble for you here .
i know she 's coming back .
shut up and go home , will you ?
one in , one out . sam ?
uh , my watch stopped .
what 's that you 're playing ?
just a little something of my own .
you know what i want to hear .

you missed the shipping lanes .
you 're putting off the inevitable .

why do they have to die for me ?
i 'm lost . goodbye .
take a little swim . sleep .
you quitter you quitter you quitter .
the sea is lovely , dark and deep .

it 's a fucking soccer ball , you idiot .
what 's so damn funny ?
jesus .

no wonder it 's so late .
you never gave up .
you know what happened to this ?
as much as anybody .
get dry for a minute .
hmmm . feels like it might have gotten wet .
possible . so you did those wings ?
yeah . a long time ago .
they 're harder to do than they look .
oh ? you 've tried ?
primal . truly .
well , not really , i --
to tell you the truth -- you did .

a ring . i wanted a ring .
i love you . but i have to go .
you ca n't go now .
i have to .
this is n't working out .
it 's christmas , maybe we 're over-reacting .
`` we 're '' not over-reacting .
could you watch jango ?
no .
that 's your dog .
it 's our dog . it belongs to us .
there is n't any us .
i got a little carried away .
maybe a little overkill --

chuck , you 're breaking my heart .
a week , max . okay ? okay ?
i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ...
i got married .
i thought you might have .
i would never --
i know .
if i 'd known you were alive --
i was a mess .
her name 's hannah .
is that jango ?
what 's that ?
what 's that , written on the sail ?
there was a coffin ?
yeah , coffin , headstone , the whole thing .
that about sums it up .
maybe now 's when you tell me about it .
yeah ?
that 's the headline . i survived .
come on . try .
live each day like it 's your last .
so simple to say , so hard to do .
busy every minute . always plugged into something .
this is so unfair .

i love you , chuck .
you too .
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg .

you do n't see the big picture .
i did n't know we had sailboats .

permission to come aboard , sir .
permission granted .
may i ask , where are you bound ?
only if you can afford it .
how beautiful you were !
you were n't dreaming about me .
then i was n't beautiful .
you were ! you *are* ! it was fantastic .
the board of trustees wants to *replace* me !
they just want you to hire some new help .
he 'll need clothes ... some money ...
you 've completely made his up !
what 's his name again ?
i 've seen him do it !
he has to .
i 'm *not* a doctor !
i mean your parents .

you cook very well !
and that i can drive a truck !
i think mary agnes could kill someone .
what 's she so emotional about ?
what 'd she die of ?
what are you going to tell the little ones ?
it 's time somebody ate *them* .
they made him a captain already -- *captain* worthington !

you 've seen only one movie ? which one ?
but you looked as if you liked it .
and what did she die of , exactly ?
she died of a broken heart .
what 's the *medical* explanation ?
you were born to drive a car like this .
have you seen a lot of movies here ?
at least you were never lonely .
you do n't miss it ?
i miss reading to the boys .
but you had so much *responsibility* .
i never *asked* for any responsibility .
sometimes ... movies mostly bore wally .
ah-ha . so what is that -- a radio ?
how could you not *care* about the movie ?
you do n't *come* here to watch the movie .
i 'd watch the movie .
i *know* this was right .
do you want me to stay ?
it will be okay .
*what* will be okay ?
you might have told me yourself .
for how long ?
i began my adult life with him .
that 's all there is to it then .
something about her father not letting her go anywhere ...
she wo n't go to st . cloud 's !
it 's her decision .
you do n't understand ! it 's her father ...
mr. rose *knows* ?
i 'll do whatever you want to do .
nothing .
is n't that like waiting and seeing ?
i 'm afraid to see him , too .
i know . is *that* nothing .
please do n't move , do n't go anywhere .
let 's just sit here all night !
stop it ! just cut it out !
i know , i 'm sorry .
he 's *paralyzed* !
he still loves you . so do i .
this is how i helped you , right ?
`` ... did . '' well , okay .
do you think she 'll be all right ?
with everything happening , i guess she forgot .
you have every right to be angry .
how is that wally doing ?
hi ...
homer and i can take you ...
i ca n't go nowhere .
it 's *muddy* ! is it muddy ?
so many children . are they all orphans ?
it might get cold .
wally thinks apples are boring .
there ! you said it was boring .
i love you , wally .
you 've been giving him a *flying* lesson !
he thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches .
i thought they might take me .
they wanted a girl .
that 's true .
nobody 's asked for me , have they ?
nobody special enough , curly .
you mean somebody asked ?
her temperature is a hundred and four .
that 's a heavy sedation .
what do you think ?
i just wanted to ask you ...
is *your* father dead ?
cirrhosis -- it 's a disease of the liver .
*liver* killed him ?
*alcohol* killed him -- he drank himself to death .
but did you know him ?
barely . it hardly mattered that i knew him .

she looks after other people 's children .
did you grow up around here ?
no . she was an immigrant .

no . dr. larch will be performing the procedure .
what kind of plane are you flying ?
a b-24 liberator .
liberator ...
have you enlisted ?
really ! is it serious ?
has anyone offered you anything to eat ?
i wonder if you might give me a ride .
be glad to ! uh ... a ride where ?
where are you going ?
i think i 'd probably like the apple business .
you 're a little overqualified , are n't you ?
i need a job .
it 'll take a little time .
there 's a *war* !
`` burma run '' because you fly over burma ...
they 're migrants .
migrants ?
it 's almost like flying .
candy , too .
so . what should i do now ?
ai n't that right ?
i do n't see no reason to read them .
there have to be worms .
this is easy -- i 'm not hurrying .
but she 's your *daughter* ...
please listen to me ! *both* of you ...
what business is you in , homer ?
i 'm stayin ' , homer .
first pregnancy ?
yes , for both .
there was no visible wound ?
it looks like scurvy .
it 's obviously an aborticide .
christ , it 's oil of tansy !
in other words , scurvy .
i have n't read that .
but is n't fuzzy just ... well , underdeveloped ?
where 's the name sheet ?
nobody 's named this one yet .
he 's a boy , that 's why .
ca n't a boy be a dorrit ?
i do n't think so .
henceforth you shall be ... little wilbur .
it 's your splice , is n't it ?
i thought it was my turn .
i 'm happy i amuse you .
nobody will ever adopt him .
homer , i 'll see you tomorrow ?
how long 's this been going on , muddy ?
rose rose ?
what 's that ?
it 's just my heart .
it 's slightly enlarged .
so what ?
do you like to read ?
i 'm not in trouble .
you 're not yet three months , are you ?
but you do n't look very happy .
i ca n't have a baby .
i can take care of it myself !
that 's *it* ?
that 's it .
who cares ?
now , now . he 's a good boy .
you just got ta go fishin ' .
do you know him ?
they never saw captain worthington 's parachute , either .
then it 's malaria ?
no autonomic effects ... that 's correct .
when will he be home , major ?
they told me i was too old to serve .
mind your own business , peaches .
do n't this place look like home ?
they 're *outrageous* , them rules !
and who do you suppose taught her ?
*you* taught her , i suppose ...
that 's what we say , all right .
where do you think you 're going ?
we do n't need no help .
rose rose has runned away !
she took off in the night !

they 'tend to scare people off .
there in lies the catch-22

big.com . that internet thing .
sort of like a letter of intent .
and you have this letter of intent ?
we had to finalize the deal .
everything looks in order .
this has to happen fast .
i know . it wo n't go unnoticed .
what 's this ?
let 's just slow down for a second ...
i already told you .
then there it is . ashby gets the itch .
the standard ten .
ten percent . of how much ?
you have to be able to see that deep .
and i think it 's because of this redhead ...
know who i am , jake ?
the anti-christ ?
gee ... what makes you say that ?
your life flashing before your eyes ?
just the last three weeks .
i can see why you liked her .
but there were other factors .
nice .
so three on a match is bad luck .
you 're a superstitious fucker .
luck 's a funny thing . especially the bad .
like what ?
was it love ?
i was doing it for them .
admit it .
it 's not true .
we were back on .
after you cut her loose .

and i thought you were a bright woman .
you do n't have to do anything criminal .
and that 's when it 'll happen .
you 're serious .
and i thought you were only after my body .
you 're honest . i trust you .

i said welcome .
welcome ?
how d'you know we 're `` friends '' ?
please ! please ! what are those ?
what are what ?
those things in your hands .
what 's the matter ?
you do n't know what you 're doing !
what ?
why ?
yes .
have you ever been to bed with anyone else ?
felt like this before ...
it was different ...
but you loved her all the same ...
we never went to bed together .
i 've never loved anybody !
it was my mother 's parting gift .
`` the fifth one this week '' !
oh , for goodness ' sake !
you are ...
five this week ; how many the week before ?
you 're as bad as my father .
we must n't let him land !
who ?
halfdan the black .
just give me a hand .
where 's the cloak invisible ?
no !
i 'll bring it back .
erik . you do n't understand .
we brought him here . we must stop him .
but you do n't realize ... .
and thanks for the cloak invisible !
hatred will destroy us .
the abyss will suck away your strength .
you still want to go to asgaard ?
of course .
do you believe i love you ?
i ... but i ...
just : do you believe i love you ?
yes -- i believe you do .
the second note .
you 've done what you came to do !
the note to take us home !
then i shall come too .
no ... no ...
i do n't want to live without you .
but --
you can all see me ?
how do we know this is the way ?
we blew the horn resounding .
what do you see , erik ?
i see the world .
is it night or day , erik ?
it is day , of course , freya .
is there nothing men can do ?
the gods are asleep , erik .
and will the dead ever return , freya ?
well , obviously there 's no killing .
it 's just the horn resounding is ...
a lot of people like our singing .
i 'm sure it 's lovely .
really ?
no .
we 're just not a very musical nation ...
no .
well , how d'you think i feel ?
i 'll tell you what ...
careful ! they 're not supposed to hurt you .
he 's trying to stop us waking the gods .
do n't talk nonsense .
he wants to kill us !
not when we explain about the great blessing .
is there something the matter with it ?
but it is ! look !
have you done this sort of thing before ?
looting and pillaging , eh ?
yes .
what about the raping ?
of course i like women ... i love 'em .
what -- rape ?
it is n't rape then , is it ?
oh , get it over with .
i do n't suppose ... no ...
about raping me ?
about not raping you ...
that 's just as crude , is n't it ?
oh well -- you 've got to do them .
to pay for the next expedition , of course .
oh ! stop talking as if we were married !
scream .
ah .
louder .
aaagh ! rape !
you told them i raped you -- why ?
i dunno ... you looked so ... so vulnerable ...
why should you care ?
why ... should you care ?
what a stupid idea .
have you tried to ask the god for anything ?
why should you care ?
find the rainbow bridge ?
`` but '' what ?
but ...
what are you talking about ?
it 's halfdan the black !
erik ! row ! what are you doing ?
how deep is the ocean ?
let 's hack her to pieces .
that 's terrible !
halfdan the black 's here !
i know !
you 're not even afraid of death , thorfinn !
it 's just a trick !
we 're missing all the fun ...
what 's it all about ?
you talking piffle , son ?
where does it all get us , grandpa ?
who have you been talking to ?
i met this girl ...
it 's always the women that start the trouble .
she got me thinking ...
i ... i ... killed her ...
i do n't want to go anyway .
slower ! nobody can row at that speed !
slower ! in ... out ...
faster !
what are you doing here ?
ohh ! i wanted to sit next to leif .
shut up !
look , the sky is blue ...
it 's magic .
what `` magic '' have you brought , erik ?
what did he say ?
you must help us .
but you 're the gods !
you mean we 'd be dead ?
thank you very much indeed .
now stop it !
it 's so nice to feel wanted .
harald , you 'd better sit over there ...
they 'll argue the whole time .
first we 're flying -- now we 're sinking !
a magic dishcloth .
were n't we supposed to ?
no ! let go , snorri !
i 've got you !
you 'll be sucked down too !
there is another way .
who gets killed ?
you need to say a bit more than that !
what 's the matter with them ?
just say something cheerful .
i think we should go ...
wait , erik !
he could have bjorn 's place .
what do you think ?
and you , keitel blacksmith .
well , what else do we do ?
well , i have a magic to match his !
she wants revenge !
what are you talking about , erik ?
only the dead reach asgaard , erik .
nobody 's ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard .
hey , you two ! what 's going on ?
look , i bagged it last week .
it does n't matter where you sit !
i am one , dad !
row !
she has n't got any .
hy-brasil ?
sven !
i came to find my grandfather .
bye , leif .
bye ... sorry ...
yeah ... well ...
you will wait ?
what 's all the panic about ?
it ca n't do you any harm ...
what do we have to do ?
how did he do that ?
do what ?
vanish into thin air ?
he has n't .
you 're wasting your time .
same thing , is n't it ?
you know , my son , our lord said ...
are you all right ?
he used to puke in his sleep .
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ?
and you keep wanting to go to the lavatory .
oh ! who cares ? we 're home !
aaagh !
let me go , sven .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm not worth risking your life for .
if you go ... i go too ...
i ...
well ! come on !
who 's that ?
i 'm just going to water the dragon ...
what ?
what are you doing , keitel blacksmith ?
get away , snorri .
you could charge halfdan fifteen for that one .
but i told him ten .
ca n't make enough swords !
they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky ...
the age of ragnarok ends ...
my brother blacksmiths !
that 's right .
the blacksmith 's code says i must ...
honour and protect all blacksmiths .
together we stand !
was n't it , keitel ?
are you going to let erik wake the gods ?
sh ! hurry !
i ca n't swim ! i ca n't swim !
relax !
urrgh ! argh ! let go , you idiot !
help !
help !
shut up !
she knows it was our fault !
keep your mouth shut , keitel !
but i did n't want anyone to get hurt !
i should have got rid of you long ago !
made by you , loki !
ragnarok was good for his business ...
it 's a tradition .
i know , dad .
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair ...
so did your father ...
so did my father and his father before him .
but it 's a responsibility ...
but it 's a responsibility being a berserk .
kill ! kill ! kill !
not now , sven ...
i must kill ! kill !
kill ! kill !
hold it ! hold it in !
well , of course he is !
there ! that 's a true berserk .
well , go on ! go berserk !
there is nothing we can do ...
he drove me mad !
dad !
he died of old age !
well i 'm certainly not , either .
well ... i 'm game .
shut up .
thorfinn ! you ca n't die !
i 'm not frightened ... of anything ...
you 'll see my grandfather in valhalla !
no ... he 's not ... not ... there ...
and you 've got both axes ?
yes , mother .
and something to sharpen them with ?
no , mother .
and keep your sword greased .
do n't stop to think about it .
it 's horrible .
just make a clean break .
you were n't supposed to see that .
it 's a nasty clementine hoax .
thanks , guys .
i hope you feel better , sweetie .
yeah .

i did . you said , things were fine .
i remember .
yeah , you told me that later .

i was ... you seemed nice , so --

take care .
i have lots of drinks . and i could --
um --
you like that ?
thanks . that was good , that crow sound .
do you believe in that stuff ? reincarnation ?

everyone wore hats . anyway , cheers !
take yours off .
i 'm fine .
ready for another ?
what do you want to hear ?
you pick it .
you just say . i 'm not really --
well , i should probably get going .
just for a little while . refill ?
no . i --
thanks .
y'know , i 'm sort of psychic .
do you believe in that stuff ?
i do n't know .
y'know ?
it 's hard to know .
you forget about those times . right ?
yeah , i guess .
i do n't know what to say .
thanks .
my goal ... can i tell you my goal ?
yeah .
you know ?
i think so . it 's hard to --
who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ?
yeah .
you 're nervous around me , huh ?
no .
do you think i 'm repulsively fat ?
no , not at all .
oh , yeah .
it gets frozen this time of year .
that 's scary sounding .
y'know ?
okay .
sounds good . but right now i should go .
would you do that ? i would like that .
so , i enjoyed meeting you .
you 'll call me , right ?
yeah .
when ?
tomorrow ?
just to test out the phone lines and all .

where are you going ?
i remember this . want to go ?
i want to have a baby .

hiding is clearly not working .
this is our first `` date '' date .

naomi , i guess .
yeah .
what was i wearing ?
i remember it matched the wallpaper .
egad , were you horrified ?
right . something black though .
i 'll buy that . black 's always good .
we did talk about naomi .
you seem unsure .
i 'm sure , i said .
but you were n't . i could tell .
you said :
so what . infatuation is good , too .
i dropped you off after . you said --
come up and see me ... now .
it 's very late .
i told her today i need to end it .
is that what you want ?
you did run away , after all .
but i needed to see you .
well , you 're married .

i remember that speech really well .
i had you pegged , did n't i ?

oh god , how horrid .
huckleberry hound ? that sort of thing ?
yeah , like that .

like insurance .
yeah ?

i wish we did . you married ?
um , no .
i do sort of live with somebody though .
male or female ?
cool .
what are you doing ?
this place is closed up . electricity 's off .
it 's dark .

meet me after work by the old mill .
what old mill ? is that somewhere we --
what took you so long ?
i just walked in .
hmmm . do you miss me ?
oddly enough , i do .
i guess that means we 're married .
i guess so .
yeah ?
did you send this ? is it a joke ?
who would even know to do this ?
it 's my voice on the tape .
it 's true .
i have to think .
hi , it 's joel .
you must have been crazy .
guess what i 'm wearing .
i do n't know . panties and --
your dried cum .
hi , naomi , it 's joel .
hi .
how 's it going ?
they said you were home sick .
i had to take the day to think .
did you get my message ?
i just got in .
that 's me .
it was snowing .
the driver waved . so casual , friendly .
i might be making a mistake .
fuck her .
i have no choice .
it 's them .
i should maybe talk to you .
clementine .
what a fucking monster she is !
so then she just stops calling .
not after the way she was .
and i remember , i said ...
how 's the chicken ?
she 's so sexy .
i 'll do it later .
naomi .
okay . i wish you could come .
clementine .
i really need to catch my ride .
like a dream upon waking .

i have been seeing someone for a little while .
oh ! great . that 's great !
a good guy . he 's a good guy .
i 'm sorry . i really should n't have --

that 's a good one .
it seems really appropriate .
yup .
smart ? important ?
let him go , stan . i can help .
such a gift howard gave the world .
yeah .
and howard just makes it go away .
it 's stopped .
what ?
he 's off the screen .
where ?
crap . crap ...
well , what should we do ?
i do n't know ! i just said that !
he ca n't wake up half done .
no way . i can handle this .
he 's coming ?
you better go .
hey .
do you swear you did n't know ?
i swear .
never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ?
you seemed caught . i waved . you giggled .
how did i look ?
and after that ?
you know that .
tell me everything .
you looked beautiful . you looked in love .
oh .
hi .
what do you want , stan ?
what 's this ?
nothing .
i know what it is .
then why did you ask me ?
mary , people come to him voluntarily .
remember the alamo ! remember the alamo !
howard , your one o'clock .
mary ...
yes ?
order me a pastrami for after ?
cole slaw , ice tea ?
thanks .
okay , we 're back in .
like a surgeon or a concert pianist .
do you like quotes , howard ?
how do you mean ?
is that nietzsche ?
it 's by pope alexander .
alexander pope ?
like i psyched myself out .
it 's no big deal .
that 's lovely .
i 'm happy to hear it .
i should n't have said that .
kids . you know that .
we ca n't do this .
what , howard ?
i want to do the right thing here .
i have a family , mary .
you made me have an abortion .
it was a mutual decision .
i love you ! how could you --
stan ? what 's going on ?
i ca n't find him anywhere .
okay , what happened right before he disappeared ?
i had to go pee .
well , where was patrick ?
he went home sick .
jesus . all right , what 's the address .
ah , your journal . this will be invaluable .
mary . what are you doing here ?
i tried that already .
did you try going through c-gate ?
i 'll take it from here .
howard , they 've disappeared again .
if no one minds .
unfortunately . i 'm really sorry .
you never know .
and only i know it .
the voltage looks fine .
does that help ?
i do n't know . stuffy .
we have a long night ahead of us .
yeah ?
just wanted to let you know .
i just do n't think she likes me .
i have a girlfriend now .
you can if you want .
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend ?
my girlfriend situation .
she was unconscious , patrick .
i 've never been popular with the ladies .
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties .
what 's your bartlett 's ?
my girlfriend is very --
patrick , we 're in the middle of --
he 's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway .
i 'm a friend of bonanza jellybean 's .
i know who you are .
if you could help ...
what was that ?
clockworks .
what do you believe in then ?
is everything getting worse ?
but everything is also getting better .
what 's happened to jelly ?
she had a one way-ticket to kansas city .
where do you live , miss hankshaw ?
i do n't .
tell me about it .
about ...
you 're political , then ?
it 's something i picked up from the chink .
what else have you learned from the chink ?
tension . cowgirl tension ! what a drag .
she 's a real dreamer , that debbie-dear .
you do n't agree with debbie , then ?
better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised .
no , i guess not .
'drugged ' is a stupid word .
extraordinary !
she 's turned my head .
how does she like what in bed ?
what do you think ?
well ... . er ...
whose fault was that ?
i 'm cold .
what are you doing ?
getting dressed . i 've got to go .
and tonight ... we can ... really make love .
i have to go , julian .

i was a successful model once .
so now you 're bummin ' around ?
yep .

and now you 're tired , poor darling .
a born freak can only go uphill .
bonanza jellybean ?
but she stinks like a slut just the same .
and what a job ...

i believe you might enjoy one another .
but countess ...
but what have you got to lose ?
i do n't know anything about it .

optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees .
something 's wrong with the bio-scan .
that 's an affirmative .
everybody okay ?
we 're all here .

what the hell is that ?
the safety circuit 's failed !
this ship is fucked .
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .

this is the lewis and clark , hailing ...
if they are , they 're screening their calls .
turbulence is dropping off ...

ben ?
what did you wish for , honey ?
i ca n't take this .
what about his first born ?
you always let this guy push you round --
we got what we wanted . that 's enough .
i can not do it .
its just like the shuttles you flew in --
a flight simulator .
five times .
i had it at four .
is n't that your speech ?
he 's made a few changes .
you should be the one up there .
the shields on the station should protect us .
i ai n't done arranging your flowers , egghead .
how long was i out ?
how are you feeling ?
i just keep going over and over the numbers .
even you ca n't compute every little thing .
yeah , you and debbie and perfect --
he 's smart , powerful , successful --
are you alright ?
what the -- !
ben . are you okay ?
we had a tough year .
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
it 's about to be a broken face .
ben --
we 're working as hard as we can --
ben ...
i think if we can rework the power settings ...
'course not . strictly business .
yeah , well , his eyes say different .

victor 's medical facility ... we 're in quarantine .
reed ? ... sue ?
you had the best --
hey ! that 's a prototype !
and vic 's gone mister hyde on us --
no more cracks about how i look .
every system is still functioning , somehow --
and they 're changing into ...
harder than diamonds --

what ?
but ... this disease ... is progressive ... degenerative ...
you 're hot !
so are you !
i mean , you feel a little feverish .
me like-y .
stay right . left is trouble .
i though we went over this .
you 're on fire !
not this again --
close the shields .
he 's not responsive --

the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .
better not be my nurse !
this is wrong in so many ways .
from outside the place looks a lot taller .
this place is deluxe . you got cable ?
back it down , johnny !
about flaming , that you --
just because i dress well and like to dance --
i ca n't put my finger on it --
you need to control yourself and think before you --
johnny . supernova .
but all these people ...
apparently i can disappear .
flame on , flame off --
stop it .
what is that thing ?
you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?
you 're really cramping my style here .
any hotter , you 're approaching supernova --

sue . your clothes . lose them .
that 's what we 're here to find out .
that 's what you projected on the bridge .
can you remember the exact emotions when --
anger . rage . frustration .
some memory or ...
i think it was a little more complicated than --
there were a lot of variables to consider --
what are you doing ?
and reverse the mutations --
reed ... ?
of course . of course .
reed . how close are we to a cure ?
you ca n't live in your head like --

it 'll crush you .
you sound as if you hate it .
are n't you ever going back ?
... not if i can help it .
gosh ! you 'll break a lot of hearts .
they 'll mend .
what ?
when you quit hollywood , i mean .
comrade ?
just one minute ...
hey !

who the hell cares what i think ?
not me . but other people seem to .
so who are you , then ?
oh yeah ! i saw you in the newsreel !
but i 'm not . the newspapers 're --

i 'll give it a try , mr. york .

you can make good money at it .
i ... i want so many ...
you do n't know what you want .
frances ...

why 'd they do it ?
how d'ya like the camouflage ?
you got real ability .
for old time 's sake .
harry ... i met someone .

yeah .
shit . i meant the other way around .
well , the studio told me not to .
is that why you did it ?
you 're telling me .
she acts like she 's on mars or something --
i think you better go back , kid .
not everybody lies , you know ?
makes 'em feel better .
the hell you will , harry york .
do n't start , farmer .
my glittering raiments are dissolving .
the chauffeur . he 's watching .
he deserves a show . he missed the movie .
i 'm serious , frances . this is important .
harry ? harry , where are you ? !
jesus , frances , how 'd you find me ?
just like that !
frances ...
how the hell do you find me anyway ?
no ginger beer . what 's this red stuff ?
what 's left of my blood .

i guess .
there 's only one other thing wrong with you .
what 's that ?
ohhh , that 's lousy scotch !
to quarter-horses .
why are you always leaving me , harry ?
huh ?

there 's just one more thing .

that would be okay .
pretty morning .
it 's always beautiful at this time . peaceful ...
and no people .
where you goin ' ?
yeah .
shit !

why did n't he show up ?
did you expect him to look you up ?

i need an incendiary ! an arsonist !
'but how do i know you love me ? '
your big speech ?
take me home with you . '
how 's it sound ?
the speech ? real good .

mama ...

it 's my life .
judge hillier spoke to alma styles --
i do n't care .
it 's okay .
mama , what 's ...
i 'll see you get the rest you need .
tell them who i am !
he says that ...
why are these all opened ?
then why did you bring them ?
it 's your fan mail , little sister .
you kill me , mama .
what ?
well , who have we here ... ?
i think i need a little air .
what 's wrong ?
i think i 'll just go out for awhile .

how long will you be ?
i 'll have lunch ready by one .
i 'll be back .
at one . promise ?

yes , mama .
i do n't want you drinking , frances .
i 'm back , mama .

mama ... ?
have n't you heard what i said ?
my only responsibility is to myself now !
you were a movie star !
mama , shut up !
where are you going ?
i 'm going out !
you 're supposed to nourish me ! support me !
in shame !
but what --
excuse me .
yes ... ?
do n't i know you ?
i do n't believe so .
no , my dear . you must be mistaken .
am i supposed to say 'thank you ' ?
thanks are hardly necessary .
it ai n't for lack of trying .
may we be serious for a moment ?
please sit down ...
and what 's that ?
normal . average .
will you please sit down now ? symington says .
... did you really say that ?
just a little joke , miss farmer .
this whole thing is a joke !
stay calm , please .
i 'll have someone show you to your room .
is there something else ?
did you enjoy your mother 's visit ?
yes . it was very good to see her .
you 're telling me you feel guilty .
she said something funny , and i said ...
and you accused her of tampering with your mail .
dr. symington , how big is your dick ?
frances , i 'm warning you ...
symington says ...
no ! no !
yeah ?
four hundred seventeen and no end in sight .
you 're kidding .
they sure hate to use that word .
what ?
you were with him at the end .
yes .
i could see you were a friend to him .
evil as you are .
in his own image .
you drove him to his torment .
and he drove me to mine .
then why weep for him ?
show me one now .
what kindness ?
nice .
better that way ... for me .
why ?
people are afraid . except you .
it ca n't be as bad as that .
you 're an outcast .
yes . i have been seeking my friends .
friends ? do they live around here ?
yes . very close
people can be kinder than you think .
come warm yourself if you like .
you speak .
two months now .
your elizabeth sounds lovely .
kill me and have done with it .
kill you ? hardly that .
what did you want with me ?
did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ?
you who murdered my brother .
your crime ... as well as mine .
how dare you . you 're disgusting and evil .
evil ? do you believe in evil ?
i see it before me .
good people ? bad people ?
materials . nothing more .
not things learned ... so much as things remembered .
trace memories in the brain , perhaps .
whose childhood friends were these ? who am i ?
i do n't know .
what can i do ?
there is something i want . a friend .
friend ?
like me , so she wo n't hate me .
and if i consent ?
soon ?
yes . i want this over and done with .
why ... her ?
what is this ?
a brain . extremities .
this was not taken from a grave .
she 'll live again . you 'll make her .
you will honor your promise to me !
i will not ! kill me now !
she 's beautiful .
she 's not for you .
get away from her ! she 's mine !
poor william ! what indignant tears !
do n't let your brother sway you otherwise .
elizabeth , really ! he 's quite mad !
scandalous ! what would your dear mother say ?
you dance so beautifully together .
nothing . still nothing .
it 's not like him .
so have i
i should go . i should leave today .
besides , they 're only rumors .
are you all right ?
have you seen willie ?
do n't cry , elizabeth .
are you sure it ca n't hurt us ?
what kind of god is he to will this ?
i can not do that alone .
god took her from us .
you 'll make him dizzy !
he needs to be comforted and held !
smell the air . wonderful .
quite a send-off , is n't it ?
father 's so proud .
and you ?
you 'll be the handsomest student there .
i 'll have to do better than that .
you will . what do you want , victor ?
i 've loved you all my life
this feels ... incestuous .
brother and sister still ?
i wish to be your husband .
i wish to be your wife .
marry me now .
who can run the estate ?
only you .
you make me weak .
our decision . together .
your decision . for us .
i give you my soul ...
when our bodies will join .
victor . i love you ,
has n't this family suffered enough ?
is there something between you ?
i thought i 'd never see you again !
what sort of task ?
perhaps someday .
i want this family to live again .
why the change ? what about your work ?
is your answer yes ?
every moment we stay .
victor , tell me why ! trust me !
brother and sister no more .
so beautiful even then .
victor !
it 's going to ram us .
they want your assurance .
a warming wind .
how 's our guest ?
have the body removed from my cabin .
you 're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated ?
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes ?
no . but someday .
professor ?
i was just clearing my throat .
i am not mad .
are you having me on ?
henry clerval .
victor , victor frankenstein .
do you really think i 'm mad ?
rich old ladies and their daughters ?
can you think of a better reason ?
it was n't something one could miss .
you 're a comfort to me , henry .
writing about it in your journal wo n't help .
now you 've got him started .
only you would think of that !
everything in moderation , frankenstein .
they 'll hang him all the same .
you do n't know what you 're saying .
you 're making a scene !
he of all people should have cheated death !
you ca n't . death is god 's will !
i resent god 's monopoly .
that 's blasphemy !
no . he had more important work .
you have n't attended a single class .
it is time to concern yourself with life .
i want to finish it in waldman 's memory .
how much longer ?
what do you want ?
classes have been suspended . university 's shut down .
yes ? and ?
it 's been touch-and-go for a week .
a ... week ?
is that your diagnosis ?
it 's his turn for that just now .
you 've been going round-the-clock ?
usually here at your bedside .
everything in moderation , clerval .
they do n't stand a chance out there .
no . they do n't .
quite a place .
thank you , henry .
for what ?
what happened up there ?
are you sure you 'll be all right ?
we 'll hunt this fiend down together .
only if you 'll tell me who he is .
by my hand .
such a thing could never have entered my mind .
how did it come to be in your possession ?
paracelsus ?
or albertus magnus . cornelius agrippa ...
what is your name ?
victor frankenstein , sir . of geneva .
professor waldman .
victor , explain yourself .
krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
you seem impatient with your studies .
electricity .
we should be learning this !
hardly fit for the classroom .
something like this could change our fundamental views !
but not at the expense of your normal studies .
i doubt that decision is still mine to make .
why ?
re-configure the leads ?
victor . he was trying to be gracious .
what we need is a vaccine for death itself .
it 'll help restore you .
frostbite . gangrene . a simple diagnosis .
are you a physician ?
how is it you come to be here ?
ah . an explorer .
i heard .
creature ? a ... human like creature ?
you know of it ?
your men are right to be afraid .
the lives of your crew ?
do you share my madness ?
who are you ?
i 'll take care of you .
that 's why you 're all upset .
what monster could have done such a thing ?
the killer is still out there .
we should go now .
what 'd you see ?
it 's something about tomorrow .
tomorrow is another day .
melvin belli .
just in case .
it 's still early , anyway .

how long to fix ?
what 's this ?
turbine rotor 's shot .
i thought you said it was just a blade .
got ta replace the whole deal .
how much longer 's that gon na take ?
the right way and the wrong way .

how long ?
three , four days .
the shipping records are n't a hundred percent accurate .
went aboard .
it 's ours .
we 're damn , filthy stinking rich .
sounds like the hull .
she 's theirs .
we found her . she 's ours .
that we knock this guy off ?
we 'll have to re-consider our options .
damn barbaric is what it is .
that 'd be my guess .
but it 's gon na take time .
just do it fast .
dodge to murphy .
murphy .
cabin 400 .
what is it ?
you did n't hear it ?
on a passenger ship in 1953 ?

i do n't know what you 're talking about ?
i think you know .
the radio !
what about the radio ? !
you smashed it !
what ? !
do n't lie to me !
what the fuck -- ?
too liable to ruin your big payday .
conveniently enough for you .
yeah .
what the hell happened !
you 're up first .
use some of those bodies below decks for bait .
you 're late .
sorry .
do n't fall asleep .
what 's slow ?
could be a fishing boat .
you mean , before she sank .
then why did n't they take it .
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold .
that 's what i call a payday .
that 's a good thing ?
what 'd he look like ?

any dizziness ?
no .
headache , nausea , lights ?
lights ?
sudden flashes of light .
you okay ?
i just thought i heard something is all .
what ?
candy ?
coffee ?
what 'd you find up there ?
she was sailing up north , right ?
ever heard of the mary celeste ?
so what did happen ?
but we 'll never really know for sure .
you 're more practical than superstitious .
maybe the whole fat deal was insured .
take it easy , you 'll live longer .
did you see him ?
who ?
the guy . he just came this way .
what guy ?
there 's somebody else on this boat .
what ? what the hell 're you talking about .
just a minute ago . some guy .
are you sure ?
of course i 'm sure . i saw him .
you sure it was n't me ?
guess that 'd be me . again .
no cowboy shit up there , understand ?
got your light ?
murphy to epps .
epps .
you just shoot at something ?
greer ?
he needs a doctor .
how 's he doing ?
same . any luck ?
and that evening they issue a general sos .
the ah ... the radio 's out .
what ?
smashed it up pretty bad .
february first .
the same day she supposedly went down .
distress calls have been made . ''
collision ? with what ?
then their sos was real .
but where 's the damage ?
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
it 's not gon na hold us .
hey .
hey .
could n't sleep .
the what ?
are we smart enough to avoid that ?
i 'd seen ... something . someone .
not our mystery guest again .
as though they were showing me .
showing you what ?
innocent victims .
victims of what ?
something bad happened here , murphy .
that much i think we 've already established .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
murphy to epps .
epps , over .
epps ? you there ?
what do we do with him ?
what do you think ?
`` like wild dogs . ''
over the gold .
they went crazy .
what happened ?
we hit land .
what ?
i do n't think so .
murphy , do n't you see what 's happening ?
i think i see it pretty well .
i do n't give a damn about the gold .
greer to murphy .
they must 've pumped it before we left sitka .
of course they did .
let the buyer beware .
i must be in the wrong business .
you got that right .
red sky at night , sailor 's delight .
makes me think it might be in trouble .
too deep to anchor out there .
call the coastguard ?
it 's funny .
how 's that ?
murphy , goddamit .
we 've got every right to salvage her .
some classy tub in it 's day , huh ?
morning .
you 're up late .
how much you figure that 's worth , skipper ?
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
i heard that .
what now ?
greer ?
i do n't know .
nobody 's gon na kill anybody .
pretty low all around .
they probably stumbled across it just like we did .
never been more thirsty in my life .
how 're you feeling ?
what happened ?
you do n't remember ?
down somewhere in there scavenging around .
you 've been out for about a day .
oh , man .
any idea what you might 've seen ?
it 's a noaa buoy .
a what ?
we 're still drifting .
ca n't find the shotgun .
so whoever did this now has our shotgun .
what about the gold ?
leave it .
let 's be reasonable here .
what seems to be the trouble , ladies ?
or you got your hearing aid turned down ?
i thought you say tuesday .
better late than never .

they 're seymour 's .
seymour ? you got ta be kidding me !
well , here 's where the fun never stops !
really having a good time .
maybe she 's got another boyfriend .
yeah , well ... thanks for cheering me up .
i agree .
did you remember to pay the phone bill ?
yeah .
who is responsible for this ?
i am .
what do we have here , margaret ?
this shocking image of repressed femininity !
she 's not at home ?
no ... they said she was here ...
she was supposed to be here three hours ago !
i really need to talk to her .
maybe she was just hiding from you .
maybe she 's with josh ?
josh ! ? why would she be with josh ?
i do n't know .
is she having some secret affair with josh ?
i have no idea - i just want to ...
did she say anything to you about me ?
yeah , she thinks you 're a dork .
did she say that ?
considering how we met you .
what do you mean ?
on that pathetic fake blind date .
what are you talking about ?
god , she really is pathological ...
thank you , doctor .
seymour ?
yes ?
you were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic ; very sudden .
let me see the sick .
oh , you 're a doctor now , too ?
there is no reason for fear .
morning , friend , glorious day .
i am a man of peace .
am i to take it you want to live ?
most certainly . absolutely . yes .
go and enjoy the splendid morning .
starting now , we attack them .
can you do that ?
you 've never built in africa .
but i have in india- every country presents problems .
pleasant journey ?
lovely sound- they seem happy .
do n't they , though ?
i do need to see starling .
is he here ?
yes he is .
it has n't been that simple so far .
and it worked ?
understand , i had help-
then why do you stay ?
but you do n't seem excited .
you do n't enjoy killing , do you ?
i seem to have lost the knack .
you never had it .
-then he feasted on him , starting with his feet-
-please- you need n't be so graphic-
very good indeed .
we have hunted since childhood .
he just gave me his `` monster '' speech .
anything special about them ?
how long have you been here ?
beaumont says it 's to end slavery .
but i know god smiles on me .
excellent . could i see the bridge site ?
finish your tour ?
why `` of course '' ?
i do n't suppose i could watch .
might be exciting for you .
i would n't be in the way ?
and i 've hunted all my life .
the pain is actually quite unbearable now .
... one shot ...
how lucky we are .
i think it 's because of the lion .
john , it will not be easy .
but you said they were always old .
second death ? where ? -
what a good week .
you mean nobody died ?
i did n't have a chance to thank you .
what did i do ?
got me out of trouble .
nonsense- samuel would have done something .
see any problems ?
actually , no .
i 'm redbeard .
that 's very considerate .
have you ever led trackers ?
i can try .
... misfire ... it jammed ...
has it ever done that before ?
think about something else .
have you ever failed ?
goddammit !
excellent notion- i used the same device myself once .
together they became lethal , together they killed .
what happened to them ?
have you ever seen anything like this ?
they 're only lions , yes ?
i 'll be bait alone ?
can you control your fear ?
you think they 'll come then ? why ?
good luck .
why ?
how many do you think they 've killed ?
why do the workers look unhappy ?
the workers do n't get on ?
did it look like this in your mind ?
i am also liaison between these two .
what are they looking at ?
you- they can not believe you 're still here .
fires burning at night .
oh yes , i think so .
for you .
thank you , samuel .
good news ?
i expect so- it 's from my wife .
do you love her ?
i do , actually ; very much .
soon .
you like him , do n't you ?
oh yes . but it takes time .
you 've known him long ?
why does he need you by him ?
it seemed a good idea once .
he has children ?
where is it ?
afraid of lions .
how many cattle ?
four should do it .
did you ever see a lion that size ?
and stay there .
where do you go next ?
you ?
too soon to tell .
some mysteries should not have solutions .
perhaps i could take you to lunch today ?
do i have bad breath or something ?
i 'm sorry . perhaps some other time .
janosz ?
you want me to come in ?
honestly . thanks anyway .
do n't let the bedbugs bite you .
what do you want with my baby ?
everybody has a choice .
he 's vigo !
we do n't have a relationship .
think about it .
believe me , i did n't imagine this .
okay , whatever you think -- but not venkman .
oh no .
do you ever see him ?
occasionally
how is he these days ?
then he crossed the border .
does he ever mention me ?
will you call me ?
i wo n't .
i 'm a building superintendent .
you 're also a human being , frank .
he takes the grocery bags from her .
i asked you last week .
no , you did n't , frank .
okay , that 's no problem .
have n't you ever seen my show ?
what do you think ?
what 's his name ?
his name is oscar .
oscar ! you poor kid !
i 'll do it .
that 's where the buggy stopped .
i feel personally responsible for you being here .
you wo n't go to prison .
i always land on my feet .
good luck .
so this is what you do , huh ?
oh , hello , peter .
you 're really good , you know .
are we having a pajama party ?
were you wearing this nightgown ?
just do n't pee in it .
peter , what about the bathtub ?
or we could do that .
i think i should put him down now .
are you all squeaky clean now ?
so , what do i do now ?
trust me , you need it .
she 's one of my most valuable employees .
does she know anything about babies ?
i brought along some interesting possibilities .
i thought they were dirty .
so tell me why did you dump me ?
i 'm not even good for me .
you 're so much better than you know .
maybe i should call janine .
i think i do too .
that 's not true . it was 1620 .
that 's a terrible thing to say .
thanks for coming .
always glad to help -- and hug .
is this the spot ?
sorry !

i 've seen you on television .
nice meeting you .
dr. venkman ? dana is not here .

i command you .
you 've got to do something !

the witness is leading him . sustained .

i could lose my license .
you 're a doctor .
like what ?
i got you out of those bad tax shelters .
it 's just a scared little baby , sherm .
wait ! okay , i 'll meet you there .
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster .
yes , i did . we were city champs .
that 's where we come in .
egon !
hello , venkman .
i 'd like to have a stool specimen
that 's a thousand million electron volts .
you were supposed to help me with this .
`` i 'll be back ? ''
let 's save this until tomorrow , okay ?
the positive gev 's are climbing .
so far so good .
from where -- neptune ?
they came from ostrov in eastern poland .
who was that ?
looking for goat hooves . come up with anything ?
nothing . not a trace .
seems like a pretty open-minded guy , huh ?
i 'm egon --
six feet -- seven -- eight --
that 's it . it 's on the bottom .
come on , ray . try me , sucker .
do n't shoot ! you 'll hit ray !
is the line sinking ?
rivers of the stuff !
late renaissance , i think . caravaggio or brunelleschi .
oh , hiya , pete .
so , no goat hooves , huh ?
what 's up ? how 's it going ?
great . so what are you guys working on ?
oh , just checking something for an old friend .
who ?
who ? just -- someone we know .
who ? who ? who ?
aaah ! nobody ! i ca n't tell you !

well , holmes , what do you think ?
geez , i forgot how heavy these things are .
i 'm ray --
this is what you do with your spare time ?
did you find anything at dana 's ?
let 's finish up and get out of here .
we thought you might want to come along .
let me know what you find out .
absolutely incredible !
it looks like a giant jello mold .
my fault !
what 's your story , pete ?
ready ?
i 'm ready .
i 'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds .
after all we did for this city .
now that 's one ugly dude .
huh ? what ?
you finished here ?
what ? yeah .
you coming down with something ?
are you telling me how to drive ?
no , i just thought --
are you all right ?
ray , i was ready to kill you .
and pure --
kind of makes you wonder , does n't it ?
wonder what ?
that water 's cold and i ca n't swim .
what are you , dana ?
are n't you glad we waited ?
it probably would 've been the same .
roy ? your clock broke .
nice going , honey . it was brand new .

we 'll stop in for a drink .
are you the gatekeeper ?
i 'm getting used to this .
not that i remember anyway .
i 'm peter venkman . may i help you ?
we 're all professionals here , miss ...
there was nothing there .
why would anyone make up a thing like that ?
is that your professional opinion ?
it 's my favorite instrument .
really ? do you have a favorite piece ?
i 'd have to say prokofiev 's third concerto .
you really do n't act like a scientist .
no ? what do i act like ?
like a used car salesman .
that 's too bad .
what ?
uh-huh .
well , let 's check it out .
you 're quite a housekeeper .
i told you , i ...
damn !
are you all right ?
all right . what do you want to do ?
i think i should spend the night here .
that 's it . get out .
on a purely scientific basis .
out !
i want to help you .
i 'll scream .
do n't scream .
then leave .
all right .
okay . then i 'll go .
goodbye .
great rehearsal .
you heard it ?
you 're good .
who 's the stiff ?
i do n't suppose you 've read it .
by the ... what 's that say ?
one of their gods .
what 's he doing in my refrigerator .
all right . since you put it that way .
what is it ? what happened ?
we must prepare for the coming of gozer .
should we make some dip or something ?
he is the destructor .
i want you inside me .
i am zuul . i am ...
dana , speak to me ...
there is no dana . i am zuul .
this one took some work .
our fees are ridiculously high .
you are to vacate these premises immediately .
this is preposterous ! i demand an explanation .
that is one speedy mutt .
are you the men from the university ?
i 'm dr. venkman and this is dr. stantz .
what 's that got to do with it ?
did you see it ? what was it ?
print is dead .
i also play racketball . do you ever play ?
is that a game ?
do you have any hobbies ?
i collect spores , molds and fungus .
oh , that 's very - unusual .
i think it 's the food of the future .
i 'm afraid you 're going to die .
die in what sense ?
in the physical sense .
i want you to have this .
it 's my lucky coin .
i do n't believe in luck .
i have another one at home .
hold all my calls , janine .
she paid with a visa card .
the epa ? what 's he want ?
it was never ever this bad , though .
did you ever report it to anyone ?
can i help you ?
i represent the environmental protection agency , third district .
great ! how 's it going ?
are you peter venkman ?
i have ph.d 's in psychology and parapsychology .
i see . and now you catch ghosts ?
yes , it would .
and may i see this storage facility ?
no , you may not .
and why not , mr. venkman ?
because you did n't say the magic word .
and what is the magic word , mr. venkman ?
may i please see the storage facility ?
why do you want to see it ?
have it your way , mr. venkman .
you can believe mr. pecker here ...
all right . what is it ?
a square ?
circle ?
nervous ?
yes . i do n't like this .
what 's this one ?
two wavy lines ?
i 'm getting a little tired of this .
it pisses me off !
hey , mister ! can i see those guns ?
they 're not guns . they 're particle throwers .
i just want to see 'em .
yes ?
were you recently in the bathroom ?
oh ! you 're here .
what have you got , egon ?
i 'm always serious .
did you see anything ?
something was definitely here .
there 's something i forgot to tell you .
what ?
do n't cross the beams .
why not ?
trust me . it will be bad .
i 've got a problem .
does she want to be ?
does that make any sense to you ?
venkman ? are you there ?
i agree .
where 's the keymaster ?
he started a secret society in 1920 .
let me guess -- gozer worshippers .
she said he was `` the destructor . ''
who ?
gozer .
you talked to gozer ?
what now ?
on the count of three ! one ... two ...
it 'll kill her ! and us !
life is just a state of mind .
sorry , buddy !
where are you ? are you all right ?
it 's working !
set entry grid .
i 've got to sleep .
what happened ? ? ! ! ! ?
scared the socks off some poor librarian .
let me know what happens .
and what have you seen ?
what do you mean by `` seen ? ''
i told you it 's real .
what do we do now ?
i do n't know . talk to it .
what do i say ?
anything ! just make contact .
this is not working . think of something else .
you call that science ?
you know what this could mean to the university ?
'they ca n't stop progress .
for what purpose ?
everybody has three mortgages these days .
wow ! does this pole still work ?
how do you like it ?
how much ?
it may have a history of psychic turbulence .
how was your date ?
they will .
so do i .
no sense worrying about it now .
ray -- something 's here .
where are you , pete ?
third floor . get down here ,
sit tight . i 'm on my way .
it 's looking at me .
do n't move . it wo n't hurt you .
how do you know ?
boy , that was a rough one .
who was the architect ?
agile bastard , is n't he ?
it just popped in there !
what ? what popped in there ?
and you came up with that ?
we used to roast stay-puft marshmallows at camp waconda !
are you a christian , ray ?
mmmhmmm .
me , too .
boy ! solid cores of shielded selenium .325 .
do you believe in god ?
no . but i liked jesus ' style .
and the seas would boil ...
right . and the sky would fall ...
judgement day ...
stantz ? you okay in there ?
what 's he talking about ? choose what ?
my gods ! the air is turning into ice !
we 're nearly there , lucilla .
that 's what you told me two days ago !
and stay there ?
surely you can drink more than that .
do n't you think you should at least wave ?
was n't this his day to die ?
right in front of the senate .
if i may be so bold ...
for the gods , spit it out !
kill him ! tribuus -- execute that bastard .
tribuus ... tomorrow .
you 're coming back ?
where have you been ?
the people have bread and the city is quiet .
what is that ... wailing ?
what are you talking about ?
yes ? go on !
i am their hero !
not yet , dear brother ...
likely just the weather .
respectfully caesar , quintus and i must report .
that 's difficult to say , general .
then you 'd be out of a job .
gladly caesar .
but they 're not destroyed , not yet .
caesar ?
they wo n't break this one .
where is my family ?
caesar , ignore them .
the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better .
how many days is this going to go on ?
you know , that 's not a bad idea .
maybe it 'll crush gaius .
i 'm serious .
so am i .
make them a gift of food .
give away food ?
take grain away from the army ?
marcus aurelius has died .
it 's because he comes off as the underdog .
where is my father ?
was narcissus killed ?
yes , caesar ?
you got the attention of the crowd , legate ...
and do n't tell me you do n't know !
i do n't know ...
the brass craftsmen are working overtime .
i 'll nose around ...
you know the senate 's arguing your case ...
he was born on august thirty-first , you know .
will you write it ?
god of my ancestors .
i 've read of it .
the trouble is defining exactly what 'right ' is .
we needed to know what you believed .
that 's who i hear you are .
not a gladiator .
why you ?
are we just going to be executed ?
sneaking around with your brother ?
it 's a little embarrassing .
why do you play at being drunk ?
he 's going to die , is n't he ?
you can not die .
he killed his father and then my family ...
where are they ?
so i understand .
the senators admire you .
they fear me .
i made the plume from a quail feather .
tomorrow ?
as soon as i can .
on your honor as a roman officer , daddy ?
what the hell was all that about ?
have you told your troops that ?
my troops do n't make policy .
you brought the army into rome .
he 's very realistic .
greeks ?
what about their philosophy lessons ?
they 're studying with cynics .
you need to come home !
i can see that ...
very fancy . did you design the bottle ?
or for the glory of you !
it 's just that marcus trusts me .
let him trust quintus .
quintus is overly idealistic .
i never knew a more idealistic man than you .
narcissus !
if i live i 'll come and get you .
teach them , who we are !
you teach them !
what was your crime ?
i killed too many barbarians .
what is going to happen tomorrow ? exactly ?
a gladiator at least gets a fair fight .
death is a very light thing for you .
take your hands off me animal !
and about you . that i promise .
i refuse to be your slave . i refuse --
now , show them what you can do !
i did n't get killed and everyone else did .
a fan sent them to you .
fantastic ! better than the real thing !
you get gold , what do i get ?
you get to come alive again in the country !
take my advice and make that bet .
how much money is involved ?
they do n't waste time ...
but i want more posters all over rome .
fantastic ! wonderful ! but posters are very expensive .
then get a large cash advance .
i do n't want to get sued over this .
before they leave , get gold .
i want nothing to do with the arena .
free your gladiators and come with us .
hello .
is that right ?
yes .
do you know what you 're going to do ?
no .
are you going to graduate school ?
do you always drive like this ?
do you want some dinner ?
are n't you eating ?
no .
benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason ?
no -- why should i ?

thank you .
would this be easier for you in the dark ?
mrs. robinson -- i ca n't do this .
you what ?
this is all terribly wrong .
benjamin -- do you find me undesirable ?
i just do n't think we could possibly --
benjamin , is this your first time ?
is this -- what ?
it is your first time .
that 's really a laugh . ha ha .
you can admit that , ca n't you ?
are you kidding ?
it 's nothing to be ashamed of --
wait a minute !
on your first time --
who said it was my first time ?
that you 're afraid --
if you want .
are you tired of it ?
well what do you want to talk about ?
oh my god .
well ?
think of another topic .
how about art .
you start it off .
i do n't know anything about it .
oh .
do n't you ?
i know quite a bit about it .
go ahead then .
neither .
you 're not interested in art ?
no .
then why do you want to talk about it ?
can i take off my clothes now ?
tell me what you did today .
do you really want me to ?
yes i do .
do you want to hear it or not ?
during the afternoon i read a novel .
what one .
what ?
what novel did you read .
there !
what ?
there 's something we could have a conversation about .
him ?
i do n't know the risk involved .
there is n't any .
how do you get out of the house ?
i walk out .
what do you say to him ?
he 's asleep .
always ?
benjamin , this is n't a very interesting topic .
what if --
the driveway 's on my side of the house .
we 're talking .
what ?
we 're talking .
calm down , benjamin .
now let 's keep going here .
can i undress and talk at the same time ?
right .
thank you .
no we do n't .
well how long has this been going on .
about five years .
oh no . are you kidding me ?
he gets drunk a few times a year .
how many times a year .
sometimes on his birthday .
man , is this interesting .
is it ?
you would n't say you --
we 've talked enough , benjamin .
so you would n't say you loved him .
not exactly .
but you do n't hate him .
i do n't hate him . unhook my blouse .
well how do you feel about him , then ?
when you first knew him .
no .
what ?
i never did , benjamin . now let 's --
why did you do that ?
see if you can guess .
well i ca n't .
do n't tell elaine .
you had to marry him because you got pregnant ?
all right . now let 's get to bed .
wait a minute . so how did it happen ?
not particularly .
and you were a student also .
yes .
at college .
yes .
what was your major ?
why are you asking me all this ?
now what was your major subject at college ?
art .
kind of .
well how did it happen ?
did you go to a hotel ?
benjamin , what does it possibly matter ?
i 'm curious .
we 'd go to his car .
oh no . in the car you did it ?
what kind of car was it ?
what ?
do you remember the make of the car ?
oh my god .
really . i want to know .
it was a ford , benjamin .
goddamnit , a ford ! that 's great !
that 's enough .
do n't talk about elaine .
do n't talk about elaine ?
no .
why not ?
i wish you 'd tell me .
do you understand that ?
i have no intention of taking her out .
good .
i was just kidding around .
good .
but why should n't i ?
i have my reasons .
then let 's hear them .
no .
let 's drop it .
i 'm not fit to --
is n't it ?
yes .
do you think i 'm proud of this ?
i would n't know .
well , i 'm not .
you 're not .
are you ?
that i 'm a sick and disgusting person .
now do n't start this .
what ?
did i say that ?
you would n't .
i 'm sorry i said those things .
if that 's how you feel --
but it 's not .
but if it 's sickening for you --
you do n't have to say that .
may i stay then ?
yes . please . i want you to .
it never occurred to me to take her out .
then give me your word you wo n't .
this is absurd .
promise me , benjamin .
i promise i will never take out elaine robinson .
thank you . benjamin --
so do n't get upset about it .
drive down the block .
we 're going for a drive .

almost a christmas scene .
goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
just one favor .

it seems highly intelligent to me .
it has drunk the blue soup .
blue soup ?
sounds quite beautiful .
like what ?
he 's a child !
load it , boy .
you 're begging him to kill you ?
if he thinks he 's man enough .
i 'm teaching my son to be a man .
you beg for a hero to kill you .
i plan to live one hundred years !

no .
i hope he never kills another human being .
i 'm going to call the police .
this is suicide . go get the police .
i 'm turning off everything .

don quixote .
my violin is avenged !
something seems to have happened to my self-respect .
it was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed .
the new hero is you .
i hate crowds , and i have no charisma --
no more guns , no more guns .
was i ever of use ?

who said that ?
i do n't know .
oh , those motorcycles are awfully chilly .
the ice is melting .
i like glaucus .
like a puff , harold ?
well , i really do n't smoke .

maude , i must speak to you .
what is it , harold ?
i 'm going to be sent away .
you have n't even got the vote .

oh , you were n't scared .
i was petrified .
how about some candy floss ?
you sure have a way with people .
look at the stars .
yes . they 're old friends .
do you think there is any life up there ?
i do n't know . perhaps .
you should have been a poet .
- end where i began .
maude .
yes .
why are there no photographs in these frames ?
i took them out .
why ?
it looks like you . thanks .
harold , that picture is almost twenty-five years old .

oh , harold .
... which i hope will make you very happy .
i could n't imagine a lovelier farewell .
farewell ?
why yes . it 's my eightieth birthday .
but you 're not going anywhere , are you ?
what a fuss this is . so unnecessary .
it 's part of life . it 's change .

i feel giddy .
maude . please do n't leave me .
oh , harold , do n't upset yourself so .
i ca n't live without you .

an accurate number would be difficult to gauge .
- then there 's the question of maiming ...
just give me a rough estimate .
i 'd say fifteen .
fifteen .
i would n't say `` benefit . ''

they tortured me here . in this room .

except that i 've got the box .
you 're still afraid .
you would be . they tore me apart .
so you were cheated .
yes ?
you ca n't love him .
i do n't .
so where 's the harm ?
she 'll tell them everything ...
she 'll want larry first .
that 's probably her now . or the police .

and do you like it that way ?
where have you been staying for the last week ?
this is really hard , you know .
good . so . is it my job ?
jesus , gim me a little credit , rob .
it 's one of the things i thought of .
what were the others ?
just the obvious stuff .
what 's the obvious stuff ?
i guess it 's not that obvious , then .
what ?
did you say something ?
so . is it working out with ian ?
rob . do n't be childish .
i 'm just asking how it 's going .
even if it 's only a remote possibility .
does that clarify the situation ?
yeah . great .
no problem . if i can ask one question .
fine . one .
it sounds stupid .
nevermind .
you wo n't like it .
just ask it !
is it better ?
is what better ? better than what ?
is sex with him better ?
is that really what 's bothering you ?
we have n't done it yet .

we 'll talk some other time .
so , how are you ?

i do n't have your number .
i know what you 're like .
hello .
it 's me .

i 'll talk to you later .
why do n't you go experiment .

you do n't ever think about other people ?
is that the last of it ?
those look heavy . where 's ian ?
i 'm sure .
that bad , eh ?
and you were living in this shitty place .
what do you call him ?
ray . i hate ian .
it 's everything else i do n't know about .
you know i 'm a good person .
do n't forget your cds .
those are n't mine .
sure they are .
i do n't know these people . i ...
okay , okay . i get the picture .
you 're being deliberately obtuse .
i guess i am .
hello .

i ca n't talk right now .
are you alright ?
pigsty .
worry about that when you 're better .
pig died .

do you want me to be there ?
look , are you coming or not ?
yes , of course .
i 've got too much to do .

mmnn .
i appreciate it . i ca n't reciprocate .
i do n't want to go back .
what do you want to do ?

i 'm saving them for later .
there 's nothing to worry about .

what about ian ?
let 's go home . okay ?
c'mon . i want to know .

to make you feel better .
or jamaica . or new york , even .

and i still do , and you do n't .

you 're tougher .
more confident , maybe .
harder .
i 'm alright .

you 're being stupid .
otherwise , what 's the use ?
hi .
hi . what are you doing ?
nothing .
wan na go to dinner ?
where ?
at paul and miranda 's . paul from work .
paul and i .
he helped me put out a press release .
what ?
it might even be why i came back .
barry said its done .
barry ? barry knows about this ?
you seem pissed off all the time , though .
are you worried about tomorrow night ?
i 'm going to talk to you .
to me .
ha ha ha . hoo hoo hoo .
i mean it .
i know .
oh , well thanks a fucking bunch .
would you marry me if i was ?
no . probably not .

do n't sulk . what brought all this on ?
i do n't know .
very persuasive .
are you persuadable ?
fair enough ?
fair enough .
about what ?
i want to think about something else .
i do . i will .
shut up . i 'm only trying to explain .
but were you really expecting me to say yes ?
it was the asking that was the important thing .
this place is about to get burned down .
rob here .
hey . it 's liz .
what 's happenin ' .
you called this morning ?
how 're you holding up ?
you know ?
you let me believe that !
it 's true !
it 's a crematorium .
you 're kidding . a crematorium ? jesus .
what difference does it make ?
is ray going ?
enough , liz .
but is this really the time ?
good . 'cause i 'm enjoying myself .
so you live in chicago now ?
hi , marie .
no big thing . a relief , actually .
it 's a great song .
you share a place with t-bone ?
i 'm way to unattached for that .
nobody 's heard the crumblers . except me .
the conformist .
exactly ! fucking ex-actly !
you have n't even seen it !
are you okay ?
yes . you ?
i 'm sure it is n't .
you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee ?
oh , right . alright .
so you 'll stay ?
yeah .
or would you like them on ?

that way . you ?
that way .
i 'll talk to you later .
i 'll call you .
yeah ?
hi , mom .

great . super-fantastic .
how 's the store ?
so so . up and down .
she left . she 's gone .
what do you mean ? where did she go ?
not say where gone . laura move out .
well call her mother .
you know that 's not what 's upsetting me .
well it fucking should be , should n't it ?
and after that ?
i knew this was going to happen .
then what are you getting so upset about ?
i 'd like to hear her side of it .
what do you think ?
it 's the best collection i 've ever seen .
give me fifty and get them out .
but you must have --
give it to charity . or something .
i want to be poisonous but fair .
there are plenty of others who will .
they 're worth five times that .
sixty .
thirteen hundred .
seventy-five .
eleven-hundred . that 's my lowest offer .
can i buy this otis redding single off you ?
sure . ten cents .
are you guys stealing for other people now ?
naw . those are for us .
i think you have more .
well we do n't .
records are those big round black things , right ?
we 're not there yet , justin .
i 'm vince .
nice .
even had a mark on his cheek .
how old is richard ?
says 41 , but he barely looks 30 .
yeah .
he 'd want to know about all this .
there 's a journal article in this somewhere .
if you 're ever in the neighborhood ...
i warned you .
does n't have a head , does he ?
i hardly ever see him anymore .
did n't think it was my buddy over there .
figured you knew more about swords than i did .
claymore .
huh ?
you 're the expert .
the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me .
you 're very macabre .
it 's my birthday .
happy birthday .
would you like more tea ?
he was unsual .
i did it right here at the house .
then you did n't know richard later on .
suppose nobody does .
i do n't follow you .
he died a few days after he was born .
the boy _died_ ?
have you spoken to anyone else about this ?
would you remember his name ?
-okay okay .
do you play ?
yes .
i 'd like to ask you about the claymore .
byzantine ?
basil the ii .
good reflexes .
grave robbers ?
probably .
who ?
people like that rarely leave business cards .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
you have an active imagination .
i have friends .
jesus christ .
he wo n't kill in a church .
why not ?
tradition .
he tried to kill me last night .
where ?
who is he ?
at the moment ? carl smith .
what will you do now ?
i 've been at this a very long time .
he called you `` macleod '' .
not your concern .
but you do n't really care , do you ?
that bothers you ?
he was innocent .
what about me ?
you ?
have you gone to the police ?
no .
i 'd rather hear yours .
you are being foolish .
he sees me as a threat .
no .
no one knows you 're here ?
no . i had to talk to you .
you had to do _nothing_ !
you 're wrong .
you 're a fool .
is this what you killed them with ?
you 've been listening to rumors .
they 're calling me an accessory to murder .
what 's all that ?
you did kill those men .
not all of them .
but that 's where you come in .
and all of it wasted . you love history ?
yes .
no . so what now ? we just wait ?
yes .
maybe it would do us both good .
it 's beautiful .
i 'll make a fool of myself .
william taupin seems to have left his mark .
yes .
and you are william taupin , are n't you ?
you 're using your son 's name .
then you must be at least 70 years old .
at least .
a factor of age .
i hope i never get that old .
but it 's not . it 's you .
i see .
i 'm not even sure why .
it 's in your hands . a clarity .
you are a very perceptive young woman .
who are you ?
that would be difficult to explain .
class of 1672 . it goes on .
that 's why smith called you macleod .
yes .
he knows about you .
that 's insane .
perhaps . there is something more . an inheritance .
of bodies .
i did n't kill the watchman .
you killed those other two .
not the same .
what about that family in '31 ?
there are differences .
you kill with your left hand ?
i have n't killed _you_ .
do n't .
come here , brenna .
what is it like ? being you ?
history i 'll only read about .
half lives that never go away .
what is it you want ?
you should be back by nightfall .
will i see you again ?
what 's wrong ?
what is it ?
get out .
no !
who would have guessed ?
the inheritance .
forget it .
i 'm just curious .
you flunked out of law school .
thanks .
a murder .
that 's my right .
i 'm calling an attorney .
you and i should talk first .
four ?
all fashionably without heads .
spare me the details .
what are you getting at , moran ?
knows all about that .
you 're an asshole , moran .
i want taupin .
what makes you so sure he 's the one ?
what were you doing in felton ?
never take up poker , detective .
corey , you _owe_ me .
it 's that important ?
good way to lose your job .
too bad no one else did .
who is it ?
i do n't believe him .
why ?
he has one , he might have two .
you see the crap piled up on it ?
requiem acer'nam donaei-
what are you doing man ?
-et lux perpetua-
you 'll not be bringing the church into this .
be quiet .
-auditorium nostrum-
stop .
-in nomine sanctus esperitu-
afternoon .
your name is conor ?
aye .
juan cid romirez . chief surveyor and alchemist .
you 're not from these parts .
your marks would suggest great injury .
i was nearly killed .
how can you know this ?
what is it you call this ?
pheasant .
back home the food is so ... domestic .
you know me home . me name .
yes . always .
does it change with me in the room ?
it is less .
you feel you know me .
i do n't know why .
i do n't understand .
you are still so very young .
i 'm twenty-two .
what ?
it is as you are .
listen to me . hear the words .
this is madness !
it is the truth .
it 's time you ate .
this ca n't be .
you are not dead , boy . accept it .
i 'll burn in hell for all eternity .
you will live . survive .
i am evil . this is god 's punishment .
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .
aye .
but we can not be killed .
then it is over . the end .
how can i stop such a man ?
in this i can help .
why ?
harder . concentrate harder .
me arm hurts .
harder ! you swing like an impotent cow !
impotent cow .
it will take less effort as you learn .
we 're raised as riders .
it is only a leaf .
i feel hardly nothing .
this is why our friend is so concerned .
much more .
and you ?
i am not ready for this .
do not become one of them .
of course .
how it can sap all pity , all love .
i have my friend to keep me company .
i 'm your future husband , remember ?
i have no future husband .
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands .
i 'm standing here as real as you .
but i did live .
saint andrew has smiled on me . on us .
some think not .
who ?
some call it magic .
surely you do n't take their word ?
but not from you .
leave me alone , conor . please .
oh please . another one .
what would you like ?
something pretty .
where did you ever learn it ?
far away .
david .
who am i deceiving ?
state of grace and all that .
tradition .
not so scared .
no doubt .
you 're wrong .
romirez understood . not you .
finish your prayers ?
finish yours ?
and i kill you .
complete your inspection ?
it will be a slaughter tomorrow .
the enemy has five brigades waiting for us .
we need more time .
it will probably be your last .
your name ?
what is your position ?
second musketeer .
i understand you joined up in bremen .
you seem to understand a great deal .
you would do well remembering that when addressing me .
i thought we spoke as equals .
equals ?
wait . i think we understand each other .
we have no understanding .
somehow a head always ended up on the counter .
it can be different . it must be .
we must talk .
stay out of it .
do n't threaten me , private .
you see major ? you are not so different ...
ah , conor , how you look a man .
must he go ?
it is his duty . all of ours .
but ian , he 's still but a boy .
at the top , hiding in old leaves .
where did you learn that ?
my father taught me .
your father must be smart .
figure she 's with him ?
yeah .
she 's right . there is no richard taupin .
any other i.d.s come up ?
out there first ?
where !
i do n't know .
smith . carl smith .
how many came ?
the last four .
and the bulgarian ?
he got him . he always does . eventually .
spare a chair ?
how are you ?
head still secure to the neck .
what are you doing here ?
and have you something to settle with me ?
tonight i have a drink with an old friend .
for a pope .
he found us even there .
i have n't drunk this much since-
ever since i was a kid .
i knew his great-grandfather .
you 're insane .
we used to shoot pool together in rangoon .
you 're marking time .
you 're wrong .
long time .
you 've been here from the start .
friend of yours ?
of sorts .
run !
leave her out of this .
what 's the point ?
this is n't done . get up .
you have me , finish it !
you will not cheapen it , little boy .
tradition .
it 's all we have .
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play .
leave her alone .
we have some unfinished business .
are you here ?
i want you to come to me .
yes laddie , i have her .
this your present address ?
your men came right after .
did you know the victim ?
what is your citizenship ?
what were _you_ looking for ?
that 's none of your business .
do you know what this is ?
i presume it 's a sword .
you would n't know anything about it would you ?
a mystery .
my condolences .
where were you tuesday night ?
home .
a neighbor saw your car leave .
do you ?
all i need is time .
ah steven , it is good to see you .
steven , conor did n't die .
but i had heard his wounds were mortal .
you 're one of william 's kids , huh ?
his only kid .
never seen a father and son look more alike .
we were very close .
the resemblance is amazing .
when may i expect the cleaners ?
morning mr. north
same .
mind you i 'm 74 now .
no .
nothing to be sorry about .
got anything new on the hanging ?
ca n't you say 'hello ' to a fellow ?
i 'm going into business for myself .
what doing ?
i 'm getting married tomorrow .
who is it ?
what 's the idea of locking this ?
bensinger -- of the tribune .
hello , bensinger .
nothing -- ah -- detrimental , i hope .
the poem ? ... the poem was great !
how would you like to work for me ?
mervyn , is n't it ?
no . roy . roy v .
sort of a jack london style ?
i got my rhyming dictionary in --
i 'll keep you in mind .
au revoir , mon capitaine .
oh , it is n't like that .
got a lot of charm .
too hot ?
he looks sunk , does n't he ?
and what 's the matter with a thousand dollars ?
how long will it take to get him examined ?
about twenty-five hundred dollars .
all right , dear .
have you got that money ?
i 'll get the tickets .
he 'd get you in a crap game --
please , dear .
five hundred . be careful , honey .
have you got it ? is it certified ?
now , are you satisfied ?
what 's the matter ?
i lost my wallet .
yes , was n't it ?
i ca n't think of any enemies i have .
but then i realized he could n't have been .
how could you ever think of such a thing ?
did you finish the interview ?
hildy !
bruce ! ! how 'd you get out ?
oh , she was here .
where 'd she go ?
four hundred and fifty dollars .
i got it back .
and you can meet us at the station .

yes !
attaboy ! come on , bruce .
where are we going ?
no -- she did n't .
how does it feel , bruce ?
mother ? but your mother --
no . my mother .
well , i 'll try to give her one .
are you going to live with your mother ?
just for the first year .
how 's business , bruce ?
anything the matter ?
just what is the lowdown on williams ?
how long would the interview take ?
another hour to write it .
i never knew hildy to be so determined before .
this makes me feel funny .
i 've got nobody else to leave it to .
i feel i ought to take care of her .
i love her , too .
well , she 'll know some day .
might start to rain again .
oh , sure . well , thanks for everything .
i should thank you . so long .
hildy !
she 's only a woman , after all .
what does she look like ?
that 's about the best description i know .
i just wanted to be sure .
you 'll ask me to what ?
get out !
you , too , burns .
you 'll see nothing of the kind , sheriff .
and you 'll be an accessory !
what about this , burns ? kidnapping , eh ?
call duffy !
no , you do n't !
what 's this ?
this is the morning post you 're talking to !
he 's talking like a child .
out of the mouths of babes .
save that for the tribune .
what do you want ?
hello , hildy !
how long is what ?
how long since we 've seen each other ?
seems like yesterday to me .
you would n't know the old girl now .
-- any time -- any place -- anywhere ! ''
i notice you still remember it .
done what ?
we 've got something between us nothing can change .
i often wish you were n't such a stinker .
you do n't deny that . do you ?

what ? ! !
i have a lunch date . i just want --
you can break it , ca n't you ?
no , i ca n't .

they 've got the real thing outside .
i 'm starting my own collection .
it 's not patriotic .
you hate jam . you never eat jam .
well , for the baby , really .
crocodiles ! aah !
but dad , it 's the news .

it 's like telling fibs .
what 's that ?
twenty-five-mile range , they have .
each shell costs as much as a ford 8 .
a bit too quick .
are those some kind of stockings you 're wearing ?
they might be .
boy , that was some air-raid .
air-raid ?
where ?
i do n't know ?
you 're just not saying .
no thank you !
caulk it like the hull of a ship .
flip of a coin .
and jim .
weeds will grow , mac .
i love them like my own . and you .
what about it ?
and it 's certainly not an avenue .
why not ?
how 's your war , mac ?
on the fiddle . like everyone else .
except the servicemen .
naturally .
is there any point to it ?
you always were , clive . steady the buffs .
do n't panic ! keep your head !
so you 're going to be a grandfather .

the ideas you get in your head .
and where do you think you 're going ?
what is it , pet ?
i was terrible to him .

i was better to make a clean break .
i do n't believe this is happening to me .
now take deep breaths , and push .
is it peace in out time ?
no , mother ! it 's war ! war !
up to six weeks , i think .
oh , you girls .
it was the best time of his life .
what 's the point ?
let them go , if they want .
it seems to have survived .
all those summers . out two families , together .
it 's all better left unsaid , grace .
and you never did .
he could always make me laugh .
we did the decent thing .
what would i have done without you ?
you might still have a house .
i wish it could all have been different .
and marjorie anderson .
never mind , you can stay with us .
they hated me for making them learn .
it 's selfish to keep them with you .
i could n't bear it .

to move beyond .
i 've been seeing someone . a therapist .
you are a therapist , right ?

tiny napkins of course .

rudeness , vulgarity , meanness are the norm .

he moves like an animal .
it 's perfect !
nathan , what the hell are you talking about ?

i was devastated . of course .
who 's that ?
is this a lover ?
forgery and fraud ?
i 've seen everything .
do you think that was his intention ?
i 'm too old for this bullshit .
he never even asked . he just assumed --
he was right , was n't he ?
so . now what ?
she definitely did a factor .
she did a harriman .
miles massey .
of massey myerson ?
do you know him ?

maybe .
one husband at a time .
and sarah , we were n't unreasonable .

why ?
where does that leave us ?
mr. rexroth .
rex , please .
thank you .
mm .
time marches on . ardor cools .
i do n't know . i can assume ...
has she retained counsel ?
i ca n't afford to give her anything .
what 's kirshner ?
she always looked out for me .
and she had private investigators assisting her .
she brought my digestive enzymes .
in anticipation of making you sick .

you see , i assumed you were coming here for
it gives me the jitters .
you 're a peculiar chap .
we 'll go into that some other time .
you were taken for a buggy ride ?
that 's an evasion .
she 's my idea of nothing !
do you love her ?
what 's this about not eating ?
no more cigarettes .
why do n't you put me in chains ?
i might .
you know i 'm going to have my way .

will you do that ?
if you really mean it , i will .
when 'd she eat last ?
she has n't had a thing yesterdayor today .
been sending her meals in regularly ?

it 's one of the largest in the world .
you talk as if
ellie ? oh , she 's no responsibility .
you never can tell .

the door was open .

you got it on the board .
he 's not talking about himself .

because she 's the type .
but you said you did n't know her .
she looks just like ...
i find it irritating , not to mention insulting .

just for that no hint today .
it would detract from the game .

not that you 're playing it very well .
what ?
what makes you think i was there ?
hello .

what about the blood ?
that 's great .
same as the others ?
yeah .
how long she been dead ?
well ?
what 's this all about anyway ?
what 'd he do ?
we 're not sure .
i 'm busy right now .
and this jeremy --
but we heard him .
anything else ?
why disguise your voice if no one knows it ?
his home would be ... mount olympus .
i 've seen the photo 's .
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end ?
we 're checking that out too .
each of those grids represents almost a square mile .
as large as castles .
what time did he get there ?
he 's right , kathy .
we ca n't rely on your judgement anymore .
we 're going to work on the message .
the most logical choice .
did you see his face ?
how long ago was that ?
ten days ago .
do you know how she found the apartment ?
did you know her ?
could you tell me where you were last night ?
here . i played gregory lutz .
please call me at home .
that would imply you already knew the number .
she 's a psychologist helping us out .
maybe i can help .
what have you come up with on the riddle ?
another one ? what word did he leave ?
the sonofabitch is playing chess with me ! !
you 're not making any moves against him .
what am i ?
a building ?
where were you last night ?
are we going to go through this again ?
answer the question .
jeremy would have never killed himself .
maybe he just got tired of covering for you .
we 're moving you to a cell .
did you send the car ?
he opened his first game with it .
he knows you 're aware of that .
we got a problem ?
david came up to fix it .
you 're always in the middle of a match .

just thought you might want to talk .

mate in five .

bainbridge books .

i stay here every time i visit my parents .
you know how parents are ?
are you with the tournament ?
uh huh .
are you one of the players ?
when did you start playing ?
when i was very young .
it seems like such a complicated game .
sounds very violent .
what 's your passion ?
that 's a very personal question .
what shall we discuss ? the weather ? movies ?
it is .
do you always open quickly ?
are we talking about me , or chess ?
you .
well , i think i 've had enough .
what are you looking for ?
nothing . i just came in for a steam .
they could n't break the riddle .
the one he wants to play the game with .
i 've got a game .
she could be dead after the game .
she could be dead now .
you sure you do n't want to eat something ?
you should try to eat .
you sound like my mother .
it was n't intentional .
i think it 's interesting .
another kind of game ?
in a way .
this is n't a game .
it has rules and objectives .
how can you look at it so clinically ?
they just learn to control it .
of course .
do you ?
let 's change the subject .
you mean like in the steam room ?
of course .
why ?
no .
you 're not ?
i know it was bad .
i know you didn't
you know , andy thinks you 're doing this .
does n't that scare you ?
no .
why ?
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it ?
no . but i 'm open to distractions .
what about you ?
was n't i just talking about me ?
no . you were talking about chess .
alright . what about me ?
i dunno . where 's erica mother ?
she died in a car accident .
i 'm sorry .
it was a long time ago .
it must 've been very hard on erica ?
it was .
i 'm not playing a game now .
yes you are . you 're playing word games .
you 're cut off from everyone around you .
you do n't even know me .
i just do n't want to fight with you .
this is not just another game , is it ?
i 'm hungry .
fine .
what do you want on it ?
you .
would you settle for pepperoni ?
did you call ?
i 'm going to go pick up the pizza .
i thought you said the line was busy ?
i tried again and got through .
what 's wrong ?
nothing .
peter , you have to admit --
peter ...
for emphasis ?
exactly . it 's the key .
what ?
hi .
peter ...
you ca n't feel responsible for that .
you do n't understand .
i want to understand .
it 's not that easy .
but i do .
why ?
this letter . i 've never opened it .
why not ?
because i know what it says .
it could be anything .
how did you know it was `` carefully '' ?
frank told me .
you 're right . the killer told me .
you 're going to be late for your match .
are you going to come tonight ?
you beat him .
i 'm glad it helped you .
i 'm sure you are .
you 're nervous ?
i had nightmares all week .

the wedding is at three .

they have lyssa !
you will go alone .
i wo n't leave you here .
the white castle has fallen .
does the queen live ?
the new queen lives .
turold 's son was to marry her .
i have no extraordinary powers .
have you ever seen one of these ?
while lyssa is in their hands ?
there is no other way .
there 's no way down .
you have rope ?
i am too old to climb down a rope .
there is nothing .
reach out farther . call to her .
how is that possible ?
the fortress moves ?
they will help us .
you choose these ?
i ca n't reach her .
what do you see ?
i can not reach her .
they are taking great risks .
< u > why < /u > ?
i 'm not sure .
but you suspect .
we will find another way to locate the fortress .
yes .
he has come for lyssa .
lyssa ? < u > why < /u > ?
he would make her his queen .
can she be forced ?
she must agree of her own free will .
never .
traitor ! she 'll marry you in hell !
for as we enter the vortex and move closer ...
the beast will kill her .
she must make a glaive .
the spiral begins in the west .
i can feel it !
i chose the wrong passage .
she can see the beast !
use your sword .
i ca n't reach her !
the beast will stop at nothing now .
you 're coming with us .
it is my fate to die in the fortress .
no ! you can not know that !
i can . because i choose it .
slayers !
do not let the waters touch you .
they can be saddled .
you have done it ?
i road them often in my youth .
it is today ?
each to his fate .
i know the cruelty of such a fate .
perhaps you think no man would return to me .
am i not worth returning to ?
yes .
am i not beautiful enough to be loved ?
yes .
even by you ?
you too are lonely .
i ache with it .
let me comfort you .
i can not take comfort when she has none .
then give me comfort . sleep with me tonight .
i can not betray my bride .
you will not , then ?
help ! help ! i 'm drowning !
the water is only an inch deep .
where is this place ?
a forest near the valley of needles .
what did he expect ?
what business ?
once is enough , thank you .
i was hoping i might be your friend .
my < u > friend < /u > .
i have need of friends .
it 's your tomato that 's dying .
you and i will guard the fire .
i do n't think you 'll grow careless .
now what do you have to give us ?
fame .
fame is what you leave to your sons .
hah ! you do n't know me , boy .
and where do you lead , boy ?
to the place where death lives .
it should be an interesting journey , then .
when did you last sleep , boy ?
even walled cities fall to them .
i 'm not hungry .
not sleepy , either ?
forgive me . it 's childish to cry .
well , i 'm not impressed .
you 've eaten nothing .
we must try to get horses .
all cheap .
it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination .
hand over your dinner .
go , join them .
what kind of friend do you think i am ?
go . i command you .
we could reach it on fire-mares .
we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise .
subject to the king , no doubt .
make for the wall . i 'll catch up .
you ca n't do battle with that thing .
nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals .
would you settle for a boar ?
you !
what is that awful looking place ?
be glad we do n't have to cross it .
where are you going ?
we 'll meet you at the inn .
ca n't i come , too ?
a venison pie as big as a house .
quell ?
my heart stays here .
got any gumdrops ?
no .
sugarballs ?
no .
boys always have candy .
i have a cinnamon bar .
you do ?
i 'm hungry .
i 'd wish for a puppy .
one puppy ? why not wish for a hundred ?
i only want one .
now you poke me in the nose as well ?
i do n't think it 's working .
would you desert your friends ?
put me down , you lout !
stop ! thieves !
they need food .
and do you think i live on air ?
we have plenty of hares .
oh , my poor stew !
look at its beauty . look at its grace .
look at its insides .
be gone !
you 'd best travel with us .
they 'll trample him to death !
it is hideous .
i do not want your worlds or your slaves .
it 's a lie !
he will betray you .
he will not !
he will come for me .
but the great desert forts have fallen .
he is a godfather of her own blood .
but fate and this war have ordained otherwise .
it is important to assure the succession .
but my parents chose otherwise .
i knew .
you knew ! you are a rude bumpkin !
a girl of some spirit , your daughter .
a match for your son , i think .
you were attacked in the forest ?
yes . we lost five .
only ten of us made it back .
we seek the fortress of krull .
who seeks it ?
the new king .
with an old voice ?
you know the voice .
it is the time , then .
it is the time .
can you see ?
knowledge i would n't want .
many have perished in that maze .
the leader of the dark ones ?
perhaps she will help .
the widow of the web ?
yes .
and none who go there return .
she has the power of vision .
her name is death .
few have survived it .
each to his fate , lad .
i 'll stay behind and keep them busy .
look .
kegan !
who speaks that name !
i was beautiful then .
the most beautiful woman in the world .
but you would not stay with me .
she was not as beautiful .
no , she was not as beautiful .
she bore you many children ?
we had no children .
you had a son .
you said nothing . you told me nothing .
i kept silent out of rage .
where is he ? my son .
do not try your trickery on me !
it is no trickery .
you see ?
the power to see .
what can my power give you ?
knowledge .
of what ?
when will it come near here ?
why must you know ?
her name is lyssa .
no .
it will not help .
i can not stop the sand .
go now , before it runs out .
you will come with me .
what 's that man 's name ?
give me his name , i will mail him .
ok. mister stansfield , norman stansfield .
... office 2702 .
yeah ... how do you know it ?
can you believe it ? !
you 'll see .
do you come back ?
come on , tell me ! i know him ?
no .
and did he pass your threshold or not ?
... what ?
well ... did you sleep with him or not ?
he 's very shy ... and very sensitive .
... good ... but what 's special in him ?
... you moved too , did n't you ?
yeah .
because of the slaughter at your same floor ?
the money i earn and you keep for me ...
no , no .
they are dangerous , you know ?
take ...
well , i do n't need them ...
ok , i 'm fine .

it 's too big .
there 's equally a lot of other things !
you have to grow up .
i swear .
poor darling , and then ?
are you ok ?
... do n't you drink ?
... no ...
how many girlfriends did you have ?
my family was not very respectable .
i hope you killed , that asshole ?
yes .
may i ask you a personal question ?
how long ago did they arrive ?
i do n't know ... five minutes .
how shall we get out now , leon ?
i do n't want to leave you ! !
mathilda , listen !
you say it just to calm me !
yes ?
good morning , mister ... it 's danielle !

i 'm sick with practicing , that 's it ...

yes ... twice .

it 's the only important thing in the world .
salute .
norman smiles .
i hope you 'll excuse my temporary bad mood ?
do you recognize him ?

aside from that .
she 's completely untrustworthy .
and c ) victoria principal sells on that network .
and d ) brooke is obviously hiding something .
but maybe it 's not what you think .
you 're kind of being a butt-head right now .
we ca n't see her for an hour ?
she 's ly-ing .
so ?
the what ?
i ca n't .
that is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination !
what the hell is that for ?
projecting joy is not my job .
you really think i 'm attractive ?
he 's gay ! enrique is gay !
how do you know he 's gay ?
hey --

i 'm an idiot .
in court . on opposing sides .
are you serious ?
did you ever take mrs. windham on a date ?
yes .
where ?
three months .
and what is your boyfriend 's name ?
but i guess it was n't enough for brooke .

elle ?
is it a kappa ?
helloo ... you let him videotape you diddling yourself .
let 's all go ! road trip !

why so few ?
fool 's magic .

you go to lady now ?
my generosity is not so large as that .
what do you want with me ?
your love .
it pleases me .
but i 'm hideous !
you 're magnificent .
grotesque ... monstrous ...
god protect me .
not from me , surely ...
you ... you 're a beast !
only most are afraid to show it .
and you ... are you not also afraid ?
i am afraid of nothing .
i wear this mask not for concealment but protection .
protection ?
why have you brought me here ?
to be my bride , of course .
damn you !
do it now !
kill me ... i want ... so nice ...
the pain remains constant .
sweet princess , you begin to sound most reasonable .
what do you want from me ?
i imagine you 'll enjoy a good meal ?
and then ?
yes ?
why should i bother with such a paltry trifle ?
what was that ? did you hear that ?
do n't trouble yourself , beauty .
it sounded like it came from the courtyard .
i never dreamed life held such pleasures ...
and , now ?
i 've never felt so strong or happy .
or looked so beautiful ...
weakness is what is ugly .
i did n't know ... i --
what ? speakee loud ! no hear velly good .
i thought this as empty tomb .
do i look like i wan na hurt you ?
i no flum here . i come flum cathay .
cathay ?
to the east , beyond the lising sun ...
east of mercia ?
flozen foleva not good .
it 's terrible .
how you rift cuss ?
i --
you come stealee tleasoo ?
no , wait ... please ... listen ...
some of our handiwork may be of assistance .
i 'm in no mood for dancing .
faerie ring ?
i want no part of your frolic .
mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure .
i meant no disrespect .
it 's bluebells !
what !
elderberry wine . no finer drink under heaven .
such a fine bouquet ... very aromatic ...
i am grateful for your hospitality and --
but ... but , why ?
big question that , lad . why what ?
why is it winter now , and dark ?
do n't you care about what 's happened ?
think that 's an enjoyable prospect ?
there must be an answer somewhere .
if ye want to ask , ask jenny greenteeth .
how is it this hag knows the truth ?
will you lead me to her ?
are we here ?
play the part of a girl-child .
what do i do ?
and if she thinks me a liar ?
twas the killing of the unicorn caused it .
aye . black baron 's mischief .
if the horn be restored the curse is ended .
there 's another in residence at lindfarne now .
and who might that be ?
you do the praying . i 've work ahead .
by the grace of god .
shhhh !
what is it ?
pregnant , is she ?
damn them !
i 'm second in command , damn it !
save your mischief for the black baron .
aye ! that too .
you 'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart .
the baron must have left a trail .
track the demon to his lair .
we must follow that bird .
but is this the right bird ?
i 'm sure . it spoke to me .
what did it say ?
beware .
she be our eyes .
this is ogre 's magic .
blackheart ?
his reward for delivering the unicorn .
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
the foulest . mayhap i can cut them free .
worse than the battlefield .
good .
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable .
and this ? some of their handiwork ?
a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly .
my god ! look !
something the matter ?
not so loud , mayhap he 'll hear ye .
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet .
certainly understandable .
i should hope not !
i pray always to be worthy of it .
i 'd say you and sigurd were neck-and-neck .
rest easy , jack .
we 've a hard day 's march ahead .
god 's blessing .
what make ye of that , jack ?
wait !
i 'll deal with this other creature ...
we 've lost our way entirely .
long as we do n't lose heart , jack ...
wait , jack .
hold , jack ! do n't strike !
i show no pity to imps and fiends .
can we trust him ?
never felt so cold in all me born days ...
give in to despair and all is lost .
why not mine the damned walls ?
defend ourselves . we 've bested far worse already .
easily spoken ...
shoot the damned things as they fly .
there are n't enough arrows .
water does n't burn ...
there is n't much time !
been telling you that all along , lad .
one more turn ...
have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory ?
aye . before the wee pesties attacked .
then it 's godspeed , screwball .
he 'll be atop the portculis ere long .
best get down close to the moat , lad .
aye . we 're good as inside .
we 've won , lad .
it does n't matter .
nonsense ! course it matters .
the wound is mortal .
can you save her ?
i do n't ... understand .
why should he do that ?
quickly now , give me the key .
sunlight , you say ?
aye . hurry now , gump , the key !
mean you to seek him out below ?
i 'm not afraid of the dark .
what weapon ?
sunlight .
plan on carrying some away in a kettle ?
will you explain what 's going on ?
hey ! stop it ! i ca n't see .
ca n't we move any faster ?
do n't get too far !
he was at my mercy !
never show mercy !
ride like wild fire , jack .
a good day for singing ...
i 've not heard a note out of you .
not in the mood , i 'm afraid .
i 'm not denying it 's a joyous day --
a faerie festival over a pile of bones ?
i 'll do anything ... face any challenge !
i was with the princess .
where ?
by the pond . she was teasing me .
said she 'd marry me if i did .
and did you ?
it completes the cycle ; answers the riddle ...
kill us another worm .
barely living , from the looks of it .
ogg lives there ... ! and thurgis !
we seek to undo the curse .
well done , lad .
three at once ! i ca n't miss !
sweet slippers of oisin !
how 're these ?
dolt !
these for me ?
you promised !
never .
but you did ... you did !
i may have said perhaps ...
liar !
sport , indeed .
blackheart . aptly named .
oh , fie . what about the unicorn ?
unicorn ?
a promise is a sacred oath .
i 'm so thirsty .
stop complaining .
a gentleman would offer water .
see yon viper ?
i detest serpents .
no animal will drink here now .
what shall we do ?
oh , dear .
what 's the matter ?
i 'll go search for it .
i 'm not its master .
i 'd rather not be alone .
how much longer ?
shhh !
you have no right to order me about .
they rival the angels of paradise .
it would thrill me so .
are you honest ?
jack !
he 'll not flee if i show myself ?
tis an awesome test of virginity .
where are you going ?
what happened ?
they 've hurt the unicorn .
who ?
my father and the baron .
i ...
they tricked you .
my own father ...
how bad was the unicorn 's wound ?
he was hurt and ran away .
he did run ?
oh , yes , and the mare with him .
i do n't want it on me .
do you wish to marry me , jack ?
i 'm afraid it may storm .
tis not fit for a princess .
be it fit for your wife , green jack ?
i have no wife .
then , perchance you 'll me .
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride .
wish you this our wedding band ?
lili ! no !
what have i done ?
i thought you were dead ... i --
i was bewitched ... it 's better this way ...
no ! i wo n't let it happen ...
you 've freed me , jack ...
what ?
sunlight ... it destroys him .
sunlight ?
that 's why he goes masked during the day ...
so , he 's hiding in the dark ...
in the dark ... where i join him ...
i love you !
what a dream i 've had ... proper nightmare .
i meant every word .
i want none other .
like a true prince ... a champion !
lili ... i love you !
what 's the matter ?
ouch ! something 's biting me .
biting you ?
pinching me !
pinching ? where ?
everywhere ! ow !
i ca n't see a thing .
oona ? do you suppose it 's a faerie ?
honored to make your acquaintance .
and what great cause leads you to me ?
step lively now !
the moon is too round of face , methinks .
all the heavenly angels must envy your grace .
the last stallion in all the country .
tell me one thing more .
ask away , sweet man .
what became of the princess ?
princess ? i know of no princess .
is she fair , this princess ?
exceeding fair .
she 's dead !
no !
dead , dead , dead .
tis not the time to speak of cheer .
you 'll visit again ?
courage , jack .
this is not the time for squabbling .
may n't i come visit sometime ?
i 'd be honored .
only that ?
and charmed , of course .
i should charm you for being so dull- witted .
i had no thought of offending you , oona .
do i not please you , jack ?
in every way .
and am i not fair ?
that was in jest .
jest with me then .
and sweet ?
nay , oona , tis not possible .
a faerie 's love makes anything possible .
i 'm promised to another !
you ... you ... you mortal you !
please ...
be fair , oona .
the raven passed this way hours ago !
the fastest in the world .
what do we do now ?
what 's she doing ?
i 'm in your debt , screwball .
praise be to god .
these woods are alive ! they 're alive !
where ?
what care the bones when the soul is free ?
have n't heard a bird sing in days ...

do you need help ?
it 's been a while .
i smiled at him .
let 's see if you 've gotten any better .
maybe you should n't come everyday .
i thought we were helping .
nothing is going on with us , is it ?

that was the truth .
it 's habit .
it sounded like a pick-up line .

well - i'm
you 're afraid of going to jail , eh ?
you see , i got this plumbing business
and mine 's conway .
it is not particularly far , but quite difficult .
and the wine - excellent .
who and what is shangri-la ? you ?
goodness , no !
so there are others ?
oh , yes .
who , for instance ?
you should have a record made of it .
you have no soldiers or police ?
oh , good heavens , no !
how do you deal with incorrigibles ? criminals ?
you have no disputes over women ?
they were .
well , it must have taken
centuries .
so we merely . . .
buy and sell ?
no , no , pardon me , exchange .
in fact , shangri-la is father perrault .
he amputated his own leg ?
it would have healed without amputation .
well , they did n't actually mean that .
well , is it ?
108 and still active ?
you 're startled ?
just a little bowled over , that 's all .
very often .
a little amazing , of course .
why , mr. conway , you surprise me !
i surprise you ? now that 's news .
yes . i 'm afraid it does .
shall we have another ?
charming , is n't she ?
yes , charming .
your brother seems quite fascinated by her .
why not ? she 's an attractive young woman .
when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
shangri-la will keep her youthful indefinitely .
suppose she should leave it ?
you could n't drive her out .
chang , how old are you ?
he could never get through that country alive .
what do you want ?
i thought perhaps-
you 'll soon be well if you do .
that 's fine . that 's just fine .
please let me help you .
you see , we have no porters here .
no porters here ! !

as far away as i ever want to be .
how can we get in touch with them ?
why , he 's been insane for years !
father perrault is dead .
oh george , you must take me with you !
chang told you that , did n't he ?
yes .
you 're lying , are n't you ?
are you taking me ?
you 've got to let me rest !
are you the high lama ?
it 's astonishing - and incredible , but
what is it , my son ?
who had that brilliant idea ?
sondra bizet .
oh , the girl at the piano ?
it was to be expected .
that 's why i came to you for help .
he is now your problem , conway .
yes .

i do n't know .
what do you mean if we should get out ?
did i say `` if '' ?
that 's what you said .
well - i mean
unless it was to meet us ?
chang 's first question was about the pilot .
nothing about the porters yet ?
george , what do you think you 're doing ?
george , come back !
let me up ! let me up !
what about the porters ?
porters ?
did n't you find out anything about the porters ?
you went out there for the purpose of
where 's your top coat ?
you ca n't leave , george .
why not ? what 's going to stop me ?
you 've got to stay here now .
you must n't either .
if you 'll only tell me about it .
except that you must be completely mad .
we 're living in the twentieth century .
did they show you any proof ?
it 's horrible .
is that all my story meant to you ?
it 's obviously a lot of bunk .
this is no place for you .
i do n't want to talk about it anymore .
you owe me some responsibility .
about their taking care of you , i mean ?
it 's all set . maria made the arrangements .
maria ?
yes , the little russian girl .
what 's she got to do with it ?
you ca n't take her away from here !
why not ?
why , she is n't a day over twenty !
you 're wrong , george .
i do n't believe a word of it !
you say the porters are waiting for us ?
yes .
the clothes ?
yes , everything !
what about the others ?
i never could have made it alone .

where did you come from ?
i 'm alexander p. lovett , sir .
where were you hiding ?
that fellow got on at baskul .
good .
what if he refuses ?
that 's what we 'll do .
i guess we 're in for it .
in for what ?
at the mercy of a mad pilot .
my name 's sondra .
what is it ?
was this your idea ?
what gave you the idea i 'd fit in ?
that was easy . i read your books .
what have my books got to do with it ?
i saw a man whose life was empty .
a man whose life was empty !
yes .
whether i was born here .
thank you .
i was brought up here by father perrault himself .
i talked to him last night .
yes , i know .
what is ?
am i so strange ?
i wonder .
beautiful ! i 'm waiting for the bump .
ouch !
have you never wanted to go there ?
that 's only to be expected .
why ?
a world full of people struggling for existence .
and do n't ask me why .
would you like to wring my little neck ?
i 'd love it !
am i forgiven for sending for you ?
he knows what he 's doing .
what do you want him to do ?
what is it ?
why , he 's speaking english .
how about you ? do you want to go ?
go ? where ?
i 've got porters to take us back .
why , i have my classes all started .
i will . i 'll wait .
you 'll wait till you rot !
excuse me
i waited for so long .

you the sentry ?
i 'm interested in a murder .

how could witwer have accessed the case file ?
can you fake the cerebral output ?
john . please . listen to me --
i 'm not getting halo 'd .
you ca n't run --

i 'm starving .
we 'll be back in an hour .
is n't that a fundamental paradox ?
why did you catch that ?
because it was going to fall .
you 're certain ?
yes .
to them .
cops are n't allowed inside the temple .
maybe you did n't hear me .
if it 's a question of authority .
the precogs are pattern recognition filters , nothing more .
but you call this room the `` temple '' .
just a nickname .
flaws .
it 's perfect .
you 'll confuse them !
she was looking right at me .
she spoke to me .
wally , listen to me ...
are these all of her previsions ?
just go to the beginning !
jesus , what 's up with your eye ?
for you , chief , i make housecalls ...
i need help with her .
rufus . she 's a precog .
she 's a precog ?
are you reading my mind right now ?
i need you to get it out .

the innocents we now use to stop the guilty .
and the murders were all happening .
precrime . the precogs . you .
a chain that will lead inexorably to his death .
so you wo n't help me ?
the system would collapse .
i believe in that system ...
i 'm not gon na kill anybody .
hold that thought .
why should i trust you ?
just find the minority report .
you said they 're destroyed .
what safe place is that ?
where ?
all you have to do is download it .
if ... you have one .
which one is that ?
john ?
he 's dead , lara .

lamar , i found something .

it 's the same prevision .
the ripples are going the other way .
i do n't understand --
he was concerned that you might find it .
danny , tell me what you 're thinking .
i 'm thinking someone got away with murder .
so there is a way to fool the system ?

it 's a thought i had .

i just got my license two weeks ago .

what do you mean ?
i think you know what i mean .

hmm .
hmm ? is that a professional opinion ?
maybe i can help you do that .
what would you do ?
but i need to see you a lot .
i barely made it today .
you 'll never feel you ca n't handle it .
i do n't want my dad paying .
are you always this sunny ?
you must bring it out .
'cause everyone agrees my immune system 's way down .
maybe you 'll catch it .
i 'm not making any promises .
we 'll turn back anytime you want .
is she against you getting help ?
we do n't discuss it .
something 's bothering her .
please ... forgive me .

i 've offended you !
no .

i 'm embarrassed . the list is so long .
be specific .
sore throat ?
forget fulness ... irritability ... depression ?
also ... i get confused .
it 's confusing here .
where ?
i do n't know if i mentioned the headaches .
but you get more now ? or more severe ?
i can give myself a headache instantly .
there ... i 've given myself a real whopper .
that was really bad , was n't it ?
disgusting .
and i 'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
so whose route is this ?
fourteen years old . lives next door .
and he 's where ?
you like it ?
it 's all right .
then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning .
and this is legitimate therapy ?
that 's what i like .
which thing ?
but it turned out i did n't .
my brother said you were about to fire me .
-- you 've been a tremendous help to me .
you 've made that possible for me .
that 's ... good ?
doctor . can i come in ?
is something wrong , sofie ?
yes , something 's very wrong , dr. mumford .
you 're upset .
do you know what i mean ?
i think so .
what was that ?
transference !
hello ?
i guess you saw the show ... ?
which show was that ?
sofie ...
we were watching `` er '' until someone called .
... how violated i feel ?
you feel violated ?
i am irate !
but ...
this is a terrible thing you 've done .
what ?
will you think about it ?
depends . i 'm in a bad mood .
anything ... just ask .
you got off easy .
will you wait for me ?
we 're only talking about six weeks .
will you be here ?
in maybe three or four issues .
weekly or monthly ?
what kind of deal is that ?
it 's called pro bono .
for whose good , supposedly ?
it 's my bit for the community .
it was very fascinating .
where was this ?
which we already knew ...
that is such a wicked look .
what do you want me to see ?
what happened today ?
what are you talking about ?
was it something that happened at school ?
these appointments were not my idea , remember .
do you think that 's what he wants ?
what 'd he say ?
what 're we ... ... going steady ? jesus .
no again ?
really ?
he agreed ?
you 're doc mumford . skip skipperton .
how are you ?
where 'd that come from ?
would you like another beer ?
nah ... scotch .
can i ask you a personal question ?
of course ! that 's exactly what i want .

it 's not ?
who else knows ?
damn ! what is your name ?
does n't matter . you can call me doc .
i 've told you a lot of private stuff .

my heart died a long time ago .
it is not dead . it is hiding .

she 's his mother , not yours .
and it would be the right thing to do .
have you ever seen him ?
how could i see him if he 's invisible ?
you sure that 's how you spell it ?
there 's just not enough of us .
there 's a big difference .
those guys are really starting to piss me off !
but there 's still only six of us .
so what else has superman got ?
this place is built like a fortress .
get mad !
your spiderman pez dispenser !
but she still might call !
are you coming or not ?
i 'll drive .
cover me !
there 's a vague similarity .
she 's getting suspicious , i know it .
so why do n't you just tell her !
i ca n't .
why not ?
and then they dump you .
so you 're chicken ?
maybe you should try a more romantic approach .
like what ? cutting off my own ear ?
or flowers .
let 's go .
i 'm soaked . oh great .
maybe she 's right .
agents ?
maybe there was traffic .
roy --
so where 's the art ?

i always knew that you were special .
hi .
she likes you .

and there 's the sphinx .
and a social life .
to us !

you should not make him work .
he takes good care of that .

ninotchka , or shall i say special envoy yakushova ...
let 's forget that we ever met .
as a representative of moscow ...
tonight let 's not represent anybody but ourselves .
if you wish to approach me ...
you know i want to ...
then do it through my lawyer !
i do n't like your following me .
i did n't follow you .
then how did you get here ?
i always eat here .
his memory is getting weak .
what are you after ?
must one always be after something ?
i beg you , sergeant ... smile !
what ?
will you smile ?
why ?
just smile .
at what ?
why ?
because we are an odd couple .
then you should go back to your table .
ha ! ha ! now go back .
on which boat ?
probably not .
do you like scotch stories ?
mcintosh ? `` ...
i wish they had never met .
i suppose you do n't think that 's funny ?
maybe it 's with you !
i do n't think so .
not funny , huh ?
no .
did you get that ?
i do n't look too foolish ?
you remember this room ?
you see ? life can be so simple .
for twelve francs , seventy-five .
then could we have some music ?
a wonderful idea ! radio or records ?
leon , i would like to ask you something .
i promise ... i swear .
did you make any change in this room ?
ninotchka , i love you .
how do you do ?
go on .
is that a good story ?
wonderful -- if one could believe it .
you must , darling .
it 's getting farther and farther away !
what , darling ?
thursday .
comrades ! comrades !
darling , darling ... please !
i must talk to my brothers !
shhh ! shhh !
but , darling , you ca n't do that .
comrades ! good people of france !
no speech ?
no speech .
i love you , my little leonitchka !
are we going to build our little house ?
yes ... a little white house .
not white , darling .
right : lovers of the world unite !
and we wo n't stretch up our arms ...
no ! no !
... and we wo n't clench our fist ...
no ! no !
our salute will be a kiss .
i want to confess , darling .
would that make you any happier ?
much happier .
now let 's have some music .
let 's turn on the radio .
what shall we get ? the news !
no music .
they belong to the people .
is this the wish of the masses ?
it is their wish .
can i make a speech now ?
yes , sweetheart .
hello , leon !
i had dinner with the guizots last night .
are you my little volga boatman ?
yes , i 'm your little volga boatman .
was i ? no ... not by a bolshevik !
you know him .
there must be some way of getting them back !
what does he say ?
leon ! what in heaven 's name ... !
huh ?
is anything wrong ? are you ill ?
make it ice cold .
you have n't seen her yet ?
i offered her seats for the opera ...
you just told me you had n't seen her .
what does she look like ?
you ca n't imagine .
that bad ? old or young ?
thank you .
is this your new dress suit ?
yes , swana , you did .
yes , swana .
am i interrupting ?
your highness , may i present madame yakushova ?
stop talking about the good old days .
have you ordered tea or a cocktail ?
no thanks , swana .
should i apologize ?
yes .
i 'm in love , swana .
how could you frighten me so ?
i 'm in love , swana .
leon ! this has the ugly sound of regeneration .
i 'm afraid that 's what it is .
by about five minutes .
has done what ?
she 's gone , leon .
hello , leon darling !
you made it very clear , madame .
good morning .
leon is not here .
in full possession of your faculties , at least .
we have nothing to discuss .
i have not reached that stage of civilization .
that 's all right ... i grow on people .
i must ask you to leave .
there 's a plane for moscow at five-forty .
madame , if you ...
i told you to go , madame .
where are they ?
but if you feel like notifying the police ...
you know that france has recognized the soviet .
unfortunately .
france is going to uphold that ownership .
you have calculated in terms of hunger .
ninotchka now realizes what she is after .
here , please ...
what do you want ?
may i have your bags , madame ?
good morning , comrade .
yes , it does .
you mean you have finished the whole investigation ?
may i ask why ?
cigarette ?
are you sure this report is correct ?
you want me to go to constantinople ?
i do n't understand .
please ... do n't make me go .
do your duty . good-by .
or a nice little corner table ?
now , what shall it be ?
raw carrots and beets .
i never think about food .
the future of the common people .
where to , madame ?
where do you eat ?
at père mathieu 's .
where is that ?
it 's just a place for workmen .
where is it ?
your highness .
how do you do , my friend .
your highness , forgive this intrusion , but ...
your jewels ! ... here in paris !
alexis ! do you know what you are saying ?
i am sorry ... i have to leave .
sir , if i may ... echo my concern ...
look ! this ? nixon ca n't say this .
you did say it , sir .
we could check the tape again , sir .
he should be here any minute .
i do n't want to be bugged .
how 's the job coming , bob ?
i 'm lucky helms lets me have a staff .
we 'll see about that ...
well , he certainly is n't acting like it .
he turns out to be ex-cia .
but they 're solid .
another hundred-and-thirty thousand .
executive clemency ...
what ?
mitchell ? mitchell 's ... family .
we could get that .
uh huh ...
is n't it ridiculous ?
what do we have to hide ?
no , we have nothing to hide .
it 's the presidency .
i understand that , sir .
i was sorry to hear about your wife .
i 'll bet he would .
the question is : why is he paying ?
to protect his people .
and it was through a plate-glass door .
he 's the one ...
who 's gon na tell mitchell ?
you do it .
why me ?
it 's a code or something .
i figured that out .
i think he means the kennedy assassination .
yeah ?
it 's got him shitting peach pits .
we failed him .
the whole suit of armor 'd fall off .
jesus ! did mitchell know ?
martha just put her head through a plate-glass window .
was he smoking pot ?
mitchell ?
i like it . i like the idea .
i mean has anyone ever done it before ?
where 's hunt now ?
he sent liddy to talk to me .
and ?
he wants money .
pay him .
it 's crazy to start ...
this is not a joke , john !
why not ?
that would cost us our strongest support .
we ca n't touch hoover --
the students started it , for christ 's sake !
he 's become the most hated man in america .
he wants to go overseas for awhile .
i would personally enjoy doing that , sir .
he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick .
what about england ?
the people , the press will go nuts .
this is june twentieth ?
sorry ...
he would 've protected the president .
mr. hoover was a realist .
it was that damn big mouth wife of his .
may i say something , mr. president ?
no , sir , you did not .
i do n't have a pistol .
more assassinations , more killings . right , al ?
they 'll go to the supreme court next .
i 'm not giving 'em my tapes !
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena ?
congress is considering four articles of impeachment , sir .
about a dozen .
who ?
cox ! fire him .
richardson wo n't do that . he 'll resign .
i never intended --
sir , the deadline is today .
the army ?
lincoln used it .
that was civil war .
you know ... that rusty , metallic smell ...
i know it well , sir .
it came over from vietnam , you know .
sir ?
there 's nothing there !
apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc .
we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy ...
you say he was involved in the plumbers ?
was he ... in the ellsberg thing ?
yes , you approved it , sir .
i did ?
they went in to get his psychiatric records .
fucking hell .
well , why not ?
but what are we paying him for ?
`` security '' is not strong enough .
even the designation is classified .
`` national security priority restricted and controlled secret . ''
or maybe chotiner ?
he 'll know what i 'm talking about .
all right .
how does that threaten us ?
that 's why i appointed him .
it 's national security .
how is this national security ?
i have too much to do .
the odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
meanwhile , what happens to the country ?
herb covered it for you .
he was putting me on notice .
hoover knew a lot of gangsters .
i do n't understand . track 2 's chile ?
before ? ! eisenhower approved that ?
jesus !
or the cubans .
let richard helms take the fall ?
... he 'd just found out about track 2 .
you never told him ?
the pr is going to murder us .
money . follow the money .
sir ?
... never complain , never explain , john ...
why 're we stopping ?
not like these mudmutts .
a nineteen-year-old college kid ...
sir ?
i believe you 're right , boss .
... but even the presidency is n't enough anymore ...
sir ?
the madman theory was n't so crazy after all .
he talked to the new york times ?
because they 're not americans .
they do n't trust america !
it 's helms -- it 's got to be .
we could leverage helms .
how ?
what about the documents he promised ?
i promised iran to townsend .
put townsend in belgium ; it 's available .
more light , chief ?
richard ... come with me , would you ...
i promise . i promise ... please , mama ...
never . i promise .
we have n't said grace yet . richard .
i ca n't ...
!
god has chosen thee to survive ...
what 'd he say ?
he said in life there 's no free ride .
what 'd you say ?
what ... ?
mom expects great things from you ...
my friends call me `` mister president . ''
you could do the same ...
your agency is secure .
you 're doing a magnificent job .
though it does raise a disturbing issue .
what ?
mr. castro .
and it is certainly not cia policy .
cuba would be a small price to pay .
do you ever think of death , mr. helms ?
do you appreciate flowers ?
`` the second coming '' ?
no .
a nuclear attack ?
i want to see him tomorrow , clyde .
he works in the kitchen .
... little bobby .
ummm ...
oh , it was n't a big house ...
thank you for coming , dick .
oh , my goodness ...
how about you ? are you going to win ?
i 've got the police chiefs in san diego .
roselli ? johnny roselli ?
yes . your old friend from cuba .
i never met the man .
you 'll win the nomination .
we took his system out .
it still is .
kissinger himself , i believe , maybe the leaker .
kissinger ?
i always get my man .
how the fuck did you know ?
seen the guys ?
why , you got a customer ?
the white house .
you 're fucking me .
we 're gon na plug a leak .
who we working for ?
so , does tricky dick know about this ?
what 're you doing ?
you sure throw a helluva party .
she 's quite pretty .
that would 've done it in '60 .
only if kennedy dumps johnson .
so , what 's this about , dick ?
if we 'd won in vietnam ...
!
are you threatening me , dick ?
it 's your fault , henry .
... as the old alliances crumble .
what do you think ?
that 's triangular diplomacy , gentlemen .
i , nixon , was born to do this .
i ... i heard something ... it sounded idiotic .
i have never made a dime from public service ...
as some kind of ... of ... crooks ?
and i will tell the world why .
you have many friends ... and admirers ...
you know ... believe in a supreme being ?
you mean on my knees ?
uh , i hope this does n't embarrass you .
i want to know your secret .
secret , mr. chairman ?
what can i get you ?
just ... uh ... you know .
do you miss cuba , manolo ?
yes , mr. president .
your people .
that was mr. kennedy .
he was a politician .
did you cry when he died ?
yes .
why ?
he made me see the stars ...
in your case , millions of vietnamese .
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war .
he 's on the top of the list .
how about kissinger along with him ?
it 's the lie that gets you .
sorry , dick . she 's a little tipsy .
pat ca n't stand her .
she talks at night .
you never crack .
how many ?
two boys . two girls . and eight wounded .
they 'll never buy it .
tuberculosis got him .
they panicked .
it broke my heart when harold died .
... give me a break , mary .
but it was all we had .
clyde ... hi .
... use his women .
hi , i 'm dick nixon .
you 're shittin ' me .
where you from ?
syracuse .
the one with the blood disease ...
ernie davis .
it 's a civil war between the vietnamese .
hi .
do you like blue ... red ?
i like jazz ...
yeah ... guy lombardo ...
elvis i like , too .
uh , is your mother ... still alive ?
yeah , she lives in dallas ...
we came here to end the war .
why ? what good was his death ?
or even what i want ...
we got the press this time !
bernstein .
you know , fred , they sell tickets .
sir ?
gandhi , lenin ...
that 's right .
what 's in there ?
pows . and their families .
so i 'm supposed to be ...
compassionate . grateful .
proud ?
sir ?
of them .
yes , yes .
do you think those pows in there did ?
nixon ca n't say this . `` niggers '' !
we lost ...
i know ...
it makes us human ...
we earned it . it 's ours .
he was a failure , too .
amen to that .
it 's over , dick .
i 'll concede in the morning .
what are you talking about ?
i want a divorce .
my god -- divorce ? what about the girls ?
they only know you from television anyway .
it would ruin us , buddy , our family .
this is our life .
and you 're political , too !
i 'll do it . no more .
are you serious ?
yeah ... i 'm out .
is that the truth ?
dick , you should call bobby .
he does n't want me at the funeral .
you do n't have to go .
and adenauer . nixon ca n't not be there .
i 'm sure it was an oversight .
him and teddy . they always hated me .
were you planning to tell me ?
new hampshire ...
they need you , too .
i do n't want them to love me .
do you really want this , dick ?
this . above all .
yes ... i will . yeah !
then i 'll be there for you .
i love you , buddy .
can i just ask for one thing ?
anything .
what are you doing in here ?
i 've missed you .
just the two of us .
yeah , sure , a long time ago .
i 'm not jack kennedy .
why ca n't you just enjoy it ?
i do . in my own way .
then what are you scared of , honey ?
they 're all your enemies ?
yes !
you personally ?
it 's not pretty .
sometimes i think that 's what you want .
i 'm not jack ...
penny for your thoughts .
only nixon could 've done that .
yes .
when ?
tomorrow .
what exactly did you want to discuss , pat ?
you . what ' you 're doing --
and what am i doing ?
i wish i knew . you 're hiding .
hiding what ?
if you do n't talk to me , you ...
i 'm finished trying .
thank you .
or just me and you and ...
do n't be ridiculous !
they were for me . they 're mine .
it 'll be over soon .
if i could just ... sleep .
dick nixon ... you remember him .
well , you 're obviously making him happy .
how 's the lawyer life ?
won or lost ?

loretta says you 're quittin ' .
yes , you 've circled round .
how come 're you doin that ?
you do n't know what he thinks .
as they say .
when did he die ?
most do n't .
you 're discouraged .
i 'm ... discouraged .
i thought maybe she was with your boy there .
no id in her room ?
no money in his room there ?
those hombres would 've taken the stash .
though they was leavin ' in a hurry .
what is it leading to ?
it is not the one thing .
try `` old '' on for size .
none of that explains your man though .
i 'm not sure he 's a lunatic .
well what would you call him .
sometimes i think he 's pretty much a ghost .
he 's real all right .
oh yes .
it 's beyond everything .
yes , he has some hard bark on him .
hard to believe .
you ai n't heard from him ?
no i ai n't .

colonel tarleton , you deal with these damned rebels .

it is superseded by duty .
you have a letter inside .

he seeks a levy of troops and money .
do you intend to enlist without my permission ?

he left us .
some are just to you .
i do n't care . i hate him .

i 'll wait for lord cornwallis .

but father , they might come this way .
father ?
father , you ca n't let them take him ...
but where are we going , mr. crandall ?
bite ?
do you know what a graveyard really is ?
they do it to honor the dead , ellen .
i know you loved y'brother , but --
it 's gorgeous !
yes , but the rope might be --
can i fly it now , mommy !
paxcow says it 's almost too late !
ellie ... ellie ... what ...
he --
is he like the boogeyman ?
please hurry .
yes .
no-i guess not .
have you got a death-wish , ellen ?
good god ! where 'd you hear that ?
is he really all right ?
yes .
because you promised .
i 'll cough up the money , ellen .
ever since mrs. rogers called and said missy --
ellie ? what 's wrong ?
no more chocolate chip cookies .
some think we 're born again as little children --
do you think my chair will be here tomorrow ?
yeah , sure .
i 'm not tired !
i 'm sure you 're not .
she needs you .
do you swear ?
jud crandall . i live just across the road .
it 's nice to meet you .
built and maintained by broken- hearted children !
was it pascow ?
hey -- they actually found the place !
you need a glass ?
not at all .
god , that 's fine .
what were you listening to ?
allman brothers .
what ?
nice .
you folks ready to go on ?
who owns the woods up ahead ? paper companies ?
not yet ... how much further is it ?
ai n't that so , louis ?
as you may have noticed .
i think it might be your daughter 's .
it 's church .
at least it do n't look like he suffered .
loved that cat pretty well , did n't she ?
bagged cat . what a mess .
going to tell ellie ?
but --
does she love the cat ?
yes , but --
what say , louis ?
we 'll break our necks !
i 'm not climbing that .
yes . where are we going , jud ?
micmacs used to call it little god swamp .
is there quicksand ?
it 's funny , all right .
almost there , louis .
you keep saying that .
this was their burying ground , louis .
whose burying ground ?
i brought you here to bury ellen 's cat .
why ? for god 's sake , why ?
we 'll talk later . all right ?
i guess so ... but ...
you want to rest a bit before you start ?
the soil looks thin .
what are those for ?
does n't look like they last long .
do n't worry about that .
jud , why am i doing all this ?
but --
but ...
would n't wash ?
it was that place , was n't it ?
can i have another one ?
they said a wendigo had soured the ground .
wendigo ?
yes .
why , then , things should be fine .
what ?
rachel not feeling well ?
out of the mouths of babes , louis .
ayuh ... how is your cat , louis ?
it 's ellie 's cat .
her and ellie .
shit ! look at this mess !
that 's why they moved on .
because something called a wendigo soured the ground .
i --
remember , doc .
leave me alone !
the barrier must not be crossed .
let her go . it 's cool .
and buckaroo banzai .
gage 's gone !
thank you . thank you so much .
the movers --
this path , louis ? where does it go ?
my god !
i think it 's rather extraordinary .
she 's finally asleep .
poor kid .
that 's enough of that kind of talk !
i just said --
go and wash your face .
well , honey ... you know that ...
thank you , louis .
getting there .
i got eggs down here !
i heard you tonight .
that 's forgotten .
it 's just that i..you know .
i 'm going to try to do better .
louis , are you sure ?
you stole my boat .
the jolly mon . where is it ?
at port royal . with the royal navy .
that boat is my livelihood !
you 'll get it back . or one better .
how does he do that ?
anamaria , trim the mainsail !
what 's in your head , boy ?
enough of that ! name your terms .
elizabeth goes free !
we got that part . anything else ?
you must swear by the holy bible .
say the name , or i slit your throat .
allow me the humor of listening to your terms .
you have something i want -- more than anything .
and just how do you expect this to work ?
that 's right .
blast you ! i 'll throw you in prison .
what would you do ?
what -- you do n't have the medallion ?
i 'll watch my back .
no good can come of it .
you can go to your grave not knowing .
no , i really think i do .
why do n't i want to do this ?
the situation has changed .
that so ?
there 's ... another exit ?
a mortal fool .
now ?
looks like your back to having nothing to offer .
best play it safe , and spill it all .
do you believe him ?
what is it you want ?
means 'no . '
i 'll drop it !
that bit of shine matters to me ... why ?
you have a name , missy ?
you 've got sand , for a maid .
a family heirloom , perhaps ?
can i trust you ?
maid or not , it fits you .
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner ?
then why are n't you eating ?
do you not know what this is , then ?
the curse drove you to gather this ?
man overboard !
boy overboard !
you have become a fine woman , elizabeth .
i ca n't breathe .
and behind his back this time .
commodore , you ca n't do that !
no . the pirates have taken will --
but so was his decision to engage in piracy .
elizabeth , i hereby withdraw my proposal .
what ?
then i can wear men 's clothing .
actually , i find it all fascinating .
is everything all right ? are you decent ?
ceremony ?
elizabeth , this is hardly appropriate --
what ?
i 'm glad we got here in time .
why would my father send this to me ?
if i had known --
it does n't !
miss swann .
you ? !
me !
you 're in league with barbossa !
come on !
how will this help us get off the island ?
you spent three days on the beach drinking rum ?
we 've got to do something to help him !
drink up me hearties , yo ho ...
something funny , miss swann ? share , please .
let 's hear it .
that was before i met one , of course .
and the scenery has definitely improved .
to freedom .
you did n't tell commodore norrington everything .
first -- have you found me a crew ?
say again ?
all i need is a crew .
a fool 's errand .
something he needs .
we 'd best drop canvas , sir !
blast it , i 'm already awake !
what ? he never told me that .
there 'll be torture as well .
we 're not going to just surrender !
sir ! shall i break out the cannons ?
you 'll never make it out of the bay .
this dock is off-limits to civilians .
what 's your name ?
but it seems to be enough to condemn him .
i will not put my men at a disadvantage .
you would do that ?
crossing blades with a pirate ?
you threatened miss swann .
who makes all these ?
at least three hours a day .
you cheated .
move away .
no .
move !
the black pearl ?
somewhat .
where does it make berth ?
where is it ?
why ask me ?
because you 're a pirate .
and you want to turn pirate yourself ?
never . they took miss swann .
i can get you out of here .
how ? the key 's run off .
agreed .
not without my effects .
why are brothering with that ?
i 'd die for her .
it 's been a sound policy .
that ship ?
nautical term .
it 's still against the law .
this is either crazy , or brilliant .
we 're taking over the ship !
is that so ?
'bootstrap ? '
that 's not true .
i swear , you look just like him .
it 's not true my father was a pirate .
figured you would n't want to hear it .
sure -- because he could always go pirating .
it 's not worth getting beat again .
tortuga ?
just do it quickly .
shut up , before you lose them all !
wait -- what about the pistol ?
my mutinous first mate --
what 's that ?
depends .
on what ?
it 's going badly !
no .
i 'll keep 'em busy .
do you have any idea where you 're going ?
jack !
are you certain this is the right way ?
what kind of pirate is that ?
the black pearl is a real ship .
no , it 's not .
yes it is . i 've seen it .
you 've seen it ?
yes .
you 've seen the black pearl ?
yes .
you have n't seen it .
... no .
no .
is that what you 're saying ?
smith ' ?
i think he 's telling the truth .
he 's not telling the truth .
mentioned it , is more what he did .
he 's still breathing .
what happened here ?
has my daughter given you an answer yet ?
commodore --
a moment .
but --
how long do you leave him in there ?
right , mr. sim ?
speak .
have you found dr . bright ?
wheelchair accessible .
i believe she is hiding something of ours there .
you ca n't mean that .
something to drink , dr . bright ?
do n't you agree , susan ?
pollution ?
what are you going to do to him ?
... plastic .
how apropos .
i know what you 're doing .
i made you plastic ! i made you !
like rotting meat .
it will be ready soon .
it 's ready now , i know it is .
she says it 's not .
she lost the first one on purpose .
icky ! what 's happening ?
bright .
we 'll get her assistant . what's-his-name ? nebbishman ?
do you think she will give us the designs ?
these things are always a matter of leverage .
and you think o'brien is that leverage ?
do you think she loves him ?
i would do anything for you .
why are there two ottomans ?
is that still true ?
yes . yes , of course it is .
can you feel the weight of its significance ?
it will be an ascension .
i was wondering if you 'd finished considering ?
considering what ?
poppy , please --
if you loved me like i loved you ?
did you feel that ?
i 've been waiting for that for years .
simple really . no problem .
that might work .
where did he go ?
they 're here ! we have the nanobot .
you have outdone yourself .
hey !
you do n't want this .
why do n't you give it a try ?
yeah ? so what ?
for starters , how about littering is a crime .
you 've got to learn to take responsibility !
make me throw it out ?
i was just thinking ...
aaabout ... ?
a man ?
i knew him when i was still in school .
what did he want ?
as the bonding element .
it was one man .
what did security say ?
they 'll in validate the key . probably nothing .
well , you got another problem .
the replicators ?
she 's waiting in the lab .
what are you going to do ?
you were never invited to my house .
do you understand that ?
dr. argon would say we are all prisoners .
how can that not affect you ?
they focus on what can be gained .
is that what argon told you ?
you 're afraid of him .
yes ?
it 's sim . we 're almost there .
what 's it smell like ?
smell ? uh , something like methylcyanoacrylate .
like crazy glue ?
sir , please try to hold still .
susan !
daniel ...
when did you ... ?
been out for six months now .
really ? what have you been doing ?
somebody has to .
same old daniel .
is that so ?
the big house does things to a man .
the big house ?
the big house .
and for cleaning up oil spills .
nothing really worthwhile .
it 's really wonderful .
yeah , we 'll see .
if you 're gon na flip your wig --
you 're insane .
daniel , give him the trix .
susie ! you got ta help me !
daniel , what are you doing here ?
they did it to me !
... just like the mouse .
mouse ? what mouse ?
my first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse .
what happened to it ?
a plastic man ? !
daniel !
we do n't have time for hysterics .
what are these ?
help you go to the bathroom .
why ?
got it .
the problem is the by-product created by the process .
that was an egg ?
three days ago it was .
that 's right .
allergies ? infections ?
is something wrong ?
susan !
look at this !
it 's got to mean something .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
just giving credit where credit is due .
you have no one to blame but yourself .
blame the victim .
just like old times .
a bit out of control .
probably the caffeine .
do you have something to bring me down ?
uh oh . i remember that temper .
what 's wrong ?
the nanobot ... it 's not here ...
how far can you stretch ?
what did you want my hair for ?
i 'll bring you back a pizza .
no cheese .
that 's pretty good .
that 's going to fit me ?
you made this out of my hair ?
did you go ?
who is he ?
i got ta get out of here .
you 're here ! oh thank god .
you did n't think i could just leave you ?
we have to get the nanobot !
where is it ?
argon 's private lab .
run , daniel ! get out of here !
you saved my life .
susie ... i ...
what in the ... ?
it 's spread to the tower .
we 've got to get the nanobot .
it 's too late . argon injected it .
that means the nanobot is still inside him .
we 'll find another way to stop the waste .
you 're not going after argon !
do you remember that ?
i remember i was trying to help ...
god , what a fight that was .
we were different people then .
things do change .
you ! i remember you !
what ? i 'm not going anywhere !
oh yes you are !
now let 's go !
yeah , and what might that be ?
all the different ways that i could kill you .
that 's impossible .
mrs. argon ? it 's sim .
do you have him ? he 's alive ?
oh yeah , he 's alive . technically .
and you have him ?
vermin ...
knew what was in my basement --
i could have you fired right now .
icky !
what in the hell ?
yes , it 'll be a very interesting experiment .
to make a gentleman out of a tramp ?
indeed ? how interesting .
goodbye , mrs. smith .
goodbye , miss gallagher .
i think i better go , stew .
do n't mind mother .
may i use your telephone ?
certainly . right over there .
that 's considerate of you .
i recommend you read it .
bobo is so lonely !
and you do n't know who babykins is .
i suppose you 're going to print them ?
it 's quite obvious .
will you step into the library ?
will - uh - five thousand be enough ?
for what ?
here .
you 're a bit eccentric , are n't you ?
only one thing wrong with me
oh , mother !
it 's all right .
stewart and i are married .
he 's all right . i like him .
egg marks the spot
you ought to get some new ties , stewart .
your place ?
would that be room enough for us ?
of course i am stewart .
you have the cutest nose i've
do you like them ?
you wear them of course , silly .
i have n't worn these things for years .
i know that .
oh no , i wo n't wear garters
this is gallagher .
gallagher !
how do you do ?
that 's funny . is n't it funny ?
i thought i was very charming , stewart .
did you really say it ?
where 's your valet ?
i 'm not going !
what am i going downstairs and tell those people ?
anne , come here . listen
look out for my lipstick , stewart .
let 's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
how 's that ?
would you like that ?
but i
oh hello , anne he types furiously .
i see .
are n't you being a little unreasonable ?
your house ?
no more ! so that 's that .
that 's ridiculous .
you 're acting like a child .
i found that out a long time ago .
it 's a great place to save a face .
that 's an excellent idea .
what is this person doing here ?
what does it say about the reception last night ?
i told you not to worry about him .
ah-ah-ah !
mother !
he deserved it .
hello , there , meadows ! [ 13 ]
who is it you wish to see , sir ?
oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith .
we are having a reception here this evening
you 're the tribune man ?
fine . have a seat .
this way .
fine newspaper the tribune .
well , i should say !
i knew your managing editor very well .
is that so ?
yale '21 , i believe .
huh ?
i 'm a stock-holder , you know .
is that so ?
but there 's no truth in the story whatsoever .
so , you see how silly that rumor is ?
give my regards to your managing editor .
you can rewrite it for your last edition .
oh , is that so ?
impossible . put it on again .
what do you want ?
how 's that ?
`` just a gigolo . . . ``
i bring a message from garcia .
yeah ?
yeah - go on .
a hundred and fifty bucks a week .
i 'll bite . what 's the catch ?
is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana ?
a great story - wish i 'd printed it .
look , i quit !
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah ?
just to sort of break the monotony ?
gloria golden ?
yeah , little gloria .
got her hooks into the schuyler kid , eh ?
right - for the first time this year .
well - it 's only april .
come on , get going , get going !
any of them - but get it .
all right . give me a voucher for expenses .
not on my own beat , no .
or are you ?
yes , sir .
well , when are you quitting ?
mr . schuyler .
is that so ?
just a boid in a gilded cage -
a what ?
how do you like that ?
what play ?
my play .
the one about the siberian bloodhound ?
it 's laid in araby now .
araby ?
sure .
i 'm not quitting !
no ?
how do you like your bath , sir ?
who are you ?
dawson is the name , sir .
you 're my what ?
dawson , sir .
was i very drunk last night ?
did you take anything out of those pants ?
oh no , sir !
you 'd make a good wife .
thank you , sir .
quite so . quite .
all right , outside !
i beg your pardon , sir ?
you mean you want me to go ?
that 's a canary , sir .
get that out of here !
yes , sir . very good , sir .
get that thing out of here !
well , what would you like to have ?
that 's the usual thing , is n't it ?
that 's a lovely dress .
thank you . where is mr. smith ?
oh , you mean ann schuyler 's husband ?
yes .
you 've been drinking again .
the boss is getting hoarse .
she 's it
and that
i would n't call her a brewery horse .
gallagher ! she 's the real mccoy !
and the rest of us are truck horses ?
there you go , talking like a woman !
what did you run away for ?
are n't you going to congratulate a guy ?
thanks , thanks .
what 's the matter with your eyes ?
it 's the smoke .
i want you to meet her .
sure , anne would love that .
remember , she 's a schuyler .
that 's the name .
and if your social duties permit - why -
he does n't know what he 's talking about .
do n't you think i 'm lucky , gallagher ?
sure - i think so , stew .
a bird in a gilded cage , eh ?
how is her family going to feel about it ?
let 's get a look at you .
well , i 'll have to look someplace else .
what are you doing to yourself ?
nothing .
and where did you get that dress ?
i dyed one and washed the other .
staring at us ?
my mistake - she 's glaring .
well , gallagher ! glad to see you .
hello , stew .
i asked hank , and hank did the rest .
how 's that ?
okay .
stewart , have you ever been to old madrid ?
been where ?
to old madrid .
never even been to new madrid .
then how do you expect to write about it ?
oh - draw on my imagination , i suppose .
did who ?
conrad .
that 's an idea there . i wonder now ...
what could i be ?
pal , get me a cigarette , will you ?
here you are .
she 'll see it your way .
hey , gallagher !
yeah ?
it 'll be ready in a minute .
sorry , boss
who was that ?
grayson - anne 's lawyer .
what 's michael tearing the paper about ?
since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor ?
a statement ? good .
i have it here .
the man from the tribune seemed perfectly satisfied .
i think you 'd better go .
you quit trying to stop anybody
well , at best you might deny it .
traps shut !
hello , smith .
holy jumping swordfish !
surely , come right in .
thanks . may i sit down ?
i do n't eat waffles .
she did ?
i beg your pardon .
we just thought that
yes .
okay - you remember joe
you do n't mind , do you ?
come in , joe . it 's all right .
some bicarbonate - quick !
double-strength !
are the cars ready ?
smythe , you 've been drinking .
what would you say , mrs. schuyler ?
perhaps he will do me a great favor .
with pleasure , madame !
do what about what ?
about what ? your marriage to anne !
stop calling me mother !
all right , grandma
have you seen this ?
yes - the worm !
who is this woman ?
joan of arc ! what 's it to you ?
there are no gentlemen on the tribune .
your name is jeeves , is n't it ?
the name is smythe .
shake ! now , as a smith to a smythe
mrs. schuyler is not at home .
but i
well done , sir . very neat .
smythe , the - er - gentleman is leaving .
did you call , sir ?
shhh ! do you hear something ?
yes , sir .

me , sir ?

no .
i 'm sorry that did n't work out .
-- and the listless ones do the binding .
we ought n't be reading his nasty stories --
he 's a writer , not a madman .
at your service , count .
madeleine --
do n't say that ; reading 's my salvation .
each strumpet , each murderess .
do n't turn us out , abbe .
but my heart 's held fast here ...
by whom ? the marquis ?
why not ?
go back to your room . quickly .
free his mouth .
must n't do that , sir .
care for a splash of wine , abbe ?
bribe one of the guards ?
for curative purposes , to stave off my madness --
behind my back , without my sanction !
enough to discern its tenor .
and -- ?
there i was taxed ; it 's true .
why not put that in your books as well ?
it 's a fiction , not a moral treatise .
the ministry has threatened us with closure .
they ca n't be serious .
our future lies in the stroke of your pen .
mightier than the sword indeed .
no manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
if you only mean to dupe me again --
he ca n't do that to me .
i 've no company but the characters i create --
i have a proposition .
you always do .
that 's enough .
you could use a long , slow screw .
good day , marquis .
am i to freeze to death ?
an entire religion , built on an oxymoron !
-- water ! --
why this sudden torture ?
i only record it !
nothing but your own morbid gratification --
what on earth would that require ?
a night spent with the partner of my choice .
you expect me to pimp madeleine ?
off with your clothes !
coulmier , you animal !
i do not mean to flirt , marquis !
sex without flirtation is merely rape !
power over another man .
your words drove bouchon to --
would you condemn the bible ? i think not !
i saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
do n't confuse one organ with another --
i know , because i felt it myself --
i wanted to fuck her , that 's all !
and did you ?
you courted . you begged .
go to hell !
why was it you never took her by force ?
who 's to say i did not ?
was it impotence ?
never !
and all the while , she plead for more --
which one of us will bleed ?
abbe de coulmier !
i 'm here .
surely you 'll grant me a final word .
of course .
not to mention its therapeutic value .
his wife 's influence .
and he 's never once attempted escape ?
oh . that .
do you favor its publication ?
but he 's one among some two hundred wards --
maybe you should flog him at the stake ?
you 're a sentimental man .
and place my reputation at stake ?
and -- ?
but if you truly have matters in hand here --
it was fiction , of course .
of course .
it was not inspired by circumstance .
exploiting those drooling , pathetic cretins for financial gain --
i 'll do everything in my power --
this child let loose the beast from its cage --
my , my . you have exceeded my expectations .
and my own .
how is the patient faring ?
poorly .
i will not be the last .
will you sleep soundly tonight ?
but i am history .
i 'll be waiting .
you asked my name once ; it 's madeleine .
my scepter awaits ; how solid it grows !
let 's try it dorsal !
it 's not your cup of tea , mama .
yes ?
i 'm hungry for a proper visit .
do n't start --
did i frighten you ?
the peril of composing such incendiary prose ...
is it awfully violent ?
most assuredly .
is it terribly erotic ?
the story 's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium .
surely you 've seen a man naked .
a final volley from us both !
-- who 'll whisper it to bouchon --
yes ! you shall . of course you shall --
... yes , i 've got that bit ...
`` ... your wife . ''
your every waking moment is governed by the insane .
i pray you : be succinct .
it 's tainted money , doctor .
what a beautiful thought , marquise .
oh , but i am !
-- words alone are insufficient .
do n't toy with me , doctor .
i am eternally in your debt .
this is neither the time nor the place --
i 'll have you removed --
trust me . i 'm a woman who knows .
it 's libelous ; you would n't dare .
hm ? tell me . what other treats ?
perhaps a pot of ink ?
how was i to know , my darling ?
you 've come to lecture me ?
never ! sought audience with the emperor --
leave at once --
but it 's just begun --
does n't that please you ?
i 'd rather read , thank-you .
ever met walter winchell ?
no , when i was but a tender lad --
so you ever gon na do a picture ?
not you too
you 're gon na do great .
i wonder sometimes .
you 're just scared .
of being found out . of not being a genius
sling the bullshit elsewhere .
god , these parties are the worst
stay with us for a while .
mr. welles certainly is a caution
real deep down .
and attractive in a hammy sort of way .
just tell the old man that --
i can't
sure you can , just --
and he was going to make me a star .
that oughta be enough .
yeah . but all of a sudden it 's not
about pops and everything ?
marion , everyone knows you 're not like that --
who are you , sir ?
my name is orson welles
the actor
and director .
and you are in california for what reason ?
it is a treacherous business .
do you have any idea what you have done ?
do you ?
i learned at the knee of the master .
louis
randolph !
have you heard about this citizen kane picture ?
not a very good picture i am told .
do you follow so far ?
you know that ca n't happen .
oh , why is that ?
why is that , louis ?
i got ta have some kinda life !
there 's no call for that language-
i ca n't see it myself --
there . that 's right .
divorce is a very serious sin , apparently .
how bad is it ?
nothing for you to worry about , darling
how much ?
it 's not really --
we 're 125 million dollars in debt ?
how does one get 125 million dollars in debt ?
a forced laugh
the crazy old man and his whore .
marion --
well at least in the movie he married her !
this picture --
then you explain it to me ? !
!
i will not defend my life to you --
you got ta wake up now . pops .
now you better face up to it --
i need the tribune to --
how much did that cost ?
from deauville -- in france .
i know where deauville is for c-c-christ 's sake .
you need n't use that language with me
did you need any of it ?
i wanted it
there 's a different between want and
not for me .
you 've captured me exactly . goodnight .
you will not walk out on me
you are repellant when you drink .
fuck you , mr. kane .
i will not have this in my home .
i just want to understand --
and ... marion .
and ...
yes ?
thank you for your time
sir ?
why did we not know about this sooner ?
sir , i-
i want blood
keep filming .
i ca n't remember the lines !
look right at the monster and you tell him --

i 'll bet it 's been done .
for instance ?
his wife took a trip .
she -- was -- an -- invalid !
i 've got to run , jeff .
no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity .
thanks .
i 'll see if i can find out where .
by the way what happened to your leg ?
i think they missed their chance with her .
she never left the apartment --
then where is she -- in the ice box ?
-- until yesterday morning .
what time ?
feel a little foolish ?
who said they left then ?
who left -- where ?
the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station .
`` ?
have you checked his bank deposits lately ?
jeff -- huh ?
if possible -- both .
it must be knee-deep in evidence .
he must ask for evidence .
give him evidence .
mrs. thorwald 's in it !
but i 'm not a killer !
that depends on who `` they '' were .
jefferies .
listen to me ! lisa 's been arrested .
your lisa ?
i told you that --
like what ?
a possibility .
something a dog could scent .
you think perhaps it was `` old hambone ? ''
where 'd they take lisa ?
i sent a friend over with bail money .
jefferies .
congratulations , jeff .
for what ?
for getting rid of that cast .
wrong day ?
next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon .

readers ' digest , april , 1939 .
i predicted it .
absolutely none .
right now i 'd even welcome trouble .
you 've got a hormone deficiency .
i knew it !
do n't you ever heat that stuff up .
what kind of trouble ?
lisa fremont .
she expects me to marry her .
that 's normal .
i do n't want to .
that 's abnormal .
i 'm not ready for marriage .
what is it ? you have a fight ?
no .
her father loading up the shotgun ?
stella !
she 's just not the girl for me .
she 's only perfect .
you 're never going to marry ?
let her look for somebody else .
you 're too good for me ! ''
there 's an intelligent way to approach marriage .
we 've progressed emotionally in --
people have different emotional levels that --
and we 've loved every minute of it .
marry her .
how did you know !
must have been staring out the window for hours .
alone .
poor girl . someday she 'll find her happiness .
well , the salesman could be available soon .
he and his wife splitting up ?
house numbers that light up .
what about this morning ? any developments ?
the shades are still drawn in their apartment .
a federal offense .
i 've been looked at before .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
police ?
huh ?
you called the police ?
mrs. thorwald ?
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around ?
if he ever --
thank heaven that 's over !
i wonder .
and she 's reading the bible .
what are you two talking about ?
got a shovel ?
no .
there 's probably one in the basement .
why does n't she turn him in ?
smart girl .
what do you need money for ?
one hundred and twenty-seven .
how much do you think you 'll need ?
ten here .
thirty-three here . totals one-ninety . not enough .
hello .
mrs. doyle ?
yes .
jeff again . has tom come in yet ?
not yet , jeff .
you have n't even heard from him ?
it is something really important , jeff ?
i think thorwald 's pulling out tonight .
who 's thorwald ?
it 's a man .
goodnight , you idiot .
how 's your leg ?
mmmm -- hurts a little .
and your stomach ?
empty as a football .
and you love life ?
not too active .
anything else bothering you ?
-- a steal at eleven hundred dollars .
something big going on somewhere ?
it 's a big night .
big enough ?
what a day i 've had !
tired ?
then i had to dash back and change .
tell me -- what was slim hayward wearing ?
you ca n't buy that kind of publicity .
you could pick your assignment .
i wish there was one i wanted .
make the one you want .
you mean leave the magazine ?
yes .
for what ?
do n't laugh . -- i could do it !
lives alone . probably had an unhappy marriage .
it 's just that --
did you ever eat fish heads and rice ?
not quite -- it seems . goodbye , jeff .
you mean `` goodnight . ''
do n't you ever have any problems ?
i have one now .
so do i .
and come back three times ?
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home .
and why did n't he go to work today ?
i would n't dare answer that .
what do you think ?
jeff -- if you could only see yourself .
you 'd better before you catch the disease !
does that make me sound like a madman ?
what makes you think something 's wrong with her ?
maybe she died .
where 's the doctor -- the undertakers ?
lisa , please !
acting nonchalant .
no comment .
do n't you see how silly you 're being ?
what 's the apartment house number ?
okay , chief . what 's my next assignment .
to get on home .
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
what about it ?
he was asking somebody advice over the phone .
someone not his wife ?
i wonder where he 's going now ?
i do n't know .
suppose he does n't come back again ?
something on your mind , lisa ?
it does n't make sense to me .
what does n't ?
do they hide it in their husband 's clothes ?
inside stuff ?
he does n't sound like much of a detective .
i wish he 'd get there , though .
we have all -- what ?
night . i 'm going to stay with you .
that 's a suitcase ?
from his landlord -- once a month .
i wish i could be creative .
you have a talent for creating difficult situations .
i do ?
the same .
but he never ends up marrying her . strange .
why do n't i slip into something comfortable ?
i hate funny exit lines .
i 'm not much on rear window ethics .
i 'll rephrase the question .
is he cleaning house ?
was n't that close ?
what for ?
how ?
i do n't take any of the chances .
second floor rear . make it fast .

no --
nobody arrested him !
i think i should go home .
what time is it ?

she could identify us too .

so then you moved ?
just move and everything 'll be roses and sunshine .
things pretty tough for you at home ?
what a zoo !
what ?
pretty mixed up ?
if he could --
how can anyone grow up in this circus ?
it 's easier sometimes than talking to your folks .

you do n't need to do that .
there 's something i should tell you , judy .
we do n't have to pretend now .

i only took a bite .
only three million dollars a month !
plato , where 's your father now ?

where 'd they go ?
i guess i lost my head .
i did n't have them to aim .

you 've been sorta close mouthed about him .
you went to mexico lookin ' for cattle .
went off down to mexico or something ...
only he did n't . lednov killed him .
oh ... that 's the time you went away .
maybe you shoulda killed him .
looks pretty peaceful up ahead .

they do n't bother anybody .

i did n't stop to think , clay .
i 'll eat when i 'm good and ready .

i do n't care what she asked you .
half of them are mine .
is that the only reason you came back ?

how 's that ?
kind of sore .
we were afraid those killers might come back .
yeah , how did you know ?
i did n't know who she was .
all right , you did n't know .
i ca n't take her with me .
you 're not bein ' quite fair .
i did n't know you had a daughter .
all right , you did n't know .
i ca n't take her with me .
you 're not bein ' quite fair .

i said i did n't care .
i wo n't tell anybody ! go away !

she must n't -- do n't you let her --
you got no business snoopin ' around --
that something i should n't see ?
what is it ?
that sure smells good .
i figure we 'll get along just fine .
what 's the matter -- restless ?
yes , people make me restless .
even women ?
there are n't any women here .
i suppose that 's your wagon in the river .
they packed their stuff on horses and went on .
and you 're all alone .
suppose i take a look .
until you came along we were going to sonora .
did you sell your place ?
can i make it ?
they threw us out .
they should n't have done that .
goodbye and thanks .
where would we be ?
and we 're running out of that .
until pa gets around to driving us to minden .
we do n't want to go there .
then it 's a day 's trip to sonora .
clay could save us an awful lot of time .
he certainly could . about a month .
you 're not giving up ?
go on . have another try at him .
what 's the use .
we might as well start a fire .
we 're leavin ' .
what do you think of that ?
how do you know who we are ?
everybody knows --
clay phillips .
where is he ?
how far up the trail ?
we got to get movin ' .

you know who i am , august ?
yeah - sure .
i 'd forget it if i were you .
mr. august , i 'm not at all sure -
where ?
do you know a mrs. redi ?
yes . she bought my sister 's business .
why would mrs. redi lie to me ?
you think my sister is there ?
you ca n't tell .
i do n't like this .
you scared ?
yes .
let 's get out of here .
it 's only a little way , mr. august .
i 'd like to get out of here .
we ca n't stand here all night .
you could go and open the door .
you understand that do n't you ?
yes , i understand .
then , you also understand that you must die .
when i wanted to .
may i have some water ? i 'm thirsty .
drink .
wo n't you wait , dr. judd ?
are you dr. louis judd ?
yes .
you 're not a dipsomaniac at your age ?
it would endanger her .
i would advise against you seeing her .
how much does she want ?
she could use a hundred dollars .
i 'll give you a check .
i have n't got that much in cash .
how much have you got ?
tell me , how is jacqueline ?
but tell me --
she 's nervous , naturally , under the circumstances .
why , mary --
hello , frances .
how 's miss jacqueline ?
i ca n't understand it at all .
`` the dante ? ''
people who see miss jacqueline never forget her .
why do n't you go into the beauty business .
is mrs. redi nice to work for ?
redi 's all right .
she seems rather an odd woman to me .
she 's a pretty good sort .
i like to work on your hair .
do you know what this is , frances ?
i ought to know .
what did she want ?
i did her hair .
what were you talking about ?
nothing .
and that was all ?
no . she asked about the trademark .
what did she want to know ?
she showed me a drawing .
i wish you had come to me first .
then you know where jacqueline is ?
but i 'd give a great deal to know .
why ?
i helped her get that room .
were n't you afraid ?
it 's hard to explain to a youngster .
thank you . it was a lovely dinner .
good .
i hope you 'll let me help you .
thank you.. .goodnight .
i made him do it .
but you have treated me that way .
i 've a job for you .
a job ?
they seem nice .
the people at the restaurant ?
what have you done about irving august ?
it 's like some of jacqueline 's stories .
if there were only some way --
who the devil is he ?
i want to find jacqueline to settle things .
we know what happened . do n't go on .
good night , jacqueline -- good night , mary .
i love you - you know that ?
but i 'm not joking .
you do n't even know jacqueline gibson .
well ?
do you think he knows about this ?
could you find him ?
what 's that ?
let her know what ?
she 'll have to know some time .
who are you ?
i 'm mimi -- i 'm dying .
no !
i rest and rest and yet i am dying .
i 've always wanted to die -- always .
i 'm tired of being afraid - of waiting .
why wait ?
and then ?
i do n't know .
i 'll only be gone until three .
i told her you were staying with me .
you 'll be all right ?
were you going to make a suggestion ?
at least you knew about dr. judd .
yes .
and you knew he 'd be here .
it 's terribly sweet of you , jason .
i have been at the library .
but you 're always at the library .
i do n't think that 's so revealing .
i do n't know .
no one else had read it since .
i 'm at sea , jason .
i want you to see all of it .
it turns out to be good-by . why ?
what could compel you --
do n't make me tell you , jason .
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man .
and you believe that ?
i 've been trying to find him .
what 's wrong , mary ?
it 's better this way .
then perhaps you might understand ,
i understand .
can i eat dry ?
and the other was judd ?
yes , dr. louis judd .
you have to get permission .
i just want to look at them .
where is jacqueline gibson ?
what a peculiar question .
it 's because of her i ask .
that 's why .
following me to find jacqueline ?
uhhuh .
wait - there is that other favor .
yes . when i tell you .
perhaps .
what was in your mind ?
what ?
dr. judd ?
it trips me up sometimes .
cloven hoof ?
would they hurt her ?
it seems right to us .
i was jacqueline 's psycho-analyst .
i have n't said anything of the sort .
but you would like to know where she is ?
yes . there are certain punitive measures ...
i thought you might understand and sympathize .
what unhappy people most of you are !
are we ? i thought i was very gay .
i was a great dancer ...
we commit no violence , unless ...
is it about jacqueline ?
i never thought you did .
i 'm very , very serious .
has she returned to her husband ?
how do you sign checks -- ?
it 's my business now .
i 'm stopping at the chatsworth .
i 'm afraid not .
yes .
this is mrs. redi , mary .
i 'll be out in a minute .
i 'd make no further attempt to find jacqueline .
why ?
i do n't believe it .
she 's not been here for a long time .
but she was here ?
yes -- and pays the rent every month .
that makes it all the more difficult 
difficult ? has anything happened to jacqueline ?
why do n't you try mrs. redi ?
i want to ask you about my sister .
yes ?
her name is jacqueline gibson .
this is a restaurant . many people come here .
miss gibson , i 'm tired of resting .
is it fifteen minutes yet ?
why
because i have something very important to do .
what ?
i 'll be right back with mrs. wheeler .
she told him about us .
she 's going back to school .
i 'm sorry to be late , natalie .
this is very trying for me .
you have only to drink a little .
ann ?
yes ?
that was quick .
false alarm .
we have a patio if you --
do you have other things ?
this is all i need to stay here .
have you ever been on television ?
television ?
yes .
no . why ?
graham is an unusual name .
she 's a prisoner of public television now .
oh , uh-huh .
are you uncomfortable with my appearance ?
no , i think you look ... fine .
did n't you do that when you were younger ?
no , not really .
how do you like being married ?
i like it very much .
... free-lance . you know .
like things are going to last awhile .
you mean like `` time flies '' ?
nine years .
nine years ?
why ? did n't you know him well ?
the two of you seem so different .
this food is excellent .
mother , father , sister .
sister older or younger ?
i do n't know .
what 's the first ?
would you mind ?
no .
do they ?
i feel like they do .
or would n't , anyway .
do you understand what i 'm trying to say ?
so what about kids ?
kids ? what about them ?
do you want them ?
at least not right now .
are you really going to tell me something personal ?
you 're what ?
impotent .
does it bother you ?
why do you say i 'm self-conscious ?
and you know what ?
what ?
my therapist said that --
you 're in therapy ?
are n't you ?
so you do n't believe in therapy ?
well , my therapist knows me intimately .
you had sex with you therapist ?
hi !
ann . hello .
are you in the middle of something ?
i 'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe .
what are these ?
videotapes .
it 's a personal project i 'm working on .
mine 's just a little more personal .
who 's donna ?
donna ?
on this tape it says `` donna '' .
donna was a girl i knew in florida .
you went out with her ?
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men .
all of these are interviews ?
yes .
can we look at one ?
no .
what ... what are these interviews about ?
the ... interviews are about sex , ann .
about sex ?
yes .
what about sex ?
everything about sex .
anything i can think of .
you just ask them questions ?
yes .
and they just answer them ?
mostly . sometimes they do things .
i 'm sorry this came up .
this is just ... so ...
maybe you want to go .
john and cynthia have been ... `` fucking '' .
i know .
you know ?
yes .
how did you know ?
she said it on her tape .
why did n't you tell me ?
do you think that 's such a good idea ?
do n't you want to make one ?
but i sense the element of revenge here .
that 's a good question .
what do you have to do to get ready ?
load a new tape , turn the camera on .
i have money .
what will you do when the money runs out ?
it wo n't . are you ready ?
tell me your name .
tell me your name .
ann bishop millaney .
do you talk to him ?
when we 're making love ?
yes .
sometimes . afterward .
you do n't know what i 'm thinking .
is he going to see this ?
did you have sex before you were married ?
i guess not .
!
why ?
!
so you do fantasize ?
yes .
about who ?
i fantasized about you .
about me ?
go down on me ?
yes .
not on tape , i mean ?
no .
on tape ?
no .
and i ca n't do it all .
ca n't .
you said you were n't always impotent .
that 's correct .
so you have had sex .
yes .
who was the last person you had sex with ?
her name was elizabeth .
was it so bad that it turned you off ?
that was n't the problem .
what was the problem ?
so you lied to her ?
yes . i did . willfully and repeatedly .
are you happy ?
subtlety ?
and you feel the same way with john ?
interesting analogy .
i 'm babbling .
no , you 're not .
god , i m so mad at him ! !
you 're really never going to make love again ?
i 'm not in love with you .
but if you were ?
that 's very flattering .
why would n't you , i mean ?
i ca n't .
why not ?
i 've told you .
who ? elizabeth ?
yes .
you mean you 're still in contact with her ?
no .
but you 're planning to be ?
i do n't know . possibly .
not entirely .
but that was part of it ?
yes .
like maybe a big part ?
do n't you think she will have changed ?
i really would rather not talk about it .
do n't do that .
why not ?
because .
come on , how does it feel ?
come on ! !
why are you ashamed ?
all that stuff you did ?
i want to touch you .
graham ...
john ?
who 'd you have lunch with ?
something wrong ?
are you having an affair ?
well , are you ?
frankly , i 'm offended at the accusation .
is that supposed to comfort me ?
but i 'm not .
i 'm not either ! !
why do n't i believe you ?
always the lawyer .
you 've made your point .
she 's so ...
loud .
is n't therapy helping at all ?
what happened ?
i want out of this marriage .
what ?
i want out of this marriage .
why ?
where did you go when you left here ?
did you make one of those tapes ?
goddam right .
bastard ...
you son of a bitch ! !
i have thought about it , yes .
god damn you ! !
what do you do when these moods overtake you ?
ann , do you see a pattern here ?
when did you begin having this feeling ?
what do you mean ?
did you masturbate ?
god , no .
i take it you 've never masturbated ?
so it was recently that you tried this .
i knew i should n't have watered those plants .
did you confront john about the visitor ?
is he still at your house ?
no , he left last week .
did you find him attractive ?
what do you mean , like physically ?
who was it that you talked to ?
do you think that 's possible ?
yes .
that you are under no obligation to me ?
yes .
do you want to leave therapy ?
i hate my sister .
religion , greed , philanthropy , drugs .
is he ? strange , i mean ?
i do n't know , unusual .
uh-huh . so what 's he look like ?
why , so you can go after him ?
do you have to say that ?
what ?
you say it just to irritate me .
ann , you always underestimate me .
i have a pretty good idea .
he does n't have a phone .
well , i 'll call him when he does .
but he wo n't .
let me talk to him first .
and what ?
a card ? for her fiftieth birthday ?
it 's her fiftieth birthday --
will you stop ? jesus .
i just thought it might --
all right ?
fine .
did you tell him about me ?
no , i did n't .
why not ?
because i never got around to it .
well , why ?
you do n't want to get involved with him .
did he make a pass at you ?
is he drowning puppies , or what ?
no , it 's nothing like that .
well , what ? is he dangerous ?
no , he 's not dangerous . not physically .
well , what , then ?
i do n't want to talk about it .
then why 'd you call me ?
he just asked me questions .
what kinds of questions ?
questions about sex .
apparently .
yes , i did .
cynthia !
what ! ?
why did you do that ?
because i wanted to .
but why did you want to ?
he would n't do that .
did he touch you ?
no , but i did .
in front of him , ann , yes .
you are in trouble .
what are you talking about ?
i ca n't believe you did that ! !
i feel like i do .
that does n't make you feel weird ?
i do n't want to discuss it .
here it is .
what is it ?
it 's a sun dress .
it looks like a tablecloth .
i was just trying to --
so what 's my share of the dress ?
thank you .
do you have my work number ?
i get real busy between two and four .
bye .
no , he did n't .
no , i touched me .
i wish you 'd get an answering machine .
there 's a phone here .
who are you ?
i 'm cynthia bishop .
do i know you ?
i 'm ann millaney 's sister .
she usually calls me loud .
may i ask why you 're here ?
you want me to leave ?
sisters talk . you can imagine the rest .
and upset .
nope .
she did n't tell you why she was upset ?
nope .
she did n't give you my address ?
nope .
you 're probably friends or something .
nope . i think the man is a liar .
oh , okay . i think i get it .
not exactly .
which is it ?
why do n't you let me tape you ?
doing what ?
talking .
about what ?
nothing .
you just want to ask me questions ?
i just want to ask you questions .
and that 's all ?
that 's all .
taping women talking about their sexual experiences ?
yes .
would anybody else see the tape ?
they are for my private use only .
how do we start ?
i turn on the camera . you start talking .
and you ask questions , right ?
yes .
how long will it take ?
no .
do i sit or stand ?
whichever you prefer .
i 'd rather sit . are you ready ?
i am now recording . tell me your name .
cynthia patrice bishop .
your first sexual experience .
to cleveland , actually .
very much live .
did it look like you expected ?
were you disappointed ?
it had character , you know ?
what did he say ?
he said that my hand felt good .
would you like me to take my pants off ?
you 're not wearing any underwear .
do you like the way i look ?
yes .
do you think i 'm pretty ?
yes .
prettier than ann ?
john does n't have sex with ann anymore .
is that what he tells you ?
hello .
okay .
no .
no ? not even one more ?
i 'm sorry .
i ca n't talk you into it ?
i have never taped anyone twice .
so make an exception .
who would know ?
i 'm sorry . i ca n't do it .
goddamit , give me my tape , then .
i 've got to get back to the office .
i 've already skipped one meeting .
i wish you 'd quit that bartending job .
and you are in no position to be jealous .
who said i was jealous ?
beautiful , popular , ann bishop millaney .
no , i mean doing it at my house .
afraid of getting caught ?

i really think he 's in a bad way .
i 'm intrigued .
you 're intrigued ?

john ?
hello .

john millaney .
i want to see you .

hello .
cynthia . john .
nothing wrong with trying .
do you want me to stop calling ?
i like the way he dresses .
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands ?
they just talk ?
right .
you told ann about this ?
i tell her almost everything .
i wish you had n't done that .
she 's a grown-up , she can handle it .
i just ... ann is very ...
hung up .
no .
this stuff could show up anywhere .
it wo n't . i trust him .
you trust him .
a helluva lot more than i trust you .
what do you mean ?
how much clearer can i be ?
it hurts that you would say that to me .
by definition you 're lying to ann , too .
i should n't have called .
i 'd like to do something ...
did he put you up to this ?
who ?
god , you ... you 're mean .
i know . will you please leave now ?

how 's mr. parker doing ?
i already did that .
you know where i 'll be .
you 're not baxter ?
my name is emmett .
hobart , what are you people doing here ?
this is where baxter and hawley brung us .

daddy ?
where is rae ?
what happened ?
who ?
you own this land .
hiding out , afraid to walk my own land .
what about the law ?
could have been any one of us .
pretty land , is n't it ?
i guess some women are slow to believe it .
believe it .
but it never lasts .
why ?
because they do n't like what i want .
what 's that ?
sure we are . we 're leaving at dawn .
yeah , that 's what happened with me too .
the other guy drew first .
did n't he tell you about blind pete ?
we did n't get that far .
'bout bust a gut .

howdy .
you wanted to see me ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'm done talking . get out .
you ca n't do this .

he owes me money for this damage .
now let 's talk about you chaps .
we 'd rather stay .
tomorrow morning . ten o'clock .
hello , rae .
i thought you were done with our family .
he was murdered .
this ai n't for you .
it 's none of your business .
rae , all we got is each other .
get out . we have nothing to talk about .
rae , i need help .
why come to me ?
i got ta talk to him .
what 's stopping you ?
i ca n't get through .
what makes you think i could ?
why would they stop you ?
why him ?
why are they doing this , mal ?
what happened to emmett ?
i got there just short of too late .
yeah , it 's working out real good .
he must be pretty good .
what about his brother ?
i hear ezra johnson got himself killed .
i heard that too .
hello , cobb .
i see you 're prospering without me .
it 's been a while .
appreciate the loan . i 'm good for it .
i 'm looking for some men .
i can use a guy like you .
you 've got a legitimate job .
yes , sir . you would n't believe it .
you got a place to stay ?
what brings you into my saloon ?
luck , i guess .
nothing like that will happen between us .
i took out thirteen dollars .
this is a lot of money .
i told you this was a sweet set-up .
it is that .
easy , boy . just an idea .
what is it you want from me ?
do nothing . do n't get between us .
i 'm a great believer in doing nothing .
so we understand each other ?
i 'm going to have to look into this .
yeah , maybe i will too .
i thought we talked about that .
everything will be put straight in a few days .
cobb , you 've got nothing i need .
i 'm worried about stella .
what 's she got to do with it ?
yeah . bad luck . good-bye , cobb .
you work here ?
if it does n't fit , you make alterations .
will you join me , miss --
stella .
stella ... are you the midnight star herself ?
this is what i call a saloon .
thanks . that 's what i call it too .
and i know what i 'm talking about .
you like a good saloon ?
it 's the only place i 'm happy .
he runs that side .
why 'd you go into business with him ?
the man who does stuck me with kelly .
who 's the owner ?
is this a fair mix ?
what 's this ?
that 's the good stuff .
you really are a gambler .
where 's the dog now ?
what is it that i ca n't figure ?
maybe that 's the kind of friend i am .
the world is what you make of it .
but it can be risky .
how about you ?
i do n't want you to get hurt .
treat him right .
i would n't worry about that .
i refer , of course , to edith .
it was her body of work .
tell the truth . you 'll feel better afterwards .
i am telling the truth .
i 'm on my way to see viktor now .
i owe viktor everything .
we 're just so ... different .
it sounds like you still have feelings for him .
i only make love to the camera .
okay -- for you .
thanks . this is my exit so , i --
i 'm glad we talked .
you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch !
-- do you know what these are , elaine ?
-- what 's wrong with that ?
the public decides who 's on that list .
please .
this is business .
spare me .
you 're not renewing my contract .
without a star there 's no movie .
where is she ?
good to see you too , elaine .
why is n't she with you ?
do you have simone 's check ?
almost right .
i arranged a press conference .
out of the question . a circus like that ?
viktor , it 's my studio .
sorry i did n't get her back in time .
no problem . do you want to come in ?
`` forever '' .
i still have n't received simone 's script notes .

meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants ?
yes .
that 's fantastic .
you killed her !
you murdered her !
she 'll come back .
no , she wo n't .
why would you let her to do that ?
so i am killing it before it kills me .
you fucking bastard ...
it 's solidifying taking on weight .
where 's snow ? did you call him ?
what 's wrong ? what happened to gibarian ?
he 's dead .
you did n't bring any chocolate , did you ?
what ?
i 'm too tired .
where 's sartorius ?
he wo n't let you in .
he 'll let me in .
is there anybody else here ?
why , who did you see ?
gibarian warned me . he left me a message .
who was it ?
i wo n't think you 're insane .
how much sleep do you need ?
how much sleep ?
how long can you go without sleep ?
was her breakfast conversation that bad ?
shut up .
at least , it fits my definition .
and professionally ?
day and night . who was she ?
my wife .
what was her name ?
rheya .
we were ready to go home .
will she come back ?
probably .
i wish you 'd told me .
what will you say ?
to who ?
what are you going to report back to earth ?
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed .
kelvin , you awake ?
why ?
that proves that --
not necessarily .
consciousness should be enough for anybody .
take the athena back .
perhaps it did .
human beings can die .
they come when you sleep .
what happened ?
she knows she ca n't leave here --
get out --
she knows everything . she knows who she is .
what plan ?
yes .
her oxygen would have run out .
you 'll see the transformation .
into what ?
she will die . then what will you do ?
i love her .
we need your help .
when did this happen ?
i think i made a mistake .
jesus ...
i wo n't make it .
oh , god . i 'm awake .
i need to see snow .
i 'll go with you .
do n't .
why ?
i ca n't be alone .
what are they ?
to calm your anxiety .
we 're taking a flight ?
rheya ...
`` and death shall have no dominion '' .
book ?
not a very happy poem .
you did n't look very happy .
i was n't .
and tonight ?
you want to fuck her ?
stop it .
you behave as though you want to fuck her .
let 's go home .
you go home .
i do n't want to do this here .
you 're better when you take them .
but still , somehow i do n't feel better .
what do you remember ?
what do you mean ?
movies , books , restaurants , friends ?
is it a planet ?
we had to unlearn everything .
is it intelligent ?
intelligent beyond our comprehension .
then it 's god , right ?
it 's something .
what happened ?
do you know why ?
where 've you been ?
freaky stuff .
how old were you ?
i guess that 's part of the reason why --
i loved it so much , that feeling .
what happened to us , exactly ?
why did you say those things ?
i think so .
i like that too .
sartorius wants to destroy it .
he has a point .
do i really feel like ... i am ... ?
yes . yes .
what 's wrong .
you do n't love me .
what are you talking about ?
who have you been talking to ?
sartorius .
but we fought .
yes . especially toward the end .
why did she do it ?
you ... she said i did n't love her .
was she right ?
no . i love you .
can you sleep ?
it 's all around me .
you 're the coward .
do n't debate him ; he 'll say anything .
you do n't want me .
rheya .
i ca n't explain it .
but that 's what happened before .
do you want to stay here ?
do you ?
what 's wrong ?
gibarian . he was here .
you said he was dead .
what 's happening to us ?
it 's all right .
i love you .
that wo n't happen again . we 're different .
you 've always known that .
rheya --
you are her , you are rheya .
i 'm disgusting .
no .
you 're lying . i 'm not human .
i 'm staying here with you .
then you 'll die .
chris .
you should have told me .
it would n't have made any difference .
thank you .
i did n't think you 'd react like this .
neither did i .
you never said you wanted one .
i never said i did n't .
chris --
i ca n't stay here .
i wo n't make it .
what do i have to do to stop it ?
i want you here .
you 're lying .
you exist here . i keep telling you .
that 's impossible . i 'm not rheya .
who are you , then ?
yes , you are --
is it like yours ?
i told you . it was exactly like mine .
is that really what you want ?
i want to stop taking those pills .
i wish you would n't .
it 's hard to think straight .
i think they help .
i ca n't --
stay with me .
am i really her ?
what are you taking ?
what does it want ?
how can i not hate something that does that ?
where did you go before ?
when ?
you were talking to someone in the corridor .
how can you be here ...
he wo n't do it .
why do you say that ?
we want to talk about ...
followed by non-human manifestations .
gibarian was under enormous --
snow , get up here , now .
i wanted to be snow .
you want it coming back with us ?
claire !

why would you want to leave ?
can i ?
yes , where would you go ?
i do n't understand .
together , we could-
i 'd like to welcome you all aboard .
well , may we have a look around ?
no , no . thank you .
we do n't have a tractor beam .
you left spacedock without a tractor beam ?
beautiful day , is n't it ?
as i said , this is some kind of-
it 's better .
better ?
antonia ?
captain of the enterprise , huh ?
that 's right .
close to retirement ?
what was the name of that planet=8a veridian iii ?
you 're going to be all right .
did we make a difference ?
oh
you know , scotty , it amazes me .
and what would that be , sir ?
but i do have a theory ...
a photon torpedo ?
keep her together until i get back .
why ?
did he say why you were searching for trilithium ?
no .
what has she told you about me ?
a little trick i picked up from the borg .
yeah , they 're full of great ideas .
no , i did n't know that .
let 's see what 's out there .
sir ?
you want me to contact starfleet ?
is there a problem ?
no , sir .
understood . that will be all .
sir , is there anything wrong ?
report .
all nuclearfusion is breaking down .
that 's a pretty big margin of error .
captain , are you all right ?
or perhaps they 're on the surface .
doctor soran ?
you must think i 'm quite the madman .
the nexus .
i would n't want to see you get hurt .
the royal ... studs ?
it looks like we 're too late .
trilithium ?
tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium .
they have found a way to penetrate our shields .
status !
all speeds available through transwarp drive .
enterprise maintaining full impulse power ...
stand by , tractor beam !
transwarp at your command , sir !
put me on the hailing frequency .
when do we get paid off ... ?
mr. chekov , i ordered spock 's quarters sealed !
will we get another ship ?
shall i alert dr. mccoy ?
acknowledge .
calm yourself , bones .
he orders you to surrender this vessel .
you did great , bones ... just great .
a warning about us .
response ?
nothing . as before .
send my compliments to captain esteban .
still no response , sir .
what did you see , chekov ?
for an instant ... a scout class vessel .
sir , the shields ... non- responsive .
aye sir , coding now .
do you wish to advise starfleet , sir ?
an energy surge .
locate .
surge from astern , sir . aft quarter !
could it be spock 's ?
i do n't believe it ...
why do n't we beam it up ?
can you guarantee that ?
hello , sir . it 's david .
david ! ... what went wrong ?
david , i do n't understand ...
this is where the fun begins , saavik !
temperature , twenty- two point two celsius .
minimal vegetation , temperature thirty-nine point four .
temperature -- temperature decreasing rapidly --
snow in the same sector . fantastic !
same sector . metallic mass .
underground deposit ?
approximately two meters long ... cylindrical in form ...
new orbit commencing ... coming up on sector three ...
short range scan .
verifying triminium photon tube ... no new data .
check for trace radiation . infrared enhancement .
only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix .
request computer study of soil samples for geological aging .
i 'll handle that later .
. .. spock 's tube ...
what is it ?
later . let 's go ...
you mean , we 're stranded down here ? !
we have to get thee hell off this planet !
not exactly .
why ?
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix .
it was the only way to solve certain problems --
did your collaborator know ?
this planet is aging in surges .
but at the rate things are going now ...
i 'm sorry .
i do n't understand .
whoever they are , they 're getting closer .
i 'll go ...
do you concur ?
our readings are well below danger level .
i 'm getting nervous ...
come in , please ...
request permission to beam aboard immediately .
captain , what 's happening ? !
a chimpanzee and two trainees could run her .
steady ... steady ... all right , mr. scott .
mr. scott , all power to the weapons systems --
sight on the center of the mass .
what 's wrong ?
how many more ?
just him , sir !
admiral , this is lieutenant saavik .
saavik ... is ... david with you ?
and someone else . vulcan scientist of your acquaintance .
this vulcan -- is he alive ?
what happened ... ?
the genesis planet is gone .
but that may not be possible .
that 's more than we bargained for !
the elders may not choose to attempt it .
what will happen to spock ?
my god ...
i know you ... do i not ?
you would have done the same for me .
yes , yes , spock ...
the ship ... out of danger ... ?
estimating spacedock in two point one hours .
the word , sir ?
i am therefore going anyway .
count on our help , sir .
... we have cleared spacedoors .
warp speed , mr. sulu ...
estimating genesis 2.9 hours , present speed .
see ! that shimmering area .
that distortion is closing rapidly ... opinion , sulu ?
i think it 's an energy form , sir ...
... a cloaking device ?
she 's arming torpedoes ... !
about a dozen officers and men .
sir , planet core readings unstable ... changing rapidly ...
what about surface life signs ... ?
close ... there --
we are clear and free to navigate .
the planet vulcan . in hailing distance , sir .
mr. sulu , you 're on manual .
no , sir , no response .
standby automatic approach system ... advise approach control .
how is doctor mccoy , sir ?
gentlemen . good evening .
good evening , commander . everything ready ?
will you be able to handle that ... ?
welcome aboard , admiral .
where 's doctor mccoy ?
admiral , i do n't understand . the enterprise --
no one is going to genesis !
understand ?
yours ... ? !
with scotty 's help ...
you 're right . thanks for the drink .
come in !
who is this ? ! how dare you --
david ? ... david !
i am going to kill one of the prisoners .
surrender your vessel !
no tricks , kirk . you have one minute .
maltz . prisoners are at beam coordinates . standby ...
you should take the vulcan , too .
no .
but , why ?
genesis , i want it .
this planet is destroying itself !
i think you know my crew ...
but -- why ?
his living spirit .
he would not have spoken of it openly .
then , how --
may i join your mind ?
... he spoke of your friendship .
yes ...
he asked you not to grieve ...
... yes ...
... the needs of the many outweigh ...
... the needs of the few ...
... or the one .
live long ... and prosper !
we were separated !
yes ... but -- how ... ?
bones ! ...
yet both in pain .
only there can both find peace ...
what you ask is difficult .
what about spock ?
i thank you . what you have done is --
what i have done , i had to do .
so ! speak !
share this with no one .
understood , my lord .
the secret of ultimate power !
success , my lord .
i ordered no interruptions .
range , 5,000 kellicams .
perhaps they wish to take you prisoner .
how can you tell that ?
they outnumber us , my lord --
execute course to the federation boundary .
range : 3000 kellicams .
1,000 kellicams , closing !
my lord ... what are your orders ?
he destroyed himself ...
it made kirk willing to die .
perhaps their information --
and i let him slip away .
but surely , our mission has not failed -- ?
you amaze me , commander .
some adventure ... even just a surprise or two .
admiral kirk , my god !
good for you , lieutenant .
no destination orders , no encoded i.d ...
!
have you lost all sense of reality ?
physician , heal thyself .
that 's all you have to say ?
bones , you know this stuff is illegal --
do n't be a pring ...
twenty-two , eighty-three ...
what did you bring me , contraband klingon --
cheers . bones , these are ... charming .
uh -- what are they ?
but i 'm allergic to retlax .
and you read printed matter through the bottom .
amazing ! i do n't know what to say --
say thank you .
why 're we treating yours like a funeral ?
bones , i do n't want to be lectured .
we all have our assigned duties and ...
and who am i hiding from ?
shore leave , admiral .
will someone please tell me what is going on ?
there may be people hurt .
they even killed the galley chief .
now that 's what i call a meal .
you okay , jim ? how do you feel ?
this is uss reliant --
this is regula i . go ahead .
do you read us ?
i still do n't under --
jim ... read me ? can you read me ?
what 's wrong ? what 's wrong ?
... ca n't read you ... repeat ...
repeat ... what 's wrong ? what 's wrong ?
... taking genesis away from us ...
taking genesis ? who ? who is taking genesis ?
did you ... order ... ?
what order ? who 's taking genesis ?
carol !
it 's just to keep them busy .
why ? why did n't you tell me ?
you did this -- in a day ? !
is that a poem ?
they 're just lazy .
if there 's one atom of life ...
next time , we 'll design a bigger one .
this has to be some sort of mistake .
david --
jim --
so are we , it looks like .
maybe it 's something we can transplant .
you 're crazy -- !
i saw it -- !
i told you i saw a --
but the child --
and would admiral kirk have access to such information ?
he 's on the fleet general staff .
where 's dr. marcus --
why did n't you tell me ?
it 's a long story .
it 's the genesis wave !
what ?
he 's on a build up to detonation !
how soon --
we encoded four minutes --
we 'll beam aboard and stop it --
i do n't mean to intrude .
i should be on the bridge .
i poured a drink . would you like it ?
i did n't expect anything .
it was just words .
maybe you should listen to them .
i 'm trying , david .
my friends were killed , too .
is that what you came here to say ?
let go -- he ca n't -- !
what are you looking at ?
the admiral 's son .
do n't you believe it .
steady on course . all systems normal .
they 're requesting visual communications , sir .
let them eat static .
they 're still running with shields down .
lock on target and prepare to fire .
sir -- our shields are dropping !
we must withdraw !
no !
well ?
departing dark side , regula .
we 'll lose them if they go in there .
tactical !
inoperative .
yours ... is ... the superior ...
of course , i remember you .
where is the crew of the reliant ?
all i ask is that you spare my crew .
in my judgment , you simply have no alternative .
time 's up , admiral ...
i never thought to see your face again .
i 've never even met admiral kirk --
what 's the delay ?
you have the coordinates to beam up genesis ...
aye , sir .
we 'll be going to warp speed --
scotty -- what 's left ?
i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
can you give me phaser power ?
just barely , sir .
uhura . ca n't you augment ?
she 's not responding ...
try the emergency channels ...
enterprise to reliant . come in , reliant .
mr. scott on discrete .
on screen .
admiral --
... no response , sir .
respond ! nothing , sir .
midshipman , you 're a tiger .
crazy to get to space .
give the word , admiral .
mr. scott , the word is given .
you 'll flood the whole compartment ... !
yes , spock .
we can proceed at impulse power .
meaning you ca n't even beam us back ?
it 's two hours . are you about ready ?
your first training voyage , mr. preston ?
yes , sir .
i believe you 'll find everything shipshape , admiral .
is the word given ?
the word is given : warp speed .
and you ?
permission to come aboard , captain ?
there 's a first time for everything , admiral .
why do n't you ...
anything else is a waste of material .
i would not presume to debate you .
how far ?
twelve hours and forty-three minutes , present speed .
carol marcus --
it literally is genesis ...
the power of creation --
have they proceeded with their experiments ?
what 's she doing here ?
is it possible their comm system has failed -- ?
they 're locking phasers -- !
they knew just where to hit us .
mr. sulu , divert everything to the phasers --
admiral , you ca n't give him genesis ...
the prefix code ?
it 's coming through now , khan ...
affirmative , admiral .
what do you make of the plantoid beyond ?
essentially , a great rock in space .
reliant could be hiding behind that rock .
mr. spock , the ship is yours .
what is working around here ?
we have partial main power ...
that 's it ?
uh oh .
reliant is closing .
admiral , they 're reducing speed .
could be an impulse turn .
but from where ... ?
spock !
the ship -- out of danger ?
... the good of the few ...
what do you think of my solution ?
dr. carol marcus .
in my quarters , uhura .
uhura ! what 's happening ? damn it ...
transmission jammed at the source , sir .
any suggestions , admiral ?
permission to speak candidly , sir ?
and why not ?
has that never occurred to you ?
lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ?
you earned it .
i failed to resolve the situation .
yes .
this is damned peculiar . yellow alert .
khan !
reliant 's command ...
on screen ...
indeterminate life signs .
all the memory cells have been emptied .
< u > what < /u > ?
that was close --
hold your course . look sharp ...
mr. saavik , all stop .
all stop , sir .
cease fire . look sharp .
saavik , get us out , best speed !
time from my mark ...
two minutes , ten seconds .
time !
three minutes , thirty seconds .
understood , sir .
admiral on the bridge !
as you were , mr. saavik .
stop engines .
course plotted for regula i , admiral ...
mr. sulu ... the shields !
i ca n't get power , sir !
approaching regula and space lab regula i .
admiral on the bridge --
phaser lock inoperative , sir .
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen .
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone .
i 'm aware of my responsibilities , mister .
shields activated !
mr. sulu , get us out of here .
aft thrusters , mr. sulu .
we are clear and free to navigate .
prepare for warp speed .
fire all phasers ... !
he 's not what i expected , sir .
what did you expect , lieutenant ?
he 's very human .
very well , mr. saavik , clear all moorings .
all moorings are clear , captain .
take her out , mr. saavik .
lieutenant , the admiral is aware of the regulations .
certainly ...
you lied .
i do not understand the final question ...
you are half human . the computer knows that .
the question is irrelevant .
but i can not wait here to find them .
where must you go ?
to earth . to offer testimony .
you do this -- for friendship ?
i do this because i was there ,
humans make illogical decisions ...
heard there was some excitement .
how 're you doing ?
fine . just fine .
i 've known you too long .
bob ... it 's tearing me apart .
sorry if i spoke out of turn .
without even letting me say goodbye ?
back home , we call him the miracle worker .
no ... what did you have in mind ... ?
you sure this is such a bright idea ?
it 'll come back to him .
are you sure ? that 's what i thought .
now wait just a damn minute .
we 've done it before .
if you do n't , you fry..
-- that 's the general idea .
it does n't look all that different .
what did you say she was getting ?
an experimental device , doctor .
wake up , man , wake up !
he 's coming 'round , jim ...
i think you 've saved the earth .
hi ... busy ?
uhura is busy . i am monitoring .
you 're joking ... !
i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile ...
specifically , humpback whales .
that is what i said , doctor .
angels and ministers of grace , defend us .
naturally . so what is your problem ?
... best shot ... ?
guess , spock . your best guess .
`` guessing '' is not in my nature ...
... i do n't think he understands ...
you 're saying ... it is a compliment .
doctor adams was supposed to assist me .
we 're just -- observing .
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
fundoscopic examination --
can you isolate the wave ?
find it ?
come in , please ...
i have the coordinates of the reactor ...
... it gives me a great sense of history .
let 's take it from the top .
the top of what ?
name ?
i do not know your name .
you play games with me and you 're through
go ahead . stun me .
cloaking device now available in all modes of flight .
a lot of effort for a short voyage .
and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations .
shields , mr. chekov .
shields , aye .
no choice now , scotty !
ah , well done , team 2 .
and admiral , it 's the enterprise .
cloaking device is stable ... all systems normal .
aux power is not responding .
`` neutralized ? '' how ?
can you protect us ?
to hunt a species to extinction is not logical .
attempting the hell to communicate .
but they are not the hell your whales .
i suppose they told you that ... ?
so you were at berkeley .
you sure you wo n't change your mind ?
you mean man ...
how soon ?
we were only trying to help ...
i buy that . what about him ?
i think he did too much lds .
we do n't want to be any trouble .
thanks .
memory problems , too .
what about you ? where you from ?
iowa .
they 're gon na hafta take their chances .
no , ma'am . no dipshit .
i want to know how you know that .
or believe , i 'll bet .
see you later , old friend .
do you trust me ?
implicitly .
just lucky , i guess .
you 're upset about losing the whales .
... you 're very perceptive .
where could you take them ?
hm ?
what 's that ?
what 's what ?
... who are you ?
i just work in outer space .
all right . the truth ?
i 'm all ears .
why all the coy disguises ?
you want the details ?
then tell me when the whales are leaving .
it would n't be my first choice , no .
so . there we are .
here ... in the park ?
it 's true ... what you said ...
steady , now . we need your help .
... is any of this real ?
look . the storage tanks for the whales .
it 's called a transporter beam ...
kirk . they 're gone .
... gone ? !
they 're in alaska by now .
what kind of spaceship is this , anyway ?
i 'm coming with you .
our next stop is the 23rd century .
i 've got nobody but those whales ...
the < u > frequency < /u > .
all right . the frequency is 401 megahertz .
you tricked me .
oh my god , we 're too late !
you mean this is -- goodbye ?
how will i find you ?
permission to come aboard .
permission granted .
thank you , admiral .
where are you going ? !
we would be responding in gibberish .
is there any other planet where this species exists ?
earth of the past .
we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth .
the probe would neutralize us easily .
mr. spock , your computations ?
in progress , admiral .
ready to engage computer , admiral .
what is our target in time ?
the late 20th century .
surely you can be more specific ...
you 've programmed that from memory ... ?
there is a 20th century possibility .
where would we find these reactors ... theoretically .
were n't those a birthday present from dr. mccoy ?
how do you propose to solve this minor problem ?
two humpbacks called george and gracie .
how do you know this ... ?
as you observed , a primitive culture .
yes .
admiral , may i ask you a question ?
come on , fellah -- speak up !
spock ...
yes ?
i see .
it is not always necessary to tell the truth .
exaggerate .
ca n't you remember ?
the hell i can't
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions .
status ?
the tank will be finished by morning ...
what about team two ?
we can only wait for their call .
admiral . full power is restored .
but is the human thing to do .
spock ... did braking thrusters fire ?
they did , admiral .
spock : condition report !
onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank ...
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed .
warp two ... three ...
mr. sulu ... ? ... mr . sulu ? !
... aye sir ... ?
what is our condition ?
sir ... braking thrusters seem to have fired .
aye , sir . descending .
ready sir .
wing five by zero , helm steady .
advise reaching 10,000 . steer three-one-zero .
three-one-zero , aye !
10,000 m.s.l. , admiral .
wing to cruise configuration ... full impulse power .
10 seconds , sir !
i have no control , sir !
systems report . communications ?
communications officer -- ready as she 'll ever be .
what is it ?
overlapping distress calls . some from starships ... others ...
admiral , i am receiving whale songs .
it 's coming from san francisco .
bearing to the whales ?
283 degrees ... 15.2 kilometers ...
any luck ... ?
nothing ... i should never have left him ...
uhura ! ... where !
bearing !
bearing 327 , range 600 nautical .
bearing 328 degrees .
estimate range , ship to whales !
i ca n't , sir -- nothing !
mr. scott , how soon can we get underway ?
they was givin ' me sour stomach .
scotty , how long is this bay ?
about 60 feet , admiral .
scotty , we have to find some humpbacks .
humpbacked - people . ?
and remember : two of them .
two ?
they 're giving out . de-crystallizing .
i thought i told you never to call me --
it 'll be well into tomorrow .
you 've got to do better !
let 's go find george and gracie ...
scotty : are the whale tanks secure ?
admiral ! there be whales here !
how soon can we be ready for warp speed ?
i 'll have to re-energize .
full power , sir .
we 're having some power fall-off ...
the whales ... ? !
no power to the bay doors .
the explosive override -- ?
there 's no way to reach it ...
go on ahead ... close the hatch !
thank you , lt. saavik .
how are you feeling ?
i am well , admiral .
well , saavik . i guess this is goodbye .
do you deny these events ?
we have the right to preserve our race !
professor scott , if you 'll --
with pleasure .
well , that 's different .
if you 'll follow me , professor --
i will . can my assistant come , too ?
... yes ?
i notice you 're still working with polymers .
sill ? what else would i be working with ?
we carry stuff that big in stock .
would that be worth something to you , eh ?
hello ? computer ... ?
just use the keyboard ...
transparent aluminum ?
that 's the ticket , laddie .
hi .
hi . huey 205 , is n't it ?
right on . you fly ?
father ... ?
i wanted to take my leave of you .
it is kind of you to make this effort .
your associates are people of good character .
koko de nani shiteru no ?
you have mis- taken me for someone else .
wait my son . what is your name ?
you have warp capability ?
why ?
i do n't like to leave questions unanswered .
deceive us ?
you must have noticed the effects by now .
but not you .
i do n't think so .
did that develop here ?
if you stay long enough , that 'll change .
in my experience , it 's unusual for ...
... an offlander ?
what 's the rush ?
mother and son . you arranged this ... ?
i plan on using them .
i am operating within normal parameters now .
you 're what ?
i understand .
do you like being a machine ?
i aspire to be more than i am .
do n't you ever get tired ?
really ?
sometimes i do .
chase me !
for what purpose ?
androids ... do n't have ... fun .
why not ... ?
anij !
tournel will take you the rest of the way ...
no ... i want to stay with you ...
i have to go home now .
can he breathe under water ?
data does n't breathe .
wo n't he rust ?
i had them confined to quarters .
are they in any danger ?
we should all be so lucky .
very funny ...
will he live ?
she 's stabilizing .
is it safe to move her ?
hello , data ...
captain , geordi ... ?
yes ... that looks like them .
and you ...
a ship ,
it is clearly federation in origin , captain .
how many ?
will the structure hold if we blast through ?
the girls will take twenty years off your face ...
i 'll order riker to turn around .
it is not over .
what kind of concerns ?
understood .
how 's data ?
in stasis . la forge is completing the diagnostic .
you 're not finished here ?
i 'll go to the federation council ...
a planet in federation space ...
you know what that makes us ? their partners .
let my people look at the technology .
if we could lure him away from the bridge ...
did you encounter any problems on the surface ?
but it was n't easy ... being among them ...
do you have a problem with those orders ?
may i talk to you alone ?
moving them is one thing . killing them all ...
they ... are in opposite directions , sir ...
do you know how they were damaged ?
i do n't believe it happened that way .
then , his fail-safe system was activated ...
implants bothering you ?
... had regenerated .
will that stop the tear ?
you got me , commander .
we 're pulling it like a zipper across space ...
options ?
highly volatile ... i recommend we keep our distance ...
i do n't think they believe us .
how long 'til they reach us ?
they 're powering their forward weapons array .
'yew-cheen chef-faw . '
who is it ?
deck five .
prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours .
you must be planning on doing some hunting .
i 'd just as soon you delete it ...
would you like something to eat ?
no , we 're here to ... rescue them .
that was three hundred and nine years ago .
we are approaching sector four-four-one .
worf to picard ...
yes ... yes , i ... can hear you ...
captain ...
come out , come out wherever you are ...
sir ?
when he does , we could beam him out ...
direct hit . he 's resetting his shield harmonics ...
scanners are off line !
do you know gilbert and sullivan ?
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire !
no , sir ...
have you been in a fight , commander ?
no , sir . it is a gorch .
isolinear tags . their transporters can lock onto them .
one . it 's ru'afo .
can you beam him off ?
... population three hundred million ...
counselor ?
the federation council suggested it be a joint mission ...
why was data assigned ?
what are they interested in ... ?
wine , women and song .
why would we be involved with these people ?
you have n't done that in a long time ...
what ... ?
what you 're doing to my neck ...
come in . hi .
do i ... lie down ... or what ?
this is n't one of the usual therapeutic postures ...
but it 's comfortable .
why do n't you try sitting up ?
or you could try lying down .
i think i 'm having a mid-life crisis ...
... i believe you ...
... i 'm not sleeping well ...
augh .
augh ?
initiate launch sequence .
your scanners must be malfunctioning .
can you handle it ?
absolutely .
good hunting . hayes out .
the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment .
it will take some ... time to explain .
montana . energize .
he may be injured or dead .
cochrane ... the inventor of warp drive ?
what are we waiting for ? let 's go .
are you saying they wo n't help us ?
will you be all right ?
you actually performed surgery ... ?
any word from the enterprise ?
not yet .
nothing can change that .
how long has he been unconscious ?
is it japanese ?
we 've got to get him on a respirator .
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg ... ?
how does it feel ?
they have tried to help me .
did they even try ?
is n't it better like this ... ?
yes ... but the enterprise ... my duty ...
i need it ...
a ship has entered sensor range .
vulcan ?
can you configure it ?
i believe so .
dispersive armor is holding .
our phasers will no longer be effective .
we are approaching the terran system , captain .
go to impulse . where 's the borg ship ?
it is heading directly toward the surface .
i have helm control .
the vortex is collapsing , sir .
give me a damage report on that missile silo .
who are you ?
i am the borg .
there are no individuals .
did you know her ?
juice ?
where 's the battery room for the hospital ?
i told you , there 's no --
where ?
what did you do to the batteries ?
this must be it .
how serious is the damage ?
there 's a lot of radiation leaking from something .
we need a password to get in ...
picard to enterprise . enterprise , please respond .
can you reconstruct the throttle valve ?
ready to make a little history ?
always am .
when the ship launches ... she 'll be killed .
tell her to go back to resurrection .
captain --
what 's still there ?
solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms ...
altitude fifty kilometers ...
i 'll lay in a heading .
we 're ready to ignite the warp drive .
the starboard nacelle 's running a little hot ...
we 're starting to pick up relativistic effects !
captain , the enterprise !
atr setting ...
active .
main bus ...
ready .
thank you . mister ... ?
and you are ?
jean-luc picard .
great name . french ?
yes .
where in the states ?
you know how it is .
where are you from most recently ?
california . san francisco .
i did n't think anyone still lived there .
how 'd you do it ?
i used to be an electrical engineer .
i wanted to see how he was doing .
he might be dead now .
you seem to have an answer for everything .
something wrong with that ?
what do you want ?
the invasion plans .
there is no invasion ...
he 's a very special man .
did you need something ?
so you can get dome money ...
i can try .
and how do you know zephram ?
what ?
you 're lying .
it 's very important .
but it 'll have to wait until tomorrow .
it ca n't wait until tomorrow ...
i 'd say you already have .
it 's been damaged and --
friends from cornell ...
some .
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon .
it 'll take five minutes .
you 're leaving , are n't you ?
i have to ...
where ? and do n't tell me san francisco ...
no . it 's a lot further than that .
i knew you were n't from around here .
that 's impossible .
we 'll cover them .
incoming transmission from the borg .
life signs ?
track their weapons fire .
port battery , ready sir !
worf , quantum torpedoes at my command !
hull integrity down to thirty percent ...
but the computer targeting system has been destroyed .
target locked !
civilian clothes .
incoming transmission from starfleet command . admiral hayes .
report .
we 're still in earth orbit .
looks like they damaged the silo ...
life signs ?
good luck , sir .
return to our own time ?
yes , sir .
but captain ... are we ... all going back ?
unless you 'd like to stay .
minor buckling on the port nacelle . nothing serious .
so far , they 've had no success .
a ship-wide decompression has been initiated !
main engineering ... or the bridge .
what are they doing ?
they 're re-routing the deflector power conduits ...
they 're connecting the conduits to subspace communications ...
we have to stop them from sending that message .
agreed . options ?
are you alright ?
it would be ... unpleasant .
i 'm going to need at least five minutes !
report !
we 've lost bridge control !
emergency override !
someone ... ?
seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields .
they 're bypassing engineering ...
i remember it made me sick .
worf to bridge .
we 're about to enter the environmental control room .
worf ? is something wrong ?
what the hell happened down there , worf ?
mr. president .
good luck , captain .
i believe the operation is over .
you may need assistance , doctor ...
bet you wish you 'd stood in bed ...
spock , that was actually funny .
or not to be -
uh , jim ...
what the hell 's going on ?
can you - ?
no !
thanks ...
figures .
let them know we 're not holding a grudge .
what a way to finish .
we 're not finished .
- < u > kobayashi maru < /u > ...
bones , are you afraid of the future ?
that was the general idea i intended to convey .
i did n't mean this future .
specifically of ... ?
what is it with you , anyway ?
still think we 're finished ?
last night you two were spooning -
jim , leave me - i 'm finished ...
if they 're even looking for us ...
damned clever if you ask me ...
absolutely not !
like this one .
this is fun ...
too bad we ca n't smell her .
are you carrying a surgeon ?
we were until your torpedoes !
in three months i 'm due to stand down .
stand ... ?
retire .
was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him ?
i was nervous -
they 'll respect him now ...
it takes a lot of effort .
i 've always wanted to meet you , captain .
would you care to go topside ?
we need breathing room ...
my god , what happened here ?
you feign ignorance ?
he 's a doctor !
he just tried to save him !
i checked the data banks , yes .
and what did they tell you ?
are those your words ?
yes .
spoken by you ?
yes ...
louder , please . we can not hear you .
you were demoted ...
yes .
for insubordination .
you deny enterprise fired on kronos one ?
where is mr. sulu ?
?
just the size of my head -
torpedo room -- ?
from starfleet ?
she 's here - somewhere .
shields . battle stations .
they 're preparing to fire .
what are we searching for , mr. spock ?
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory .
now we go to starfleet ?
now we expand our search to include uniforms .
if we 're discovered ...
only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise .
aye , sir .
an incident ?
do we report this , sir ?
attach our co-ordinates .
this is kronos one . i am chancellor gorkon .
your research laboratory is most impressive ...
all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors ...
the evening has been most ... edifying .
your friends are late ...
is n't it about time you became something else ?
what took you so long ?
kill him ! he 's the one ! !
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens .
he 's got it .
and your coat .
it would n't fit him , anyway .
how did you know ... ?
we do n't get many presidential assassins .
we did n't kill gorkon .
how much time 's left of your sentence ?
no one has ever escaped from rura penthe .
except us .
i know how to get outside the shield .
where do we come in ?
can you ?
possibly .
stand down your weapons .
captain , if --
all stop . that 's an order .
this is incredible -
as you were . lieutenant ... ?
aft thrusters -
aye , sir .
plot a course for kronos , lieutenant .
kronos , sir ?
i 'm still in the chair , lieutenant .
sorry -
i do n't think many on board are .
you piloted well out of spacedock , lieutenant -
i always wanted to try that .
right standard rudder , bring us alongside ...
i hope you 're happy .
sir ?
captain , our shields -- !
just the prototype .
this is captain sulu , uss excelsior .
sulu !
and she can fire while she 's cloaked .
surely not .
when does this conference start ?
according to my information , today .
thank you , captain sulu .
that 's ... ... arrogant presumption -
jim , there is an historic opportunity here -
do n't trust them . do n't believe them -
they 're dying .
never been this close .
what is it ?
i am uncertain .
spock , i 'm really tired ...
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation .
where ?
curiously it appears to emanate from us .
what the -
i will go .
captain ...
she torpedoed gorkon 's ship .
the peace conference .
she ought to have the co-ordinates .
why would they give them to us ?
you might have died .
i could n't trust .
you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan .
i should have been -
human beings -
but i am not human . i am only -
close enough to beam down ?
control tower , reading , sir .
captain --
we surrender .
gorkon 's own man ? ?
uhura ?
you must have faith .
faith ... ?
her own father ... ?
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch , lieutenant .
not as yet , sir .
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir .
a lie ?
a lie ?
if you are logical .
i do n't want to .
direct hit -
trouble ?
hence the word sabotage .
we can send a message to starfleet command -
sir ?
you having hearing problems , mister ?
our sensing and analytic equipment worked well .
do n't tell me that was any meteor shower .
barren of indigenous life forms but -
i have confirmed the location , sir , but ...
what is it ?
praxis ?
i -
no way !
one computer is lying .
a computer canna lie , sir .
that could take hours !
nevertheless .
and if they 're still in place ?
and there were no other ships present .
there was an enormous neutron energy surge .
- could take weeks , sir .
mr. scott , start your engines .
we 've been at war a long time .
fuzzy face is gone .
yes , please continue .
do you know who i am ?
you are me .
do you know where you are ?
can you remember our father ?
no .
why ?
because you are dangerous .
i do not understand .
no . can i move now ?
no . i must deactivate you .
for how long ?
indefinitely .
when was he ... created ?
beverly , come in .
remember him ?
he was a bit proud as i recall .
very much in need of seasoning .
whatever he 's after , it 's not peace .
is he very much like you were ?
he 's someone else .
but the romulans abandoned the plan .
he 's dying .
that was another time .
not tonight , i have work here .
so ... to happy endings .
dr. crusher going to starfleet medical ...
and this makes you `` sad '' ?
the ship will seem ... incomplete without them .
i would `` miss you . ''
now , you make a toast .
to new worlds ...
he is very observant .
data !
i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation .
good work . the download ?
a bit less florid , data .
a weapon .
it 'll only work for one of us .
yes , sir .
alacrity would be appreciated , commander .
what do you imagine this is ?
can you open the shuttlebay doors ?
ready , captain .
of you ?
yes .
how can you be sure ?
the projections will return when we have cleared it .
it 's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography ?
the rift effects all long-range communications .
we are losing dorsal shields .
we are being hailed .
you are needed here .
negative .
why am i looking at me ?
you are looking at me .
you have a red shirt .
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation .
how many of you did dr. soong make ?
something dr. soong created before data .
you feel comfortable with that ?
an individual more like you , you mean .
yes .
what purpose does this serve ?
it appears to be ... ... an arm .
it 's you .
no .
if you would n't mind .
really , captain , it was a lovely toast .
may i have this dance ?
counselor .
do you have a moment , sir ?
you 're speaking of emotional investment ?
i 'm going to miss you .
is he sincere about wanting peace ?
the same way you want to know him .
i request to be relieved of my duties .
how can you be certain ?
but how can he ? he 'll kill you .
i 'm only half human .
imzadi . this is so good .
he can never touch you as i touch you .
this is n't real .
now and forever .
you 're not here .
no .
might we be of assistance ?
your timing is impeccable , commander .
open a channel .
we 're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies .
what do we know about the planet ?
cannon fodder .
what 's he doing ?
sir ?
aye , sir .
deanna , on my mark .
how long until he can fire ?
captain , i do n't know if the transporter ...
now , mister la forge .
sir , we 're being hailed .
i 'll take care of it , sir .
with or without the rest of the fleet ?
new praetor ?
just lucky , admiral .
enterprise . we are the reman warbird scimitar .
praetor shinzon , i 'm pleased to ...
what are you doing to counsellor troi ?
that will never happen .
you 'll find we 're a resilient species .
i wo n't do it .
wont do what , mister worf ?
to find the head , sir ?
sir , i recommend we raise shields .
no !
captain !
we 're being hailed .
scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes .
sir , we 're being hailed .
triangulate fire on any shield impacts .
what 's this ?
thank you , sir ...
sir --
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators .
why do n't they answer our hails ?
it 's working .
she 's not out for a pleasure cruise .
not very chatty .
sir ?
he is going after earth .
destroy humanity and the federation is crippled .
strength in numbers ?
report .
and she 's getting a captain worthy of her .
ignore him .
serving with you has been an honor .
and you 're not as we imagined you .
praetor ?
i see now there 's a world elsewhere .
and the senate supports you ?
do you know of it , captain ?
we need to talk , just you and i .
or just the one of us .
you know i need to verify this .
it was a bold plan .
i ca n't stand it .
it 's not quite the face you remember .
not quite . i envy the hair- line .
the eyes , you recognize the eyes .
yes . the eyes have it .
yours are so confident .
how did you end up on remus ?
you 're doing this to liberate the remans ?
you do n't trust me .
i have no reason to .
were we always explorers ?
but i had spent my whole life ...
looking up at the stars .
yes .
about ...
after you , praetor .
so i 'm not as tall as you expected ?
i always hoped i would hit two meters .
with a full head of hair .
shinzon ... i 'm trying to believe you .
in time , jean luc .
hello , jean luc .
why am i here ?
what are you doing ?
all of this so you could capture me ?
or maybe ill snap its ugly head off .
what 's this all about ?
about a reman outcast who ...
you 're not reman .
i see the man i will never be .
a shadow ? an enigma ?
for conquest .
we 're quite alone .
your ship and mine ... you and me .
why are you here ?
long ago .
not so long .
i 'm what you see now .
he is better than that !
could you do that ?
i do n't know .
that 's your life ... not mine .
please .
its too late .
make the right one now !
i hope you 're still alive , jean luc .
i am .
praetor , we 've received the transponder signal .
report !
target disruptors . destroy them .
then set a course for earth .
what about picard ?
well , that sounds relaxing too .
so theyve got him up and running .
he 's a very unusual android .
my god ...
minimal damage to the scimitar .
intruder alert !
are we prepared ?
this is a mistake .
and he has a sense of humor .
now . time is running out .
the bond is broken .
find her again .
no -- this is wasting time .
you have no more time for games .
how long ?
how long until we reach the rift ?
what ? !
praetor ...
focus on your job ! !
now what 's the disposition of the fleet ?
they 're holding position .
and ?
how many warbirds will you need ?
they supported the coup , they 'll follow you .
the scimitar will serve my needs .
but surely ...
you do n't have to understand .
what possible purpose could that serve ?
i have a purpose .
then perhaps you will enlight- en us ?
praetor .
i thought we discussed patience , commander .
does that satisfy you ?
benny , god , take it easy ...
right in line with that burning tree .
i do n't see anything .
benny , there 's nothing there .
what did i tell you ?
do n't you think you should call a backup ?
benny , you all right ?
i do n't think so ...
gate three . it 's boarding now .
thank you .
what can i do for you folks ?
you have one with two beds ?
sure .
i 'll take that .
will this be cash or credit card ?
credit card .
do you have a good map of death valley ?
that 's how i make money .
i understand .
what do you do ?
i make maps .
hey , that sounds interesting . you like it ?
eh ... yes .

do you have children ?
what do you think of america ?
thank you .
no ! ! ! no ! ! !
where did you stop last ?
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
where did you stop last ?
stay right there ...
what was your last stop ?
elmo 's ...
where 's that ?
understand me , shermin ?
houston found it in the extraterrestrial 's suit .
it 's real , george .
there 's no mistake ? you 're absolutely sure ?
we 've killed an extraterrestrial and ...
could you be mistaken ?
you could hide an army up here .
contain it and get back to me .
at least it 's a point of contact .
we ca n't find this thing alone .
it 's in a green mustang ?
it 's taken on a disguise .
the extraterrestrial now looks like this .
i do n't like it , george ...
hello george .
shermin ...
what 's all this for ?
i 'm taking over .
we can catch him this time .
you 're not hearing me .
he can disappear .
that 's the chance we have to take .
you 'll be in the air with us .
no deal .
george ... do you hear me , george ?

i just retired .
mrs. haydn ...

this has always been my favorite time of day .
can you see under the faceplate ?
then it shot straight up and disappeared .
was there visual contact ?
no , sir . radar .
it might be alive .
oh , jesus .

i would n't think so .
hello ...
i must get to my ship , mr. shermin .
we ca n't let you do that .

right ?
and my customers want uncut .
jack right into the big black .
it 's policy . i got ethics here .
so lay it off to somebody else .
gets you pumpin ' .
better than the usual soaps you bring me .
ha ! that 's for fucking sure .
i do n't like this at all ...
what ?
i mean she was just here .
who was just here ?
iris , man . pay attention .
iris was here ? !

it 's alright . he means it .
nero .
strickland .
commissioner strickland .
and do you know what disappoints me very much ?
your sex life ?
so let 's hear this week 's sad story .
i 've already pulled twelve hours today .
sleaze to peddle .
it 'll be fun --
what part of no do n't you understand ?
mace ! you 're a life-saver .
another busy night selling porno to wireheads ?
sex is only part of it .
i save lives .
and maybe he really does catch something --
lenny , this shit 's illegal .
yeah , but that was for love .
what 's his name ?
what the fuck are you doing ?
coming with you .
are we having a bad night ?
this is armani . you angry ?
you 're on foot , lenny .
it 's still in the back .
that would be no .
i 'm just trying to hold on here .
so am i . just trying to get by .
no , you 're just trying to get off .
thanks , mace . really .
look , i got ta get some sleep .
it 's on your way .
jesus , lenny .
forget her .
she still loves me .
trust me on this .
she 's my destiny .
but you still come out this goofball romantic .
what 's that ? present from faith ?
what is it ?
my god , lenny . what is it ?
black . jack .
blackjack ? i do n't understand --
and gives it to you .
no way ! they 'd crucify me .
he 's worn before ... a lot .
so that gives you something .
you 're gon na fry yourself .
no more , lenny .
random kill . the kind you never solve .
but that does n't add , does it .
no it does n't .
but then why give the rape to me ?
that 's where it gets a little strange .
and what about the guy that was following me ?
you want to rub my neck ?
how 's zander ?
i 'm sorry .
whatup lenny ?
where we going ?
what is it ?
will you relax . there 's nobody back there .
relaxing might be right out , okay ? !
you better keep a low profile for a while .
lenny , have you lost it completely ?
lenny , give them the tape .
shit !
take it easy . the glass is bullet resistant .
bullet resistant ? whatever happened to bullet proof ?
this is bad .
are you out of your fucking mind ? !
those two guys were cops .
you sure ?
tell me .
you 've got to see .
uh unh . i wo n't do it .
hang on , max . you see ?
jesus . maybe they ought to see .
happy new year , lenny .
well , look at the plus side .
there 's a plus side ?
that 's real progress for you .
i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her .
why ?
he 's totally cut off from the outer world .
who 's strickland ?
can you borrow a dress from cecile or something --
i 'm not going .
tran 's gon na do her right there unless --
yeah . lenny . i have .
did it ?
another lost soul .
you never told me .
mace ... you 're a girl .
got your ticket ?
you see tran ?
alright . we 're going up .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
that 's the original . there are no copies .
take it to him .
you want me to trust a cop ? !
oh boy . what if you 're wrong ?
then we 'll be right where we are now .
are we under arrest ?
hey , lenny . we made it .
well ... get going . you 're still bleeding .
see you downtown .
did you meet a guy ?
just lenny .
right . that explains it .
what is that ?
i made it myself . it 's good .
let 's go . chop chop .
business ?
hey , is n't that tran vo ?
could n't happen to a nicer guy .
but i mean is n't he faith 's new --
problem is , lenny knows everybody .
who the fuck are you to bury this ? !
was this him ?
um ... he was older .
he knew the guy 's name .
testa ?
have you had a chance to think about --
remember suspect zero ?
no .
that 's where they stuck dick low .
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials .
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory ?
is that ... ?
agents duncan , mackelway . anything new ?
just mopping up . nine bodies in all .
anybody talk to the press ?
no , sir .
where 's the nuevo american diner ?
just disappeared a couple weeks back . vanished .
you 're thinking ... ?
who knows .
this is n't in our database ?
agent mackelway .
mack , this is sheriff dylan .
that 's the good news .
what 's the bad news ?
you tell me .
we got it staked out -- you interested ?
want to take a look ?
what does the manager say ?
on the seat .
dylan here .
remember me ?
hi there .
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case .
you heard ?
what ?
you have the body ?
i 'm sorry . this wo n't take long .
the body was embalmed . i do n't understand --
these burn marks .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
my capacity is 5.5 tons , not 6 .
i have 6 tons .
it 's been customized for sleeping capacity .
you must get asked this a lot .
jesus .
you ... surprised me .
always lugging that case around . whatja sell ?
i did n't get your name .
you must travel a lot , huh ?
yeah .
whole country or just hereabouts ?
how does your wife feel about it ?
what ?
must get lonely .
look ...
you ever think about , you know ...
excuse me ?
what are you ... ?
look , mister ...
my god .
not bad , huh ?
you 're a ... you 're sick .
oh god , mister , please leave me alone .
you 're going to miss it . pay attention .
i 've been looking for you .
yes .
what did he look like ?
how did you know he was a construction worker ?
gone today .
what kind ?
a ford or ah , yeah , a ford .
what about his killer ?
you have the photo from the diner ?
at the field office .
he said it was a clue ?
maybe something to do with zorro .
she has a background in medical forensics .
maybe cause he 's smart .
what ?
we have another one .
another what ?
deputy director , get out , sir .
what are you doing ?
i think i talked to him .
who ?
speck . harold speck .
from the grave ?
-- no way .
its called insubordination .
how do you feel , agent
i had him . he got away .
do you think he singled you out ?
i 'll take it into consideration .
why you ?
you feeling okay , agent mackelway ?
had trouble sleeping last night , sir .
nothing i 'd ... well , nothing .
i do n't believe this .
i 'm hesitant to ...
i spoke with lloyd daitz .
that way he could exit a hero .
that 's why you came to el paso .
how long ago ?
that 's why i brought you back here .
why did you go to chicago ?
i was visiting an old college friend .
you did n't tell anyone where you were ?
i was looking for a pattern .
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation .
i did n't use low 's name .
there was talk of a file photo .
he 's got you believing in zero now too .
i need to get to amarillo immediately .
have you told richard low about amarillo ?
he could be stalking now .
dick low 's a killer too .
miss me , dave ?
i tried to stop him . he cold-cocked me --
none taken .
the academy , then ciiac .
how long have you been downtown ?
you work with koessler ?
not especially .
what 's going on ?
and who kills in the manner of his victim .
that information 's being withheld from the media .
some kids found you in a garbage dump .
yes i do .
the man knew how to dress .
do n't even go there . what 's up ?
the correspondent becomes `` ghosted , '' invisible .
what about the chat rooms themselves ?
i need to learn this stuff .
the other reason ?
then i had my disagreement with koessler .
you got a point there .
they sort of came together .
and one other thing .
what 's that ?
look at this fellow ... or this one .
does he really think he looks good ?
he thinks he looks young .
what 's this country coming to ?
i want to save her .
make any headway with `` zorro '' ?
nobody knows this stuff better .
did he hit on you ?
huh ?
did he come on to you ?
why did koessler assign you as my liaison ?
because you asked him to , stupid .
there are agency regulations about this .
`` intra-agency fraternizing . ''
it 's a no-no .
i know .
i 've been thinking about this .
does koessler ask about me ?
he 's called a couple times .
what did you tell him ?
just routine stuff .
not about coming to see daitz ?
find the feet ?
unfortunately , he 'd soundproofed his van .
we got an unsub walking around with four feet ?
the tattoo ?
sue ann hanson .
you mean --
did they disconnect testa 's computer ?
i thought i 'd surprise you .
maybe we should back off a bit .
that 's true .
then there 's the other issue .
what 's that ?
about the case , about you and me .
and nobody else can do that ?
not the way i can .
hello ?
jaime ? where are you ?
where are you ? everybody 's looking for you .
what 's up ?
he sent me to chicago .
get him to come to you .
start killing people for real ?
suspect zero .
that 's a crackpot theory . everybody says so .
this feels like something out of a spy novel .
i guess i 'm a little paranoid .
slow down a second , you met with low --
you were right . he found me .
and you 're working with him ?
does one exist ?
koessler does n't know any of this ?
i 'd be real careful if i were you .
but why this pattern ?
tom , you okay ?
everybody calls me mack . i always liked that .
you okay ?
yeah , of course .
it 's quite advanced .
all the same killer ?
low calls him suspect zero .
you said so .
i have n't changed anything . damn .
i ...
jaime --
what happened ?
agent ...
kulok .
unlock these cuffs .
mack must think zero has a police band .
do n't you want to save the boy ?
okay , i 'll unhook you . no weapon .
no weapon .
you need me .
how did you know speck was a killer ?
who are you ?
agent mackelway ?
yes .
i will instruct you where to drive .
yes , sir .
how 's the arm ?
i spoke to koessler , professor daitz .
he still writing those crime porn books ?
he 's moved on to tv .
what was your weakness , sir ?
i got obsessive .
i 've always had a good sense of intuition .
so you went underground ?
where 's the file ?
i do n't carry it with me .
a pool of possible victims .
zero killed them all ?
how did you get it ?
i was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned .
you knew it was me all along ?
be my man .
the girl in the pink sweater .
who told you about her ?
it was the mall .
i ca n't carry on alone .
that 's what i did .
is he dead ?
yeah .
was it zero ?
[ reality very risky . ]
[ lionheart , what happened ? ]
lead the way , murman .
i 've been to chicago .
you 'll owe me one . ]
if i owe , i will go .
let 's talk about zero .
i want to help you .
koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation .
there 's nothing in the bureau mainframe . ]
why would the zero file be kept secret ?
[ you tell me . ]
at whose request ? david koessler .
[ what does the file say ? ]
good morning , sir . agent salinas , sir .
so you 're the new meat ?
yes , sir .
what did you do to end up here ?
i believe it 's in my file , sir .
mackelway , right ?
thomas mackelway .
that 's why they 're here .
i screwed up twice , sir .
philly 's a nice station . how many agents ?
i was undiplomatic in my request .
yes , sir .
your old boss is coming out .
koessler ?
no .
`` mydick ? ''
that was his screen name .
i do n't ...
it 's the same guy . speck was mydick .
speck is dead .
how far is amarillo ?
locate a jet , we 're going to amarillo .
all he cares about is low .
i am lionheart .
murman !
brilliant enough to catch you .
it 's over for you .
end of final message .
shit .
you have to put things in perspective .
i know , i know .
you 've been through worse .
you 're right . i know .
ever since i 've known you .
it did n't feel that way .
it was hard , but you rose to it .
okay . i 'll think about that . bye .
enough . i 've got to use the phone .
are you calling her ?
you should call your grandmother .
do n't do it , mike .
how are you ladies doing this evening ?
what do you drive ?
i 'm sorry ?
what kind of car do you drive ?
you like laughing at the misery of others ?
on pico ?

hi , mike . i 'm lorraine .

why ? you 're not a real man ?
how was it hard ?
well , i left someone very special behind .
tell me about it ...
you too ?
yeah .
tell me it gets better .
it does .
like what ?
what else ?
let 's see ... you have complete freedom .
whatever you want .

hey man , do n't sweat it .
your advice really helps .

where are you from originally , annie ?
san francisco .
i guess you knew that , anyway .
i suspected as much .
a long time ago .
annie -- there 's nothing between mitch and me .
when was this ?
things may be different now .
different ?
with lydia . did she seem a trifle distant ?
a trifle .
and what had you done ?
then what was it ?
then why did she object to you ?
because she was afraid .
afraid you 'd take mitch ?
afraid i 'd give mitch .
she already has a daughter .
did n't he have anything to say about this ?
i see .
i did .
that 's the first reason .
and the second ?
it should be fun , melanie .
do you think i should go ?
never mind lydia . do you want to go ?
yes .
is anyone there ?
look .
his chickens wo n't eat , either .
mr. brinkmeyer 's feed is no good .
of course , they 're mostly hoods .
yes , i did .
mother !
mitch , can i bring the lovebirds in here ?

mom , they 're in a cage !
they have n't harmed anyone .
miss daniels ?
i ca n't tell which is which .

i got them all , mother .
when do you think they 'll come ?
that 's a chance we have to take .
maybe we ought to leave .

let 's bring that wood in .
we 'll break up the furni ...
i 'm ... trying ... my ...
mitch ...

i can handle it .
i 'm not very good at this , mitch .
you 're doing fine .
they 're gone . the same pattern .
but they 'll be back .
we wo n't be here .
there 's no place to go .
there are buildings there . steel and concrete !
they 're probably all over the road .
mother , the house wo n't take another attack .
if they 're already there ?
they wo n't be .
if they are ?
we 'll worry about that when we get there .
mother , i want us to stay alive !
i started to say ... inside ...
i thought you might like some tea .
where 's mitch ?
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm .
why ? did n't al believe my story ?
he was calling from the farm , mrs. brenner .
then he saw .
he sent for the santa rosa police .
do you think cathy 's all right ?
what ?
yes , i 'm sure she 's fine .
do i sound foolish to you ?
no .
in dan 's bedroom . all the windows .
try not to think of that , mrs. brenner .
do you think cathy 's all right ?
annie 's there . she 'll be all right .
that 's a rare talent .
yes .
i feel safer with him here .
would you like to rest now , mrs. brenner .
and i want so much to understand .
you liking me ?
i want to like any girl he chooses .
do you think she 's safe at the school ?
would you like me to go for her ?
i could n't ask you to .
i do n't mind , really .
that 's the last of it .
did you close the door ?
shhhh . shhhh .
that 's a chimney swift , all right .
not by the thousands .
did you have a light burning or something .
do about what ?
just fluttering all around there .
how old is she now ?
thanks , al . we 'll be all right .
he was killed last night . by birds .
is that for mitch brenner ?
yes .
he 's not home .
monday ?
well , where did he go ?
bodega bay . he goes up there every weekend .
bodega bay ? where 's that ?
about sixty miles north of here .
sixty ... oh .
or two if you take the coast highway .
someone 's got to feed them , i suppose .
yes , someone 's got to feed them .
i wonder if you could help me .
what ?
lovebirds .
lovebirds , sir ?
no , of course not .
do you have a pair that are just friendly ?
now then , let me see .
are n't these lovebirds ?
no , sir , those are ... redbirds .
the sign says strawberry finches .
ahhh , here we are , lovebirds ...
does n't this make you feel awful ?
does n't what make me ... ?
it 's to protect the species .
especially during the moulting season .
yes , that 's a particularly dangerous time .
are they moulting now ?
some of them are .
how can you tell ?
we have some very nice canaries this week .
what did you say ?
i was merely drawing a parallel , miss daniels .
but how ... how do you know my name ?
good day , miss daniels . madam .
i do n't know you .
ahhh , but i know you .
how ?
we met in court .
we never met in court or anyplace else .
i saw you in court .
i did n't break that window !
the judge should have put you behind bars !
ahhh , but i really do want those birds .
you deliberately ...
what do you think of that , miss daniels ?
i think you 're a louse .
that was the damndest thing i ever saw .
what 's that ?
so you 're a lawyer .
what are you doing in bodega bay ?
do you practice here ?
no , san francisco . what are you ... ?
what kind of law ?
not everyone , miss daniels .
ouch !
what are you doing up here ?
besides , i was coming up anyway .
what for ?
will you please be careful ?
i 'm sorry . who 's your friend ?
why ...
yes ?
annie . annie hayworth .
well , well , small world . annie hayworth .
yes .
how do you know annie ?
we ... we went to school together . college .
deke , have you got a razor ?
oh , no you do n't !
so you came up to see annie , huh ?
yes .
you like me , huh ?
what did it say ?
i come all the way up here to ...
but you were coming up anyway , remember ?
right next to the one you already had .
yes , but ...
you are , are n't you ?
certainly , but ...
with ... with annie , of course .
besides , i can find my own way .
you wo n't hire a boat or anything ?
i 'm sure .
seven o'clock then .
i 'm glad you came . are you hungry ?
famished .
why did he shoot her ?
he was watching a ball game on television .
what ?
oh , yes .
will i be seeing you again ?
san francisco 's a long way from here .
mother tells me you like to swim .
oh . that . rome .
without any clothes on ?
sure . do you really know annie hayworth ?
so you did n't go to school together .
no .
you were lying .
yes , i was lying .
or was that a lie , too ?
i wrote the letter .
that 's what it said .
but you tore it up .
yes .
why ?
because it seemed stupid and foolish .
like jumping into a fountain in rome !
i told you what happened in rome !
do you expect me to believe ... ?
i 'd still like to see you .
why ?
but it 's not good enough now .
it is for me .
but not for me .
what do you want ?
i have to get back .
cheers .
what 's in this ? nitro-glycerin ?
what 's so important in san francisco ?
you have a job ?
i have several jobs .
what do you do ?
i do different things on different days .
at the airport .
helping travelers .
i just take it because ...
what about thursdays and fridays ?
and fridays ? what do you do then ?
nothing . i go to bird shops on fridays .
what ?
what 'll it say ?
you 'll think me very bold , sir .
are you all right ?
you look a little shaken .
last night ? what do you mean ?
mitch ... what 's happening ?
do you want some mustard with this ?
some cream ?
i 'll take cathy up to bed .
are you staying ?
really ? tell me about it .
it 's an uprising .
of birds ?
he kept saying , over and over ...
so they united .
oh yes , a few sparrows out for kicks ...
well , they 'll go along with anything .
they asked themselves .
hear !
why should we submit ourselves to their domination ?
birds of the world , unite !
take wing !
what it was , probably ...
mmm ?
it 's so damn quiet out there .
it was like that yesterday .
what do you mean ?
after the gulls attacked .
melanie , melanie ...
i 'm frightened , mitch .
no , no ...
melanie ...
will you be all right here ?
where 's cathy ?
i think it 's safe to get out now .
do n't let 's take any chances .
the town looks clear .
the bay does n't .
how long have they been gathering there ?
a little smoke over the town , but otherwise ...
do you want to try your father again ?
the phone 's dead .
have we still got power ?
where are they heading ?
inland .
santa rosa ?
when will they stop ?
i thought they 'd have stopped by now .
what time is it ?
almost two a.m .
you must be exhausted .
you 'd have been safe in san francisco .
the power .
mitch ...
we 'd better light some of those lamps .
can we turn back ?
hello , miss daniels .
you see , he has n't arrived yet .
you said three o'clock .
full grown .
and he 'll talk ?
you 'll have to teach him to talk .
yes .
i 'll call . would you mind waiting ?
let me give you my address .
could i just call ?
there we are !
that ... that ... who was that ?
have you got a pencil ?
if you 'd care to come back ...
may i use your phone ?
yes , certainly .
do you have any lovebirds ?
but i can order them for you .
would that be all right ?
is there a difference between crows and blackbirds ?
there is very definitely a difference , miss .
the crow is brachyrhynchos . the blackbird is cyanocephalus .
i do n't know about their brain pans but ...
really , let 's be logical about this .
daniels . i think they were after the children .
for what purpose ?
i do n't know why .
there 's a vast difference between ...
and what ? vultures ? hawks ? eagles ?
maybe ! is it impossible ?
sebastian , i 'm not an alarmist .
no one ever said you were , mitch .
do you believe it 's true , sebastian ?
because i ca n't see any reason for it .
is n't that a good enough reason ?
if i thought ...
if you 'll help , the rest will .
help how ? what do you want to do ?
how ?
how do you plan to do that ?
birds ?
who needs them ?
we need them .
not if they 're starting a war .
get rid of them . messy animals .
how many gulls did you count , mrs. bundy ?
you can follow me .
then let 's go . now !
i have n't finished my drink .
are you coming ?
the town was covered with seagulls .
i 'm leaving ! are you coming ?
mr. gray ?
i fear he may have to .
but ca n't you give me any idea ?
a stoke of luck one might say .
you asked to see me , ma'am ?
i want you to help my little girl .
i 'm only a student .
ask this one favor --
you have his promise , then ?
good morning , mrs. marsh .
you must leave this house .
i ca n't do that -- you heard macfarlane .
master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned .
you 're over-excited , mistress cameron .
gray ca n't threaten him with that .
you remember the trial ?
he 's not home .
where can i find him ?
he 'll welcome the ride back .
excuse me , dr. macfarlane --
dr. macfarlane --
you 're made for a doctor , young man !
i thought only the best students were made assistants .
well ? and are you not a good student ?
but richardson ?
but this woman -- and her son --
i remember her .
she feels you are her only hope .
but you did promise .
have we any `` subjects '' ?
well --
gray killed her .
we ca n't be sure of that .
i would n't report it .
i ca n't believe that .
but , i did n't ask him to kill .
she 's unconscious .
what was he laughing at ?
perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs .
i know it 's all right .
no .
what do you mean , fettes ?
what ?
they 'll be thinking of that , too .
i 've had some practice in the art .
we 'll need subjects to demonstrate . come along .
no .
where shall we put it ? in the back ?
this is not a woman !
are you a doctor , too ?
not yet .
why , yes .
hear him ?
he was a nice horse .
aye , but i still wonder how much .
you have to walk and run to find him .
i thought this was a school day .
you 'll not need that again , georgina .
i 'm by way of being a medical myself .
a doctor ?
sit down here with me .
mr. fettes and i have professional matters to discuss .
i am the best man for the job .
i 'll not do it , gray .
you 'll do it to oblige fettes and myself .
it might be an interesting case .
not at all friendly .
sit down . have a glass with me .
you know something about the human body , gray .
it 's only the dead ones that you know .
i am a doctor . i teach medicine .
did knox teach you what makes the blood flow ?
the nerve centers -- the brain --
but what makes a thought start ?
what are you holding over me ?
i 've ordered nothing from you .
this is a gift .
i take no gifts from you .
this is a gift you 'll not return .
get out of here !
have another glass of something good , toddy .
i 've drunk enough tonight .
i have other means of sustenance .
would you bribe me to leave you be ?
you 're a pleasure to me .
this wo n't be my last visit here .
i saw something . i heard .
what did you hear ?
can anyone hear what we say ?
only brother .
are n't you angry ?
dig them up ?
we will `` burke '' them ,
burke them ?
you are lately come to scotland , joseph ?
the villain burke , the meager hare -- ''
but where did they get those people ?
ah , how he cozened them .
was the paralysis immediate ?
how long after that was the paralysis complete ?
nearly a year .
any attacks of pain since ?
yes , doctor .
is her pain sporadic or constant ?
what sort of an accident was it , ma'am ?
my husband was killed and georgina was hurt .
how long ago ?
everything is in place .
she would if she could .
he 's a good lad -- bright and able .
that 's why i ask you , macfarlane .
was i not assistant to knox ?
aye --
crony indeed !
fettes -- where is fettes ?
you 're not going to gray .
you 've been with gray again .
i hate that picture .
where are they ?
a glass of water ? a transfusion ?
where are they ? last chance .
what are you doing here ?
you sent them . i had no choice .
but when she did you lost it .
you 're wrong .
was that it ? well , ok .
that he 's down here laughing ?
tell her ... we 'll get him .
check and mate .
two down . two to go .
wait , do n't tell me .
you think i 'm crazy .
i was hoping you 'd find out .
they do n't matter . i want the king .
the strip joint ?
where is it ? this place ?
i think we should get some support ?
that was a fucking hollow point !
think maybe knives do ?
keep that thing away from me .
fuck ! what do you want ?
sssshhh . she 's resting .
you lied at my trial .
i do n't know you , man .
two kids arguing . a guy and a girl .
i never held it until today .
he planted this in my car .
wrong . answer .
what did they give you ?
what scar ? what fucking scar ?
you 're dead , man !
fucking zombie .
the scar .
i heard you were looking for this .
fuck . me .
not my arm ! what you fucking want ?
i want ... to know why .
the scar . which of you has it ?
we 're going to die .
how can you die if you 're already dead ?
you 're him . corvis .
i was a friend of your sister 's .
i know her friends .
yeah , no kidding .
your father gave them to both of you .
what did you do to your face ?
you almost sound like him .
he did n't kill her .
how do you know ?
i 'll prove it to you .
daisy . how did you know ?
i told you , i knew your sister .
you killed that cop dutton .
to hide .
i 'm not hiding . i 'm right here .
i do n't know why .
he said you 'd ruin her life .
from the bonfire over there . look at it .
no ! why are you haunting me ?
this is where it happened . right over here .
no ...
erin . it 's not your fault .
oh god . i wish i were dead .
no . you do n't .
this tree . here 's where it happened .
left me with nothing .
so you 're going to kill him ?
she had a secret , would n't tell me ...
my father .
it made me crazy .
i 'm going back .
it 's ok , it 's ok ...
it 's not . i ca n't take it .
erin . who ?
... it connects you to me ...
please . at least not right away .
i thought we understood that discretion is paramount .
yeah , we do .
i know .
you know .
tommy leonard . the eyewitness in the corvis case .
there was a riot at his apartment yesterday .
guy dressed for halloween ?
they botched the execution .
could say that .
fucking crow .
how about sign of a big black bird ?
just do n't believe everything you see .
doubt is a motherfucker .
get me my kit .
because there 's a ghost threatening us .
you mean alex .
an accident , nathan .
so stop blaming me . and blame yourself .
i do . every day .
anything wrong ?
what 's with your friend there ?
actually she never had mai tais before .
but you , you 've had them .
how old are you ? fifteen ?
you want me to walk a straight line ?
i want you ... to bend over .
look , can i just call a cab ?
why are there so many ?
she 'd want it .
honey . i just ca n't .
i 'll only take a second .
erin !
he had like paint all over his face .
are you ok ?
what ? what is it ?
daisy . no one knew but us .
it still does n't mean ...
i think i dropped an earring .
you 're in with them .
it 's not what you think .
you killed her !
no .
stay away from me ! stay away !
they killed her because she found out .
about you .
sweetheart ...
never . believe me .
i do n't believe you .
please . come inside .
you should go out and see it for yourself !
thanks -- i 'm enjoying it right here .
people are running around like ants !
have they all arrived ?
they were all very curious about the meeting .
did you speak to our friend mr. carpenter ?
yes , sir -- it certainly does !
we also know that you are experimenting with rockets .
no -- not at all .
what is the alternative ?
such power exists ?
you mentioned a demonstration of force --
something that would affect the entire planet .
i 'll think of something .
maybe a little demonstration .
hi mom !
did you have a nice day , dear ?
professor barnhardt .
you can finish that in the morning .
mom -- is there something wrong with mr. carpenter ?
or a gangster ?
what are you doing up at this hour ?
i had to tell you !
right into the space ship !
now , bobby , just a minute --
and that great big iron man was moving around !
bobby , you 've been dreaming again .
you have n't even been out of the house .
yes , i have !
he gave these to you ?
oh , boy -- can i , mom ?
bobby , your shoes are soaking !
are you an fbi man ?
the space man , i guess .
he 's the greatest scientist in the world .
he lives here in washington , does n't he ?
sure . right near where my mother works .
where is that ?
i bet he could knock down a whole building .
what do you think makes it go ?
well -- atomic power , i would imagine .
i thought that was only for bombs .
you think they 'll ever find him ?
i 'm inclined to doubt it .
mr. carpenter -- what does velocity mean ?
you 're just kidding , are n't you ?
what does that mean ?
did all these people die in wars ?
did n't you ever hear of arlington cemetery ?
very far away .
do n't they have places like this ?
go to the movies .
all right .
no foolin ' ? will you ?
gee -- those look like diamonds !
why not , bobby ?
mrs. benson -- this is mr. brady .
we 'll finish it tomorrow ... goodnight , bobby .
thanks , mr. carpenter .
bobby -- have you a flashlight ?
what do you want it for , mr. carpenter ?
how old do you think he is ?
oh , i 'd say forty-five .
he 's seventy-eight .
i do n't believe it .
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty .
how does he explain that ?
we all feel --
had you been traveling long ?
about five months -- your months .
you must have come a long way .
the present situation ?
i mean the reasons for my coming here .
would you care to talk about it ?
it concerns all the people on your planet .
what about your united nations ?
lately , we 've been getting your television also .
perhaps if you could explain a little --
i 'm glad to see you up and around .
thank you ... have you any news ?
you must n't judge us too harshly .
i can judge only by what i see .
your impatience is quite understandable .
my people have learned to live without it .
it was a wonderful day .
you still have n't answered my question .
i just want to think it over .
hello --
you ready ?
i will be in just a minute .
the picture starts at eight-fifty .
oh , tom , that was awful .
but look what i found in his room
is it real ?
i wonder if we ought to --
why has n't he got any money ?
i know it 's true .
how do you know ?
are you crazy ? after what happened today ?
you do n't realize how important it is .
the point is we can do something about it .
it 's our duty to turn him in .

now will you go ?
that was a foolish thing to do .
i know .
i 'm tired of running .
once you get used to the darkness .
i do n't think that 's going to happen .
and why not ?
it 's spectacular ...
how do you keep the water temperature stable ?

i 'm sorry , david .
it hurt me , alex . very much .
i hear it from mrs. watchit every day .
hiding ?
you used to care about your work .
but you have to learn to live with it ...
i live with it every minute of every day .
i know that --
it was n't your fault , alex .
something ... extraordinary .
what is it ?
you would n't believe me .
why do n't you come to our house instead ?
i ca n't leave when i 'm so close .
that 's absurd --
good night , david .
there was an elm tree outside the window then .
this ... was my home .
i wish you the very best .
sir ... ?
did you hear me , lad ?
you 're up ! you must be feeling better --
yes .

keep the fire burning if you can .

most things . we 're very high on purpose .
or mud carriers .
what are you ?
the greatest city in the world .
you liked it there .
learning was important ?
night and day .

it sounds like a wonderful place to live .
alexander ... ?

you lost someone .
yes .
the future had to be better .
is it ?
i thank you for that .

empirical , exacting , quantifiable records .
yes , sir .
you had such a long journey .
i did ...
`` eloi '' ?
his name was moren . do you know him ?
no ...
he said he traveled for two months .
and more roads . and buildings .

feeling up to some work ?
where do they take them ? !
but they do n't come back .
what do you mean ? !
they 've gone to a better place .
you know that 's not true .
we choose to believe it .
then it 's time to change that --
my fowl have polluted the yard .
if i might explain , sir --
yes , sir .
how did you get hurt ?
kalen ...
you were bleeding all over the place !
what did you do at night ?

he 's fine . he 's narrating .
hey . what are you guys doing here ?
when 's captain nemo moving in ?
you all right , professor tripp ?
you snore .
it 's the chancellor .
thank you .
tripp !
how are you , crabtree ?
emily ?
your wife .
oh . we 're picking her up . downtown .
particularly while i 'm on my way to pittsburgh .
she 's a transvestite .
you 're stoned .
she 's still a transvestite .
mm .
i 'm just sort of ... tinkering with it .
think that might be possible ?
i 'm sort of at a critical ... juncture .
i thought you were tinkering .
i just mean ...
trip ? ?
he owed me money .
trip ? ?
she left me . crabs .
left you ... ? who ? emily ?
i found a note in the kitchen .
i lost a wife today .
is that just beer ?
you missed a few bottles , by the way .
i 'm sure . where is everyone ?
he has a book .
i know . he started it fall semester .
so . is he any good ?
no . not yet he is n't .
well , i 'm going to read it anyway .
i 'm not even sure if he 's --
he is . take my word for it .
no sexual confusion there , eh , professor ?
he 's a boxer . a flyweight .
not curtis .
he fell during a race and got trampled .
and now he 's addicted to painkillers .
he ca n't piss standing up anymore .
and his mother blames vernon for his death .
that was good .
the kid 's practically in a coma .
tripp .
yes .
what 's this guy 's problem ?
shit .
wait here . i 'll be right back .
tripp ? !
you stay there .
sometimes we have to improvise .
i mean , besides you and ... me ?
kidnapped ? by who ?
his parents .
good god . let 's go rescue him .
i do n't know where they live .
the university must know where he lives .
it 's a little late to call admissions .
is it a little late to call the chancellor ?
i feel this kid in my bones .
how bad is it for you ?
which is ?
so tell me about you and the chancellor .
what 's to tell ?
how are we supposed to find his ?
so modest .
so sensitive .
cut the kid some slack .
crabtree .
shut up , james .
so what 's the problem ?
who do you think it is ?
the chancellor 's here ? now ?
with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant .
so -- what do we do now ?
find the jacket .
want some help with that ?
so whose car is it ?
my guess -- vernon hardapple .
such as .
'that 's my car , motherfucker . '
we find the car ...
... we find the jacket .
in fact , we made the whole guy up .
christ , tripp . how did you know ?
naturally you have copies .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
look at carlyle , when he lost his luggage .
that was maccaulay .
or hemingway , when hadley lost all those stories .
he was never able to reproduce them .
kind of a sign , you 're saying .
in a sense .
the jacket , tripp . we need the jacket .
came to my senses .
i know that .
do you know he wo n't expel him ?
no . but i do n't think that matters .
me ? what can i do ?
you peeked , did n't you ?
how are you -- is it joe ?
well . 'night , jeff .
i 'll be ... somewhere else .
you driving this car ?
excuse me ?
you driving this car ?
it 's mine .
bullshit . it 's mine , motherfucker .
you must be mistaken .
i passed out .
you did .
i 've been doing that a lot lately .
how long have you been having them ?
the last month maybe .
how long have you been smoking marijuana ?
spiro t. agnew was vice president , i believe .
what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?
i 've been trying to finish a book ...
and your wife left you .
is that in my chart ?
i know .
she told you about ...
her dog , yes .
that 's a little disappointing .
better luck next time .
so is my friend ... is sara still here ?
no . there 's no one here .
vernon .
he 's got a gun .
who 's got a gun ?
drop it !
i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k .
they do n't even make the caps anymore .
and that 's a gun .
that was the only copy ?
can i ask you a question ?
right . well , thanks . for the lift .
no sweat . only do me a favor ?
sure .
hello ?
you wo n't believe what 's happened .
sara ? hi . it 's grady .
where are you , grady ? an elevator ?
you 're in kinship ?
yes . but that 's not why i called ...
with emily ?
i 'm just ... just ...
... reconcile with emily .
goodbye , grady .
no . sara , you do n't understand ...
some people carry rabbits ' feet ...
are you and hannah seeing each other , james ?
no ! what gave you that idea ?
so what was the movie you two saw ?
with tyrone power and frances farmer .
she went crazy , frances farmer .
she 's in it too .
sounds like a good one .
well ...
it only took me an hour to write .
really ? that 's remarkable .
you cold , james ?
a little .
so what are you doing out here ?
it 's colder in there .
it looks like heaven ...
heaven ?
there 's something i think you ought to see .
i 'll miss my bus .
is that really it ?
that 's really it .
the one she wore on her wedding day ?
go ahead .
really ?
they 're glass . the buttons .
it must 've cost dr. gaskell a lot .
maybe i 'm just a little sad .
hannah mentioned something about it . about a note .
you shot dr. gaskell 's dog .
i had to . did n't i ?
could n't you 've just pulled him off me ?
i did n't -- he looked -- i thought --
professor tripp ? can i ask you a question ?
yea , james .
whose tuba is that anyway ?
miss sloviak 's .
can i ask you something about her ?
have one .
no thanks . i 'm fine without them .
you guys had to carry me out .
mmhmmm ... knap ... sap ...
in the auditorium .
thank you .
i 'm okay . i just lost my balance .
i put you on the floor .
i just write in it .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
want me to get that ?
he did n't give his name .
who ?
the guy on the phone .
what 'd you tell him ?
yes .
afraid so .
washed up ?
blocked .
professor tripp ?
hm .
hannah thought you 'd like my couch .
how 's that ?
i was asked to leave .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
there is , but it 's not that interesting .
so where have you been staying ?
but james . i mean ... how long ?
for protection .
jesus , james , you should 've told someone .
who ?
is n't this ... ?
she seemed to take it pretty well .
i know what the people are like .
humboldt county ?
maybe ...
he gets it from his doctor .
glaucoma ?
colon cancer .
my parents live in a small town .
where 's that ?
carvel .
carvel ? where 's carvel ?
outside scranton .
i never heard of it .
my dad worked there for thirty-five years .
your father worked in a mannequin factory ?
before that , she 'd been a dancer .
what kind of dancer ?
when we fall , we fall hard .
what 's it called again ?
kinship .
kinship . and what 's here ?
the one that left you ?
someone jumped on your car with their butt ...
how can you tell ?
maybe she did n't come here .
and your hips are as slim as hers .
in the trunk .
it feels really ... good ... here .
i just wanted a little sip .
you 're mad at me , are n't you ?
so , why did you take me up there ?
jealous ? of me ?
you 're lying .
the hell i am .
i know it . you said so yourself .
i never said that .
i heard you myself .
i did n't mean it that way .
how 'bout cutting me some slack ?
i 'm sorry .
not to anybody . not anymore .
you coming ?
want a bite ?
no thanks .
your spells .
i do n't have spells .
what would you call them then ?
it 's because you do n't eat .
i eat .
when ?
you just worry about yourself , james . okay ?
where you going ?
i 'm not going with them .
understand ?
i remember that . five or six years ago .
six . their plane went down right outside scranton .
near carvel ?
get out of here .
professor tripp ?
professor tripp ?
i 'm a little worried , james .
professor tripp ... ?
yes , james .
yes , hannah ?
thanks for that . he all right ?
i think so ... what about you ?
me ? sure . why ?
and his friend . all right ?
by the way , his friend ... ?
james . this is my editor , terry crabtree .
i thank you .
so what are you going to do ?
but i 've never seen it .
that strikes me as odd .
he must 've left it inside .
he can crash on the sofa .
it 's the best one for naps .
last night .
hey .
crabtree ? he does n't even know james .
where did you take james that day ?
i told you , sewickly heights .
but where ? i need the street .
he cribbed that from borges .
mine 's sort of out of commission .
that good , huh ?
professor tripp .
chancellor .
i got the message you called .

a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning .
your fingerprints were all over the bedroom .
really ? that was fast .
i 'm kidding . hello ?
there is something i need to tell ...
are you limping ? why are you limping ?
did you fall somewhere ?
i do n't know whether to swoon or smirk .
but this is not just about me anymore .
i know what 's at stake here ...
and besides ... i have n't decided yet .
about the baby .
who 's that sitting in your car ?
james leer .
inside .
and the jacket ?
someone stole my car .
grady .
i parked it right there last night .
are you sure you parked it there ?
would walter really press charges ?
i think i might have .
he told you .
he told me .
and what did you say ?
i 'm so glad to see you , sara .
or is this you improvising again , grady ?
i 'm through improvising .
is it true ? did you lose it all ?
i lost it all .
oh , grady . you 're such a putz .
i know .
ouch . how many ?
i went and looked at some babies just now .
oh ?
i guess you have to go on faith .
did you tell walter ?
i told walter .
does he still love you ?
did you just make that up ?
you do n't deserve me , you know .
the more the merrier .
why yes . how did you know ?
that 's a nice greenhouse .

i need a ride .

you know anything about that ?
i was asleep .
i did n't say what time the assault occurred .
i went to bed pretty early .
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty .
i was n't feeling well .
i could take you downtown .
that 's a nasty scratch on your neck .
i have a passionate girlfriend .
what 's with the boxes ?
you 're a cop . figure it out .
i 'd say you 're moving .
the passionate one ?
yes .
then i 'd say you 're a lucky fellow .
i count my blessings .
you sure you do n't know nothing about this ?
so . how are you adjusting ?
i 'm adjusting okay .
and your new apartment ?
apartment 's okay .
are you taking your medication ?
it gives me headaches .
but you are taking it ?
sergeant lucas . may i come in ?
i 'd keep away from him .
what ?
have you seen walter ?
yeah , like the bird .
can i ask how old you are ?
i 'm twelve .
no you 're not .
walter .
do you have many friends ?
no .
it sounds like you were banished .
banished ... yeah .
robin ?
yes ?
what ?
would you like to sit on my lap ?
no thank you .
are you sure ?
i 'm sure . thank you all the same .
that 's okay ... does n't matter .
would you like me to take you there ?
they sound like finches .
my daddy lets me sit on his lap .
does he ?
yes .
what 's her name ?
ms. kramer .
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does .
i ca n't .
but you did . beautifully . i heard you .
what will happen if i do ?
but will he ... ?
your daddy will always love you .
i do n't want to hurt my daddy .
walter ?
no .
i do n't mind .
you should go home .
ca n't i stay a little longer ?
it 's getting dark . go home .
and how 's your job ?
i said the job is okay .
have you made any friends there ?
i 'm not running for mr . popularity .
you seem a little hostile today .
it 's called sarcasm , dr. rosen .
i 'm a therapist , not a psychiatrist .
what ?
i 'd like you to keep a journal .
a diary ?
that 's right .
no way .
why not ?
diaries have sent too many guys to prison .
i do n't understand .
ev-i-dence .
oh . it never crossed my mind .
of course .
it was just an idea .
bad idea .
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect .
reflect .
that 's right .
you think reflection is good .
it 's very good , indeed .
try it .
no fucking way .
how 's the journal ?
i 'm still thinking about it .
you do n't like coming here , do you ?
it 's okay .
be honest , walter .
honest ? no .
and why do n't you like coming here ?
forget it .
or the sound of my name .
i also know a therapist named chung .
how do you feel about that ?
i do n't feel anything .
you have no feelings for your niece ?
how can i have feelings ?
then why are you talking about this ?
have to talk about something .
what are you afraid will happen ?
have you talked to carlos about your concerns ?
i 'm not that crazy .
why do you think you 're here ?
it 's part of the parole deal .
is that what you are angry about ?
talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round .
how long is this going to take ?
we have a few more minutes .
i mean , when will i be normal .
we have a lot of work to do .
will i ever be normal ?
i could n't say .
you could n't say .
i 'm afraid not .
do you know what `` normal '' is ?
i suppose it 's however society defines it .
how do you define it ?
they usually tell me .
how do they know ?
what is your idea of being normal ?
why do n't we continue this on thursday .
fuck you , rosen !
i know --
you do n't know !
i do n't know .
what did you think would happen ?
i do n't know .
what did you want to happen ?
no parole , no nothing .
is this the first one ?
that 's why i 'm telling you !
walter , we 'll pick up here next time .
i want to talk about it now .
go home , walter .
you 're very late .
sorry .
please do n't do it again .
when did it all start ?
i do n't know .
that 's not a helpful answer .
close your eyes .
what ?
i 'd like you to close your eyes .
why ?
to relax .
i 'm relaxed .
close your eyes and let your mind be blank .
no , i am not going to --
nothing . can i open my eyes ?
i do n't see --
who do you see ?
what is she doing ? how old --
not so fast .
sorry . where is she ?
in my bedroom , sleeping .
where ?
where do you think ?
where are you ?
in my bed too .
how old are you and your sister ?
we 're little kids .
and what are you doing ?
just lying there . we 're taking a nap .
a nap ?
what the hell are you doing there ?
did you and your sister often take naps together ?
do n't ever do that again .
all right .
i do n't like nobody behind my back !
nothing .
did you take off your clothes ?
this is garbage !
i smelled her hair .
what else ?
i just liked smelling her hair .
you felt pleasure .
did you get an erection ?
i was six years old !
it was a small house .
a small house ... with small rooms .
i just hope ... i just want her to ...
it 's going to take time , walter .
time .
how do you feel about that ?
what ?
are you okay ?
want a ride ?
i 'm all right .
there 's something wrong with this picture .
what picture ?
i 'm talking about you .
me ?
i mean , who rides the bus anymore ?
what 's weird about that ?
most women would n't choose it .
you 're quiet at work .
i 'm just quiet .
you do n't hang out with the other guys .
neither do you .
you never spoke to me before .
are you ?
southern light .
what ?
but southern light is very good .
i 'll buy a plant .
you plan to drink both those beers ?
is that a school ?
k through sixth .
does n't it get noisy ?
i like the noise .
you must hate it .
what about bears ?
what about them ?
they could eat you .
what ?
something happened to you .
i 'm not easily shocked .
i get that impression .
so ... what 's your dark secret ?
so ?
so , you 're not a dyke .
hey , that was ... intense .
you 're still here .
i did n't say i did n't enjoy it .
sorry . i 'm such a fucking asshole .
what 's the problem ?
you think i have a problem ?
do you ?
it 's been a while since ...
tell me about it .
maybe later .
how about in the morning .
the morning ?
i thought i 'd stay the night .
did i say something wrong ?
i suffer from insomnia .
is that all ?
usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming .
hey , there .
why do you want to know ?
what 's the worst thing you ever did ?
the worst ?
so , what did you do ?
i molested little girls .
molested little girls ?
you 're not joking .
look , you can go now .
sorry .
what did you do to them ?
it 's not what you think .
how young ?
i never hurt them . never .
twelve years in prison ?
why do n't you just go now , okay ?
i told you i 'm not easily shocked .
or do you get off on this shit ?
what ?
get your kicks somewhere else .
hey , i 'm not --
depraved ? my mistake .
what was prison like ?
you do n't really --
you mean the time you 're locked away ?
i 'm sorry , walter .
i hated fishing , but i loved his stories .
i 've changed .
is it their innocence ? their beauty ? ...
their power . they seduce me .
they seduce you ?
i was always the one seduced .
you really believe that ?
that 's what i used to tell myself .
and what do you tell yourself now ?
nothing . it 's over .
you know , this is crazy .
what ?
being here , with me .
i know .
most people say the odds are against me .
what odds ?
i 'm saying there are risks ... seeing me .
you wan na talk about odds ?
i got poked around ... here and there .
which brother did this ?
all three -- in chronological order .
you must hate your brothers .
i love my brothers .
no you do n't .
you never asked them about it ?
are you serious ?
not ever ?
maybe this is n't a good idea .
what ?
you 're scared .
i 'm not scared .
neither am i .
we should live together .
live together .
it 's a bad idea .
just think about it .
i 've got problems .
who does n't ?
most people do n't have my kind of problems .
guess that makes you pretty special .
i say we call it quits .
what 's this ?
i do n't need a plant .
thank you .
do n't be scared , walter .
i 'm not scared .
do n't do that .

claudia , are n't you coming ?
i 'm certainly not going to swim across .
and how long will you be away ?
four or five days .
but how could you say such a thing ?
and have you any other truths to tell me ?
you already know what they are .
they have no sense of dignity at all .
and you say that came from lisca bianca ?
it 's the first time that ever happened .
what is that one over there called ?
at what ?
well ?
well , what ?
i think you 're very sweet , corrado .
more so than the shark ?

maybe you 'd better ask him .
do n't be so humble .
how should i be ... arrogant ?
there 's nothing much to laugh at .
shall we go for a swim ?
twelve years ... but why have n't they married ?
and why have n't they left each other ?
it could n't be that they 're in love ?

yes , very much so .
has she ever spoken to you about me ?

i 'm too sleepy .
what time do expect to get up tomorrow ?
good night , my love .
good night . tell me that you love me .
i love you .

i do n't love you .
i would say he 's pretty depraved .
have you ever been in love ?
he seems so calm .
but where did you finally end up ?
it 's divine !
you say that just to flatter me .
do you consider that a compliment ?
i 'm not coming .
should n't we try to find a quieter place ?
you always said people bore you .
what do you mean by sensible ?
patrizia ... patrizia ... where 's ettore ?
i imagine he must be inside sleeping .
patrizia , i 'm afraid .
especially at night .
you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything .
who are you talking to ?
please , you come too ...
is that clear ?
it 's as smooth and slick as oil .
what happened ?
do n't move from where you are !
i 'll stay here also .
and what did you have to eat ?

where is she going ?
you men are all so dreadful !
and , what do you know -- he paints .
giulia ...
and where do you find the models ?
oh , there are as many as one wants .
it 's almost a natural inclination .
i could n't .
why do n't you try ?
do n't you ever paint men ?
i 'll paint you a beautiful portrait .
you appeal to me more .
is that right ?
yes , sir . three times .
what have you got to say about that ?
does she work in catania ?
yes , she takes care of the garden .
we have a radio like this , too .

but where did you come from ?

and how come you 're up so early ?
patrizia , what are you going to do ?
but we 'll do something .
in fact , ettore should already be there .
why do n't you two go upstairs and change ?
did you manage to find good rooms ?
they did n't seem too good .
he always manages to get what he wants .
ettore must be fed up with me by now .

are they treating you all right ?
you got married to god .
marie 's dead mama .
who are you ?
how do you survive ?
do you have field hands that help you ?
oh that one there , in the corner .
the one up on the third floor ?
yes .
no .
who told you this ?
do you still go to church ?
but it does make all the difference to agnes .
are you expecting me to.. ?
yes ... i ...
you can call me sister .
... thank you .
you were a smoker ?
two packs a day .
i can beat that .
who knew about agnes ' pregnancy ?
no-one .
how did she hide it from the other nuns ?
she undressed alone ... she bathed alone .
is that normal ?
yes .
her pregnancy fell in between the doctor 's visits .
who was the father ?
i have n't a clue .
what man had access to her ?
none as far as i know .
was there a priest ?
yes , but i ...
could there have been anyone else ?
obviously there was .
do you think she 'd admit to the conception ?
look , someone gave her the baby .
not you personally ...
the science of psychiatry .
i am not with the inquisition .
what 's your opinion ?
i believe agnes is different .
yes i ... i 've noticed .
that 's ridiculous ...
so , someone else could have done it .
no ... not in the eyes of the police .
and in your eyes ?
i 've already told you what i thought .
it 's possible is n't it ?
that 's absurd !
that possibility never occurred to you ?
maybe agnes went to him .
shortly after she came to us .
and you were n't shocked ?
i was appalled , just as you are now .
and what happened ?
this was before her pregnancy ?
she could have bled to death .
she does n't deserve that .
not simple , no .
do you think hysteria could do that ?
that 's her innocence . she belongs to god .
you hate us do n't you ?
what ?
nuns ... you hate nuns .
i hate ignorance and stupidity .
i 'm only interested ...
? ? ?
then help her .
i am ...
let her face the world .
there 's another choice .
what ?
aquittal .
how ?
all right , what do you need .
when would agnes have conceived the child ?
oh , some time in january .
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ?
earthquakes ?
visitors to the convent .
yes .
there 's nothing here .
was the child full term ?
oh , dear god ...
what is it ?
the sheets ...
what sheets ?
when was that ?
sister paul ?
you lied to me
about what ?
like keeping her home from school ?
yes .
listening to angels ?
that 's what killed her .
do you know what she did to her ?
i do n't think i care to know .
she molested her !
lots of dirty little secrets .
oh god , if only i 'd known .
you knew she was an alcoholic .
i knew that after the fact .
why did n't you do anything to stop her ?
because i did n't know ...
and my permission ?
we 'll see about that .
do n't deny it !
i have n't decided yet .
the woman 's health is at stake .
because i am a moral person .
bullshit !
bullshit yourself !
catholic church does n't have a corner on morality ...
who said anything about the catholic church ...
nothing ...
stupid woman ... and that 's all ?
she was a beautiful little girl .
and what has that to do with it ?
does my smoking bother you ?
no , it reminds me .
would you like one ? huh ?
i 'm out of prac ... ... practice .
all right ?
and of course
hand rolled .
even christ would partake socially .
saint peter ?
pipe !
right ...
mary magdelen ?
oh , you 've come a long way baby .
what do you suppose today 's saints are smoking ?
do you think they ever existed ?
yes i do .
do you want to become one ?
do you think agnes is still attached to god ?
listen to her singing .
i 'd like to begin .
begin what ?
the hypnotism . do you still disapprove ?
would it stop you if i did ?
may i be present ?
of course .
we 're taking you off the case .
you 're what ?
we 'll find our own , thank you .
for the church ?
for agnes .
you think she 's a saint ?
she 's been touched by god , yes .
give me a miracle .
the father !
who is he ?
why must he be anybody ?
how ?
do n't be ridiculous .
well give me a reasonable explanation
she is an innocent .
the sum of her psychological parts ?
that 's what i have to believe ...
that 's how she got out .
how could she find out about it ?
somebody told her .
oh , would you stop lying mother !
why would i lie ?
i 'm concerned about her health .
this is permission to take her apart .
where is she ?
has n't she had enough ?
i have a few more questions to ask her .
who knew she was pregnant ?
why do you insist upon pressing ...
was it you ?
is it because she 's a nun ?
did you know she was pregnant ?
yes .
and you did n't send her to a doctor .
i did n't guess until it was too late .
for what ? an abortion ?
oh , do n't be ridiculous .
the baby ?
she did n't want any help .
you wanted that child out of the way .
that 's a lie .
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room .
and the baby .
no !
i doubt that 's what she 'd say .
that 's enough .
agnes , what happened to the baby ?
she ca n't remember .
oh , do n't do this !
so , i took them under me managerial banner .
lay them down .
eh ?
lay them down .
we 'd be thrown out .
they 're yours .
they are ?
have you got a licence for it ?
oh do n't be so stroppy !

locked .
engines off .
maybe we 'll be able to see something then .
... i do n't know ...
do you remember the pyramid ?
where 's irth ?
i do n't recognize that constellation .
i got it . oh boy .
where the hell are we ?
can you get it a little closer ?
any rotation ?
yeah . two hours .
gravity ?
i want to see what this place looks like .
activate lifter quads .
flat . it 's totally flat . a plain .
is it solid ?
it 's ... basalt . rock .
then take her down .
close enough to walk to !
i 'm sending . do you hear me ?
looks like a derelict .
i 'll go first .
just machinery .
this is chaz .
can you come topside for a minute ?
there 's something i think you ought to see .
what is it ?
look there , on that screen .
maybe we can get in by the top .
you want to try ?
are you okay in there ?
how do you feel , dell ?
wretched . what happened to me ?
do n't you remember ?
what 's wrong ?
what conditions are you talking about ?
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin .
a transmission ?
i have recorded the transmission .
computer , what language was that ?
computer : have you attempted to analyze the transmission ?
i have interrupted the course of the voyage .
yes !
what 's wrong ?
how long to fix ?
hard to say .
well , get started .
hello , faust !

dead .
we were completely unprepared .
what the hell 's going on ?
do n't know -- broussard got hurt somehow .
oh -- god -- oh --
oh , no . oh , no .
and then we run out of food and oxygen .
the food storage room on one end --
we overheated and burned out a whole cell .
jay ... how 's it coming on the repairs ?
and when will you be ready to do that ?
oh -- i 'm not near ready yet .
then why the hell are you sitting around here ?
it 's really on there tight .
hey , guess what ?
what ?
might even incinerate the damn thing .
what 's going on ?
i 'll go get it .
right .
blood 's thoroughly oxygenated .
things are different here .
at least right now it 's keeping him alive .
god , that smoke 's poisonous !
it 's over , hunter .
hey now , what is this ?
there . should be coming through about there .
the rest of you continue .
the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous .
it 's dead .
now we 're in for it .
yes ?
how 's broussard ?
he 's running a fever .
still unconscious ?
yes .
can you do anything for him ?
his vital functions are strong .
give it a hell of a shock .
sounds like a rough one .
we 've got six hours left .
oh my god .
< u > how < /u > ?
the flamethrower needs more fuel .
should we go outside and bring him in ?
i 'm not getting anything .
the flamethrower !
now what 's wrong ?
i 've completely lost their signal .
can you get them back ?
what ? what was that ?
i think we should go after them .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
we 're not going anywhere .
they could be in danger right now .
that 's why chaz left us on board .
why , you chickenshit bastard --
they 're back on my screens !

oh no .
look at that .
what 's happening up here ?
this is horrible .
what common objects ?

halfway across creation ...
i 've seen it happen .

this is an opportunity which may never come again .
that tube must be depositing it in him .
we do know that .

only one of us could survive .

'bout five minutes .
give me a yell is something happens .
hello , there . who are you ?
she asked me to see who it is ...
how do you know my name ?
it 's a very famous name , mr. dewitt .
and what is your name ?
phoebe .
phoebe ?
i call myself phoebe .
may i come in ?
you 're more than modest .
i just do n't try to kid myself .
however , if i may a suggestion ...
if we do n't blow them - who will ?
it 'll be forgotten tomorrow .
i 'm less than nobody .
or should i pretend i 'm busy ?
i 'll want to do a column about you-
i 'm not enough for a paragraph .
that 's right .
was it - the shubert ?
yes . the shubert .
eddie ...
we 'll make this a special night ...
you take charge .
hungry ?
just some coffee .
after all that humble pie ...
karen and i had a nice talk .
just like that , eh ?
i do n't think that 's funny .
what a day - what a heavenly day ...
d-day .
to come and go ...
are you that sure of tomorrow ?
are n't you ?
all paved with diamonds and gold ?
you know me better than that .
paved with what , then ?
what time ?
you could sleep , too , could n't you ?
why 'd call me a killer ?
are n't you being extravagant ?
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian .
we 're having everyone up after the performance .
we 're ?
addison ...
i did n't mean just the theater .
lloyd . still just the theater , after all ...
but i do know you .
i 'm in love with lloyd !
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america-
you have no right to say such things !
... and karen .
he never went home ...
you sat and talked until it was light ...
least of all - yours .
i never intended you to be .
it 's important that i-
killer to killer .
champion to champion .
what do you mean by that ?
what have you got to do with it ?
because after tonight , you will belong to me .
i ca n't believe my ears ...
a dull cliche .
it is gertrude slescynski .
what of it ?
they have n't heard from you for three years ...
she was a liar , she was a liar !
no-no-no ...
then say so .
yes , addison .
not possibly . i could n't go on ...
i do n't suppose there 's a drink left ...
you can have one at max 's .
i do n't think i 'm going .
why not ?
it 's for this .
it 's the same thing , is n't it ?
take it to the party instead of me .
i 'm tired . i want to go home .
maybe somebody 's name is butler ...
an idiotic one , but a point .
let 's go sit by the piano .
we never met . that 's why .
until now we have met only in passing ...
go do yourself some good .
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits ?
feeling better , my dear ?
do they have auditions for television ?
this answer satisfies me a hundred percent .
too many taxi drivers write plays .
she was magnificent .
then you 've heard too .
i was there . an eyewitness .
at the play - last night ?
margo .
margo ? lunching in public ?
what are you doing here ?
you remember miss caswell ?
you 've heard of her great interest in the theater-
we have that in common .
she is in safe hands .
the ladies ' - shall we say - lounge ?
being violently ill to her tummy .
the audition is over .
i promised max .
it is now nearly four .
who ?
eve harrington .
eve ! my understudy ...
did n't you know ?
of course i knew .
how ... how was miss caswell ?
frankly , i do n't remember .
just slipped your mind .
eve harrington will be among them ...
i take it she read well .
how nice .
in time she 'll be what you are .
bill !
huh ?
you 've already met .
where ?
right here . a minute ago .
good luck , genius ...
nothing ?
not ready yet , looking like a junk yard-
have you no human consideration ?
only in some ways . you 're prettier ...
the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
the world we live in ...
ca n't keep his eyes off my legs .
she 's quite a girl , that what's-her name ...
bill ...
huh ?
do n't get stuck on some glamour puss-
and cut that out right now .
am i ?
knit me a muffler .
what a thoughtful , ever-lovin ' thing to do-
bill ? have i gone crazy , bill ?
you 're my girl , are n't you ?
that i am ...
then you 're crazy .
sing it ?
bill ... bill , it 's your birthday .
many happy returns of the day ...
yeah ... i will .
how is eve ? okay ?
okay .
i love you ...
i 'll check with eve ...
what ?
i love you too . good night , darling-
it 's a good thought .
happy little housewife ...
cut it out .
need any help ?
or is n't it a story for grownups ?
i thought you were going to be late-
when i 'm guest of honor ?
she 's a girl of so many interests .
it 's a pretty rare quality these days .
she 's a girl of so many rare qualities .
so she seems .
twenty minutes !
for instance what ?
i 'm too mad-
- guilty .
thank you .

what a body , what a voice .
no body , no voice , all mind !
the fight 's over . calm down .

you 're being terribly tolerant , are n't you ?
i 'm trying terribly hard .
and i will not be plotted against !
out of nowhere - gives a performance !
i am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts !
i do n't even know what it means ...
it 's obvious you 're not a woman .
i 've been aware of that for some time .
well , i am .
i 'll say .
do n't be condescending .
margo , let 's make peace .
the terms are too high . unconditional surrender .
is n't that enough ?
i wish it were .
to find eve ?

a cowboy .
a married lady .
with the paper to prove it .

i just wondered .
just wondered what ?
why .

why you have to go out there .
i do n't have to . i want to .
is it the money ?
eighty percent of it will go for taxes .
i just asked a simple question .

every day .

everything .
do n't run away , bill .
from what would i be running ?

i 'm for it .
your make-up 's a little heavy .
- and for you .
you 're quite a girl .

you hear all kinds of things .
and i 'm as curious as the next man ...
lem me fix you a drink .
margo does not play a lunatic , birdie .

but she just got here ...
it 's only a fur coat ...
it was fort sumter they fired on-

she 's loyal and efficient-
you all put together ?
what about the food ?
he 's late .

who are you ?
miss harrington ...

it was for my report .

i might .
the maid 'll fix it in the morning .
i 'll just pick up the broken glass .
subway .
you wo n't get home till all hours .
that 's the door .
why should you think i would n't be ?
i 'm the lowest form of celebrity ...

he 's the best .
just huddle in that doorway and wait ?
oh , no . i see the play .
i 'm going to take you to margo ...
oh , no ...
i mean , looking like this .
what 's your name ?
i thought you 'd forgotten about me .

you 're not going , are you ?
i hope i see you again soon-
i 'll be at the old stand , tomorrow matinee-
not just that way . as a friend ...
mrs. richards .
no , i could n't possibly ...
the show must go on .
do you think miss channing would approve ?
i think she would cheer .
but mr. richards and mr. sampson-
of course .
you wo n't forget it ?
what we talked about before ?
we 're having lunch with a movie talent scout .
i was wondering whether you 'd come at all..
i do n't expect you to be pleasant .
i do n't intend to be .
and none of it is easy .
there ca n't be very much-
and the disgrace .
eve ... do n't cry .
i 'm not crying .
but the raves about your performance-
- an understudy 's performance .
you were my friends ...
i 'll never get over it .
i wish i could believe that .
i think i know ...
something most important you can do .
it 's my part now .
you talk just as addison said you did .
addison wants me to play it .
over my dead body ...
congratulations , eve .
hello , miss harrington .
yes . i 've seen every performance .
how 'd hear about it ?
'footsteps on the ceiling ' .
it 's been a real pleasure , eve .
there are other plays ...
did you see it here in new york ?
well - if i 'm not in the way ...
the curtains . i made them myself .
is there anything more you 've thought of- ?
there 's the script to go back to the guild-
oh , golly . and i forgot to tell you-
if you 'd like .
is there anything else i can do ?
good evening , mr. dewitt .

harrington .
how much time have we ?
roughly ten minutes .
how far to the station ?
do you want it on ?
it does n't matter .
karen . i have n't been pleasant this weekend .
we know you too well ...
i wish someone would tell be about me ...
you 're margo . just - margo .
what about bill ?
what about bill ?
why should he - and why should you ?
and what 's left will be ... what ?
bill is all of eight years younger than you .
i 've seen it happen too often .
not to you . not to bill .
i 've acted pretty disgracefully toward her , too .
about what ?
i just ca n't believe it .
with tears ?
with tears .
check .
i remember .
how was the concert ?
now let 's not get into a big hassle-
coming ?
lloyd , what happened ... ?
of all the star ridden , presumptuous , hysterical-
margo , again ...
two hours late for the audition , to begin with-
it 's just possible she did n't ...
sensitive , understanding , young , exciting , vibrant-
margo has n't done badly by it .
it 's going to be a cozy weekend .
what is ?
bill , margo , you and i ...
what time is it ?
lloyd , be careful ...
tell max i want to be buried with royalties ...
where 'd you get all that information ?
eve .
i 'm beginning to catch up .
if we could cast it properly , that is ...
she apologized , did n't she ?
for a bottle of wine .
i 'm glad bill 's back .
such as ?
well of all-
- well ? what happened ?
what 'd you say ?
what 's so funny ?
who is it ? what 's it all about ?
and a phobia against truth !
that was way back ...
how about calling it a night ?
that quality of quiet graciousness ...
what has or is about to happen ?
where is she ?
who 's left out there ?
a movie star from hollywood .
when you do , let me in on it .
how 's the new one coming ?
the play ? all right , i guess ...
she 's - still a girl of twenty ?
how do you mean ?
do n't be evasive .
margo , you have n't got any age .
she 's your understudy .
you were about to tell me about eve ...
you 'd have been proud of her .
i 'm sure .
she was a revelation ...
to you , too ?
that 's beside the point .
playing that childish game of cat and mouse ...
karen and i just do n't want an accident-
i have no intention of having an accident !
that depends .
i mean really , deeply angry ...
i do n't think i could be .

rath . robert rath .

where you wanted to be ?
you are nothing .
the c.i.a . ?

how old were you ?
they recruited me when i was in high school .
jesus -- why ?
languages . i was already fluent in nine languages .
you were like a boy genius ?
some people said that . i never thought so .
why not ?
i was just different .
you went from high school to the agency ?
no , they did n't .
but you knew what they were training you for ?
i was going to be james bond .
ahhhh ...
the training , the weapons , the travel --
the exotic women .
women ? no ... not really .
why not ?
i do n't want to talk about women .
why ?
because you are a women .
why did you leave the agency ?
they tried to kill you ?
tell me about the first time .
my first take ?
yes .
why ?
because i want to know .
are they usually like that ?
no . just the first one .
after that ?
they become complicated ... messy .
did it ever bother you ?
did it ever bother james bond ?
that 's fiction .
no one is innocent -- including you !
something cold blooded ... something remorseless ...
for all i know it could be a machine .
you said you did n't trust it .
do you have a passport ?
several .
good .
where is it ?
hey , where are you ?
thinking .
about ?
is it as nice as they say ?

not even a stalemate ?
no .

sorry .
how was the beach ?
where did you learn it ?
thank you .
i 've always wanted to learn something like that .
two way ?
transmits and receives .
i paid a lot for these .
if i had known we 'd be using --
okay ? we 'll have to deal with these .
in the morning i will enter the bank .
but he wo n't shoot you right then ?
okay . then what ?
then , we wait .
why wo n't he wait until the bank closes ?
that means you wo n't have a gun .
we split the money ?
except --
i mean , you 're not him .
for nicholai ?
yes .
what is going on here ?
that 's it .
i do n't believe that .
ten years ago .
yes .
to disappear to some empty greek island .
what did he say ?
that no one wins at this game .
you did n't take it .
i went back to the hotel . and waited .
ten years later , here you are again .
do you have ulcers ?
no .
i think i got one today .
why did you trade a bishop for a knight ?
they 're useless . i like knights .
they 're worth less points .

nobody ever sees me .

thank you .
does n't it seem so crazy ?
no .
no ?
the world has always functioned on two levels .
i know . it makes me crazy .

what ?
that 's a ridiculous move .
why ?
because , i 'll take it .
can i ask you something ?
i 'm sure you will .
yes .
are you attracted to me ?
yes .
why ?
i did n't want to complicate the situation .
attraction is a complication ?
it can be .
it happened to you before ?
yes .
who was she ?
someone like me , like you . a pro .
what happened to her ?
she was taken .
did you --
i tried to stop it . i could n't .
it 's dangerous to let things become complicated .
is this becoming complicated ?
were you attracted to me right away ?
no .
when did it start ?
honestly ?
maybe you should see a psychiatrist .
why ?
that does n't sound normal .
i 'm not normal .
martin .
four minutes .
what ?
i waited another four minutes .
shit .
wait until he is on the stairs .
right .
i 'm taking off my mike .
okay .
electra --

all the time .
then , i 'll sail alone .
is that all you want ?
thank you .
how much farther ?

i never would though . not really .

only family can be trusted .
uncle alfred ?
in spirit only , i 'm afraid .
my sincerest apologies , sir .
well , i hope you 'll stay with us .

it 's good to see you .
what seems to be the problem ?

oxbridge academy ?

please be looking for me .
i did n't need your help .

why would you need a few hundred dollars ?
you would n't understand .
what are you talking about ?
alfred 's happy here .
what the hell is attack plan alpha ?
youwsa ! nothing but air .
this is easy .
crimefighter 's rule number one : never say that .
crimefighter 's rule number two .
i 'm afraid to ask .
pow ! what ! kazow !
what exactly are you doing ?
damn ? damn is not good .
do n't squander your genius on evil .
you 're loosing your cool
just as you killed my wife .
nice suit . and today you are ?
... a giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
mr . freeze .
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum .
the second sun of the sudan .
he 's going to steal the giant white diamond .
watch the first step .
you think freeze will take the bait ?
three million - -
pull back . you ca n't make the jump .
but then ...
this is one majorly beautiful evil person .
i 'm totally over her . positively .
me too . great stems , though .
umm-hmmmm .
how did you ... ?
can he save her ?
no beauty ...
toxins introduced through the mouth .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm betting her lips are poison .
we got ta get those locks changed .
she knows who we are .
i guess we 'll just have to kill her .
no sign of the snowman .
if we could relay the sunlight-
dr. pamela isley .
a research grant ? a hospital wing ?
your arboreal preservation project in south america .
dr. woodrue was a lunatic .
i see you knew him .
millions would die of cold and hunger alone .
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet .
how do you explain your behavior ?
no ! ?
and ?
you 're not even listening to me .
there are things about me you would n't understand .
that you 've had a your wild nights .
i would n't bet on that .
who 's ivy ?
what ?
you just called me ivy . who 's ivy ?
if you're..um ... free ... this evening .
make a choice , bruce . her or me .
well ... um ... her .
that 's got ta hurt .
what happened to his wife ?
you see a pattern here ?
i need the wayne diamonds .
we gon na trap ourselves a snowman ?
it wo n't happen again .
you could have been killed .
i got the diamond . quell problemo , bruce ?
and i ca n't deal with it .
but he 's never said a word-
and i 've never told him .
that 's what freeze 's wife had .
it just does n't say how .
no one else is even close .
then i go after freeze and ivy . alone .
like hell you do .
dick , do n't push me right now .
do n't you ? answer me , damn it !
you 're not thinking straight .
that 's no batlight , it 's a birdcall .
she must have stolen his keys , altered the signal-
for love .
she 's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
i 'm under some magic spell ?
so i 'm here to set you free .
but what does the lady want in return ?
i must have the gems that power my suit .
trust me . vegetable magnetism .
she 's frozen in -
you will rescue my wife
make yourself right at home .
where is my wife ?
batman deactivated her . she 's dead .
their blood will freeze in my hands .
first gotham and then the world .
inspired , ms. ivy .
winter has come at last .
freezy , i 'm feeling ... hot .
there is little perfection in that .
what say we turn up the heat ?
my passion thaws for my bride alone .
these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite .
give it up . if you threw yourself-
i ca n't breathe without you .
i need a sign .
how about dangerous curves ?
of trust . tell me your plan .
kiss me and i 'll tell you .
i 've got to stop him .
it 's time to die , little bird .
what do you mean ?
these lips can be murder .
then you never loved me ?
you 're too late . say bye-bye birdie .
he cut the funding for our work -
you look great . especially for a dead woman .
the dreams again , sir ?
i think they 're getting worse .
then you 'd have nothing to complain about .
scholarly research ?
i wonder if she 'd go out with me .
your parents ' wake . rain fell like tears .
suddenly gone . so much loss ...
alfred ? how many rooms ? total ?
ninety-three , including the sauna .
a scream . two gunshots . i killed them .
what did you say ?
two-face . he slaughtered that boy 's parents .
no . you said i. i killed them .
i have some rather distressing news about master dick .
is he all right ?
i 'm afraid master dick has ... gone traveling .
he ran away ?
actually , he took the car .
he boosted the jag ? is that all ?
not the jaguar . the _other_ car .
the _rolls_ ?
he 's protecting more than industrial secrets , alfred .
maybe they 're right .
which `they ' might that be , sir ?
why do i keep doing this ?
why , indeed ?
have a life . friends . family ...
perhaps not . why not ask the lady ?
how are you feeling , young man ?
old habits die hard . are you alright ?
give me the bad news .
it 's like the life of a stranger .
perhaps the fall ...
there 's one other thing . i feel..
what ?
... afraid .
... a bat .
what ?
chasing me . oh my god , alfred .
master , bruce ?
what do they mean ?
what do maniacs always want ?
recognition , of course .
letters in the alphabet .
of course . 13 is m ... .mre .
how about , mr. e .
mystery .
and another name for mystery ?
enigma .
what now sir ?
but it has n't yet been tested .
welcome , master grayson . i 'm alfred .
how ya doin ' , al ?
al ?
what 's back there ?
up here , al .
just checking , young sir .
_two_-face resist ?
i read your work .
you might have some interesting insights into two-face .
bats are n't rodents , dr. meridian .
he 's home . i sent the signal .
what 's wrong ?
a girl can not live by psychoses alone .
chicks love the car .
now black rubber .
try a fireman . less to take off .
we all wear masks .
you are direct , are n't you ?
i have n't had much luck with women ...
help chase . i 'll be back .
how 's tricks ?
this is one giant death trap .
wait . i have a riddle for you .
for _me_ ? really ? tell me .
what am i ?
oh please . you 're blind as a bat .
mr ... ?
and you are ?
but what exactly is on your mind ?
keep up the good work .
wait . you ca n't go .
we 'll talk some other -
so glad you could come .
what ? oh , it 's very impressive .
to your charms . skol .
nostrovia .
la'chiem .
slanta .
rinka .
how can i help you , mr. wayne ?
psychiatrists make you nervous ?
just ones this beautiful .
does it ever shut off ?
still play with dolls , doctor ?
need one ?
this letter writer is a total wacko .
so , this riddler , he 's dangerous ?
what do you know about obsession ?
it 's a stretch but i 'll manage .
his only escape may be ...
to kill me .
you understand obsession better than you let on .
oops . times up .
that 's usually my line .
look , i 'd love to keep chatting-
excuse me .
i 'm surprised you are n't blind by now .
like normal folks .
that kid is amazing .
i do n't get you bruce wayne .
but ...
well , i met someone ...
i think he felt it too .
he sure did .
what ?
who 's your decorator ? u-haul ?
at least accepted them ... .
and now ... .
why do you do that ?
what ?
if you 're jealous ...
and that side we keep in shadow .
your fees are a little rich for me .
touchy , touchy .
so how goes your `scholarly ' pursuit of batman ?
oh god , bruce . you 're still jealous .
and the beast slouches towards bethelem .
it 's ... well , we.. i ...
relax . try to remember- .
i do n't want to remember !
i 'm falling ...
what does the book say ?
i don't- .
it was my fault . i killed them .
you were n't responsible .
... not the bat ?
what are you talking about ?
okay . i 'm outta here .
then i 'm going to kill him .
it 'll make it worse .
i need to be part of this .
now i can pay him back .
back off , man .
what the hell did you think you were doing ?
what 's a good side kick name ?
how about richard grayson , college student ?
you 're going away to school .
you can't- .
trust me . i know .
there are monsters out there . gotham needs us .
otherwise ... it 's a curse .
bruce , you ca n't .
chase ?
edward ...
who is it ?
chase . do you remember me ?
how could i forget ?
dr. burton tells me you know who batman is .
who is the batman , edward ?
ca n't tell if you do n't say please .
his project was terminated this morning ...
charming . but for the lonely , the ...
paranoid ? the psychotic ?
huh , fred ?
i 'll show you it works .
you understand ? ! fired ! !
_we_ sure are .
... you gon na kill me ?
i got family . ... please .
... or death .
please . i swear i wo n't say noth-
is that better ?
uh , yeah . thanks , mr..uh ... face .
wait ! you said you 'd let me go !
but you pull it off nicely .
a man with a death wish .
holy shit .
no . wait ...
where are you sending batboy this time ?
then ... damn . hit us again .
j'ai gache ma vie ... woah . harsh toke .
oh my god . jim morrison was right .

time 's up , laughing boy .
go ahead . you can say it .
we truly want to dust him bad .
a-14 .
b-12 .
a hit .
how high up would you say that is ?
which bathroom is that , sir ?
yes ?
alexander knox . gotham globe .
mr. wayne is out for the day .
he asked me to convey his regrets .
everything 's under control .
where 's the boy ?
upstairs . he 's quite docile .
like your boyfriend . he 's kinda hot .
what are you talking about ?
i bet we would have got on famously .
... murderer ...
get in the car ! !
look ! police !
i know . i called them .
what about the girl ?
ca n't we --
how much do you weigh ?
... not even a 'thank you ' ?
i 'll have to ask you for that film .
please .
and you were as good as dead . so --
and i 'm keeping those pictures .
thank you , vicki .
... how long have i been out ?
quite a while . i took the scenic route .
what is this stuff ? kevlar ?
better . it 's not on the market yet .
how 'd you find this place ?
they 're afraid of the lights .
i loathe bats .
what is that ?
the joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source .
we 'd all be dead .
is this what you wanted ?
you could 've killed the joker .
alexander knox .
i quite like it .
-- that felt redundant .
i can take you off the streets for good .
what is it you want ?
and i want you to stay away from vicki .
not while the joker 's still at large .
do you want a drink ?
as far as i know .
do you sail ?
have you ever seen combat ?
no .
odd desire for a woman , i guess .
odd desire for anyone .
i would n't look away .
what did you see ?
i 'm half drunk and you 're not even --
i 'll take you home if you 'd like .
as an experiment .

and i do n't mind .
the divorce , i mean .
no .
do you ever regret not having a family ?
what about other people ?
i told you , i love other people .

i 'm sure he 'll be heartbroken .
be careful . there were people in that crosswalk .
have you got to tell her your life story ?
i 'll say what i fucking please .
what if they do question the authenticity ?
seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise .
who 's on the phone ?
what was that for ?
you could 've made me lose my call .
i did n't hurt you .
i 'm trying to help somebody . okay ?
it took six stitches .

theo wants to talk again .

what 'd you do ? tail me from brentwood ?
let 's have your license , mister .
what 's this ?
lady , do n't let him do it !
sit down where you are . arms folded .
or relieve me of it later .
how do we get back to the freeway ?
you do n't know what hit you .
i told you i should 've cuffed him .
he 's seen both of us now .
i 'm going to cuff you .
we ca n't have marks on his wrists .
you never miss a trick .
you switched license plates ?
i heard you were a hitter .
bullshit .
that 's your `` rep . ''
is the man a lunatic or what ?
just like they say ; no fucking self control .
if you know that just back off .
there 's the hotel . you overshot the driveway .
and stop with the directions .
make a `` u '' and go back .
i improved on the fucking original .
got your badge ?
i thought you said you could handle him .
nels , do n't let that cop pass you .
pop a cap in him .
toss him in that drainage ditch .
are you there yet ?
any minute .
do i know you ?
you do n't understand .
and i 've got no time to screw around .
will you let me explain !
and what 're you whispering for ?
lady , try making some sense .
just pick my number out of the air ?
who smashed the phone ?
they 're holding my husband downstairs .
and they left you upstairs to make phone calls ?
my name is --
i do n't want to know --
i realize you do n't want to be involved .
you 'll get someone else . good luck .
you wo n't disconnect .
oh wo n't i ?
because you know you 'll be killing us .
do n't lay this on me !
why would anybody want to hurt you ?
where 'd they take you to ?
we 've seen their faces .
and when elliot was reaching for his license --
who ?
it was so quick .
do n't go through that tunnel .
there 's no place to turn .
please .

hello ? i 'm here .
i ca n't even take a deep breath .
i 'm with two friends now .

`` theo ? ''
where 's this school located ?
why is n't anyone answering me ?
will you please speak to me ! theo ?
hello ? it 's just me and you again .
what about the others ?
they were getting on my nerves .
what are you doing now ?
forget about us . just save rachel .
the man driving the car must have a gun .
must be in her car , dammit .
how much time do you have left on it ?
a woman ?
`` click . '' you do n't exist .
and that was the end of it ?
what do you do for a living ?
sometimes i paint .
our house always needs touching up .
pictures .
you 're an artist .
just name any reasonable amount and it 's yours .
it 's just the way i am .
a price on everything .
i do n't think i was .
i 'm about ten blocks from the school .
i 've never thought of anybody but myself .
that makes two of us .
hang on . it 'll clear up .
make a right . you ca n't miss it .
i 'm getting out .
i can hear you again , clearly .
does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail ?
does she wear glasses ?
no .
what 's happening ?
she 's gone --
do n't alarm them . just go !
the one in brentwood .
what bank ?
wait just a minute . our luck has changed .
what do you mean ?
what 's the matter ?
even if you found us -- what then ?
if anybody shows up i could follow them .
not a chance .
do n't say that .
do you know what 's in that box ?
i do it all the time .
i 'm pretty good at signatures myself .
why ca n't i do anything to stop them ?
why 's all this money stashed ?
to hide it from the i.r.s .
how come everybody turns out to be a crook ?
do n't talk . do n't talk !
what 's going on ?
there 's a different car starting .
braided hair -- very dark .
for the way you feel about your family .
i 've let him make her like that .
did you jiggle the phone ?
no .
did you hear that click ?
yes -- i think so . another crossed line ?
or somebody else there is listening in --
there must be an extension . oh my god --
they 're coming upstairs . they know !
yes ? yes ?
courtesy of star 69 . are you hurt ?
i thought they were going to kill me .
lucky for them they did n't .
transplant ended up under the wheels of a chevy .
thank you . god bless you for helping us .
are you okay ?
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles .
that 's coming off . how about the girl ?
i do n't want to think about it .
your husband ?
i never heard jack cry before --

no discussion . no hesitation .

i ca n't do it .
is the tape off ?
yes .
can you walk ?
but i want rachel to come with me .
and you have to be first .
why ca n't it be her ?
she might just run .
rachel -- oh my god .
it 's locked .
i could see it in her eyes .
none of us will .
now i have -- it 's a long story .
why did n't you just shoot them ?
so do n't get any ideas .
so far they 're keeping their part of it .
her mother wants to talk to her .
he had a gun . i have it now .
you 're not lenore oberfeld .
there is n't any such person .
whose money is this ?
the guy with the transplant .
jack oberfeld in person . did you kill him ?
you timed that beautifully .
they always pick rachel up early on thursday .
i could 've kept going !
why pick me to be your `` mark ? ''
nobody 's easier to con than a con man .
who 's in back ?
l.a.p.d .
pick it up and say hello .
you have to deal with us .
do you have to point that ?
he seems to be headed for topanga .
all i did i was put him there .
a typical fuck-up .
you were at the emerald that night ?
you could 've hit me .
you would n't --
stop talking like that !
all parts intact .
he wants 75 back .

the van is blocking it now .

why are we stopping ?
yeah , i was waiting for that suggestion .
sooner or later you 'll learn to trust me .
what 's your point ?
you 're the man with the gun .
naturally .
naturally .
maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us .
that 's not good enough .
both hands on your lap .
some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me .
took preparation .
exactly who was this oberfeld ?

dyle 's dead .

alexander .

someone tried to kill me .
you ok ?
fine . are you ?
it 's flattened the whole school . guess what ?
what ?
mark invited me to the party .
what party ?
tonight . have n't you heard ?
you ca n't tell your parents .

especially not your dad .
i wo n't .
you 're thinking of sleeping with mark tonight ?
you have to go .
stag ?
come on .
i ca n't right now .
hi jody . what can i do for you ?
where do you keep the old town papers ?
what year are you looking for ?
twenty eight years ago .
this place is empty .
everyone 's getting ready for the party .
you heard about that ?
kids were whispering about it all day .
do n't you think it 's sick ?
in fact , i thought about going .
unfortunately i qualify . think i 'm too old ?
no .
cut it out .
why ?
i was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago .
i got to get home .
are you o.k . ?
i 'm fine .
i heard you got attacked .
i did .
did you hear about the bash ?
yeah . i think it 's really sick .
why ?
that 's not really the occasion for a party .
please go with me .
did sharon say no ?
you know i want to go with you .
i 'm grounded .
there 's a killer on the loose .
i 'm so sick of it .
i 'm not using him as an excuse .
you always hide behind him .
we 'll go together .
they 're not picking me up until six .
i 'll think about it .
what 's wrong ? am i doing something wrong ?
just making me feel like a piece of meat .
i 'm making you feel like meat ?
that 's not why we broke up .
you flaunt some slut in my face .
then go to the party .
jody . wait .
what ?
i want to go to this party .
my dad 's down there !
go to the police station !
thanks for coming back for me .
oh god it 's him !
what are you doing ?
hi mom .
hi princess .
mom ?
yes ?
i need to ask you something .
you can ask me anything .
lisa sherman ?
yeah . who is she ?
where did you hear that name .
i he thinks she 's the killer .
what ?
that 's what he said .
did he say anything else about her ?
really angry and super uptight .
maybe something else was on his mind .
like twenty-eight years ago . when dad was eighteen .
where are you going ?
who is she ?
i think that concerns me .
wait .
what ?
attacked how ?
at least that 's what she claimed .
you did n't believe her ?
but the boys were never formally charged .
you think kids are sexually bottled up today ... .
and the police did nothing ?
everyone just kind of looked the other way .
how could you ?
against the whole town .
the word is mob .
who ?
do any of them still live around here ?
two men left town right after it happened .
mr. sisler was one of them .
the principal ?
yes .
we both have ...
yes ?
yeah .

his mother 's side .
you ok ?
just thinking about something .

hi mark , cindy , ben .
i 'm lucky to get a zucchini stick .
then i remembered seeing you with one .
you can have both if you want .
you 're so beautiful .

now do n't be nervous .
let 's grab them quick before someone else does .
ok .
hide your laptop here .
no .
you ca n't bring it .
hey ! that was a 3k machine .
i said no .
maybe it wo n't stay in .
let me just ask you a serious question first .
what ?
are n't you worried you could die a virgin ?
if sheep do n't count .
that was n't me ...
rod !
you 're being unfair .
unfair ? !
stacy ?
okay , okay .
at least somebody likes this shit .

it came as a complete surprise to me .
a complete surprise ?
yes .

not that mulwray ?
well , you 're going to get it .

my husband 's at the office .
that 's not his apartment .
i 'll drop the lawsuit .
what ?
sugar ? lemon ?
mrs. mulwray ?
yes , mr. gittes ?
i should talk this over with your husband .
unless that 's a problem .
what do you mean ?
may i speak frankly , mrs. mulwray ?
she 's disappeared . maybe they disappeared together somewhere .
suppose they did . how does it concern you ?
nothing personal , mrs. mulwray , i just --
is this a business or an obsession with you ?
no . i went riding rather early .
looks like you went quite a distance .
otherwise he 'll be home by 6:30 .
i 'll stop by .

... just a minute ...
you left your keys in the ignition .
i 'll send you a check .
i got your check in the mall .

then you ask me to lie to the police .
it was n't much of a lie .

i 'm going with you .
you were saying ?
she was pretty young , hunhh ?
twenty-two ; same as us .

my aunt freaked out . it was a mess .
his dick was in his mouth ?
balls resting on his lips .
he made it , hunhh ?
i could never reach .
reach what ?
you know .
what , your dick ?
i guess everyone tries it , sooner of later .

you knocked the fucking casket over , for chrissakes !
it was an accident !
does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose ?
so the casket fell over ! big deal !
her fucking body fell out !
let me borrow your car .
i do n't want to talk to you .
fine . just lend me your car .
why should i loan you my car ?
i want to rent a movie .
what 's that for ?
let me borrow your car .
may i be blunt with you ?
so your argument is that title dictates behavior ?
please , get the hell out of here .
get to work .
what 'd you rent ? best of both worlds ?
and this is what you rented ?
i like to expand my horizons .
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor .
no way !
five hundred dollars .
i did n't think they even enforced this .
living proof .
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids .
i do n't ; you did .
really ?
little girl . maybe five years old ?
then how come you got the fine ?
because i 'm here .
you 're lying .
because i 'm happy .
you 're happy ?
i 'm happy .
you 're happy to get a fine ?
i 'm happy because caitlin came to see me .
now i know you 're lying .
i 'm not . she just left .
what did she say ?
she went home to tell her mother .
you 're kidding .
i 'm not .
is there anything i can do for you ?
watch the store while i go home and change .
what happened to title dictates behavior ?
this is my way of spitting water at life .
hey , what about veronica ?
in the meantime , nobody mentions the v word .
chicks with dicks .
who eats cock ?
there 's no lights back there .
make a little bathroom bam-bam .
it 's so ... kindergarten : poo-poo ; wee-wee .
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium ?
you just fucked a total stranger ?
she said she did all the work .
around three or something .
what time did we go to the funeral ?
what the hell is your problem ?
this life .
this life ?
why do i have this life ?
you know what the real problem here is ?
you should shit or get off the pot .
fuck you .
as if it 's that easy .
so what 's stopping you ?
leave me alone .
oh , like your life 's any better ?
it 's the same thing with veronica .
you 're twenty-two !
am i right or what ?
things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin .
make them change .
who 're you kidding ? you can so .
how 's your eye ?
but the fds stings . how 's your neck ?
i thought i was doing you a favor .
you still did n't have to choke me .
i 'm surprised i did n't kill you .
why do you say that ?
randal ... forget it .
what did i do that was so wrong ?
how do you figure ?
what time did you get to work today ?
like ten after .
then all you do is come over here .
to talk to you .
which means the video store is ostensibly closed .
i 'm not even supposed to be here today !
the floor looks clean .
you need a ride ?
do you work tomorrow ?
same time . what about you ?
i 'll call you . let you know .
helluva day .
to say the least .
get the fuck outta here already .
are you open ?
yes .
just the paper .
i 'd say about sixty , seventy-tops .
he 's got those love handles .
do i know you ?
you remember alyssa jones ? she hung out with ...
caitlin bree . yeah ?
i 'm her sister .
you 're alyssa 's sister ? heather ?
you know him ?
everybody in school knew-even in my class .
that milk only weighs about seven pounds .
i did n't strain . i sighed .
i do n't think so .
your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized .
they are not .
you 're out of shape .
there 's no fat on this body .
i am not .
how much can you bench ?
oh for god 's sake !
did you say caitlin bree ?
yeah ?
you played hockey ?
how do you know that ?
hey , you still going out with her ?
no , she 's getting married .
what ?
while i was dating her ?
that girl was like a rabbit .
when ? when did all this shit happen ?
hey !
are there any balls down there ? !
go open the video store .
done poisoning the youth for the day ?
e-z wider , one-and-a-halfs .
one seventy-nine .
do n't you close soon ?
a half hour .
we should hang out . you get high ?
i should start .
with you ? i do n't think so .
you ca n't roll a joint in here !
a dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what 's that shit ?
it 's not my store .
and these are n't my drugs-i just sell them .
the difference is you exploit a weakness .
all right . how much is pepsi here ?
he died in the bathroom .
yo , i heard he was jerkin ' off .
i do n't know . i was n't watching .
is this what you want ? hunhh ?
that used to be my girlfriend .
you used to go out with her ?
we were going to start again , i think .
do n't you already have a girlfriend ?
she came here today carrying a plate of food .
maybe .
damn . she sure goes out of her way .
meaning ?
i 'm sure he was n't sleeping .
you calling me a liar ?
no ; he was probably just resting his eyes .
actually , that 's his night job .
be careful .
no , he got hit by a bus .
oh ... can i help you ?
go ahead . it 's back through the cooler .
say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there ?
the white kind .
i mean is it rough or cottony ?
actually , it is kind of rough .
i see you sell the soft stuff .
yeah , but ...
yeah , okay . go ahead .
jesus ... go ahead .
can i trouble you for one of those magazines ?

that 's it ?
so why are they after you ?
it must 've been in my newsletter .
who would n't be ?
you okay ?
you want something to drink ?
if my universe had a hub ...
equitation .
i 've been reading up on it .
pissed someone off .

uh huh .
has this happened to you before ?
never , but i 've been practicing .
who are you , jerry ?
to my satisfaction .

and i do n't know how that 's possible .
so what 's the question ?
is this your dad ?
that was him .
is he dead ?
please put it down .
how 'd he die ?
he 's why you punish yourself .
not this again .
not since your dad died .
did you see the van back there ?
what van ?
you 'd think i was making it up .
where 'd you get your subscribers ?
you have n't been bothering them , have you ?
i 'm passing it to you , too .
i have n't been able to reach him yet .
like a mouse . i should have realized .
realized what ?
cold war 's over , jerry .
ernest harriman . you heard of him ?
but not one of them said he was murdered .
murdered ?
< u > in newport < /u > .
harriman drowned , but it was n't in newport .
right here . in the 7th street subway station .
they 're big details , jerry .
last week , this whole place was underwater .
a water main broke .
ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated !
okay , i will .
you will ?
i love you .
everything you do is magic .
those are song lyrics , jerry .
and i know how i feel .
i like you , jerry . a lot .
i do n't think i am , but ...
if i was normal . maybe ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
can you ?
you look great .
what is it ?
we 're going to queens ?
now what ?
i 'm the one who left it here .
where are we going , jerry ?
connecticut .
lee < u > harvey < /u > oswald .
he only had two names .
my father 's house .

he gave it to me .
i do n't understand .
where were you the day he died ?
is that why ?
did you kill my father ? !
yeah . i know what it 's like .
that 's the first time i saw you .
love at first sight ?
i could n't go back .
back where ?
when i arrived , your dad was dying .
he did n't believe the official story .
how 'd you get the picture ?
i believe you .
back in the truck .
they 'll trace it .
i 'm sorry .
blue moon ... blue moon ...
blue moon ...
without a song in my heart .
blue moon ...
liza ?

i 'll pull you up to the fourth floor .
geronimo is down .
you can fly away from here .
do n't die on me , jerry . okay ?
they changed franklin 's portrait .
i love you , too .
do i know you ?
i 'm a very patient man .
that 's great . good for you .
who else knows what you know ?
< u > liza < /u > !
it 's a moment without hope .
liza sutton is dead .
thank you .
you 're welcome . where 's my partner ?
are you here with honorable intentions ?
what about your intentions ? are they honorable ?
does that seem honorable ?
you made your decision yet ?
i 'm leaning toward no .
i want to make sure she 's okay .
she --
i want to see her .
i do n't know ...
then screw you . i 'll rot .
but she ca n't see you .
can i ask you something ?
a dog bit it .
excuse me ?
the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today .
and you feel bad for it ?
why do you insist on making me repeat myself ?
and you have no idea where he lives ?
you 've asked me that one three times .
that seems oddly possessive behavior to me .
i 'm sorry . what was the question again ?
< u > why you < /u > ?
i think he has a crush on me .
excuse me ?
truth . what is it they say about truth ?
the truth shall make you free .
i hope you wo n't hold that against me .
i did n't know the c.i.a . had psychiatrists .
how 's jerry feeling this morning ?
fine . what the hell is going on ?
ultra program . are you familiar with it ?
that was our goal .
that kind of thing .
we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation .
terminal ?
you talk about it like it was a religion .
jerry told me he bit your nose .
and what did i say ?
a dog .
extrapolate from there .
you did them to jerry ?
i 'm still listening .
jerry is dangerous . jerry has killed --
why are you telling me all this ?
where 'd you get it ?
you do recognize it then ?
kept it in his wallet . he was murdered --
in jerry 's safety deposit box .
it 's okay . i 'm game .

hmm , how about tomorrow night ?
working .
liza , settle a bet for us .
federal bureau of investigation .
i need to speak with an agent lowry .
yes .

this does n't make sense .
field work is not our oeuvre .
why is that ?
terminated . < u > understood < /u > ?
this guy fletcher 's something else .
tell me about it .

fletcher . they knew each other somehow .
which way did he go ?
agent lowry .
was n't my idea .
jonas ?
can i talk to you a second ?
do you believe me ?
yeah , i do .
i want to believe you , too .
what gave me away ?
and jonas ?
jerry 's the bait for jonas .
where do you think jerry is ?
honest . what are you going to do ?
because he 'd find me .
either one could be bad .
what do you suggest ?
that you come with me .
what ?
repeat , control to arroway , come back .
we 've lost contact .
pull the plug . get her out of there .
there 's no plug to pull .
as your father ?
yes , sir .
he died ... ... in 1972 .
is it possible ... ?
what was their intent ?
dr. arroway --
michael kitz , national security advisor .
hope there 's a cartoon .
what in the hell ... ?
kent .
how 's the new office ?
i 'm willing to take that risk .
i disagree .
pepsi ? tequila ?
peter sends his regards .
now exactly . it 's ... complicated .
no doubt .
so we 've been trying variations of pi ...
but the price has just gotten too high .
goddamnit , they are out there , david --
throw a gray scale on it ; standard interpolation .
with me .
this could be a chance to win him over .
what is it ? what 's happened ?
we 've cracked it . lunacharsky found it .
you mean --
david --
ellie .
do you have a minute -- ?
actually i 'm running late --
i do n't understand .
what ?
you ...
you are n't staying ?
this ... seemed best .
right . well .
and it is n't fair ...
what would you have me say , david ?
i guess i just wanted to thank you .
what does it say ?
what 's the status of the decryption effort ?
dr. lunacharsky ... ?
what ?
and ?
no primer .
how can that be ?
j39 z186 ... ?
got a bogey , boss ?
hydrogen times pi ... got it . strong sucker .
dr. cullers ?
you must be eleanor .
ellie . pulsar ?
here , right around centaurus a .
this is how you see the sky ?
try not to take it too personally .
ca n't we get rid of them ?
i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot .
and a hundred mile airspace .
is that your official response ?
please answer the question , doctor .
is it possible . yes . but --
small moves , captain , small moves .
talk to him .
but what do i say ?
could we hear to china ?
come on now , under the covers .
could we hear god ?
maybe his echo ... okay , no more stalling .
pensacola .
you 're not real . none of this is .
that 's my scientist .
you might ask that about anything .
so who -- what -- are you ?
can you show me ?
small moves , captain , small moves .
why did you contact us ?
we 've been listening for millions of years .
i mean ... there are others ?
so who ... ?
some never make it this far .
so we passed some kind of test ?
life is simply too precious not to .
am i one ... or many ?
all made of the same primordial atoms .
so . what happens now ?
now ... you go home .
it 's time to go home now .
no . please .
why am i here , mr. hadden ?
i want to make a deal .
perhaps i could help deal you back in .
i 've found it .
a page-break signal . a period .
some kind of circuitry ... ?
i need someone on the inside .
a sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes .
what 's that ?
david , too .
what are you talking about ? it 's over .
because they 're running out of time .
hokkaido island .
the systems integration site .
why do n't you come back with me ?
i 'd say this is slightly different .
ellie . arroway .
peter valerian .
sounds like a russian general .
it 's brilliant .
'any sufficiently advanced technology ... '
any luck on the grant money ?
the v.l.a . ?
actually --
we could be together again --
-- i 'm moving to washington .
greenbank ?
to work for drumlin .
it 's what i want .
let 's get married .
ellie --
i 'm serious about this , peter --
you sonofabitch .
ellie .
it 's good to see you , ellie .
someone tell me this is really happening .
it 's really happening .
that you , valerian ?
like it or not .
ellie -- are you okay ?
i 'm -- i 'm fine .
did you notice anything at all that --
what malfunction ? what day is this ?
what day ?
has everyone gone completely insane ?
champagne please .
it must have taken tremendous faith .
spoken like a true believer .
'my father 's house has many mansions . '
i flinched .
can you try ?
unless i have proof how can i be sure ?
do you love your parents ?
my father died when i was nine .
did you love him ?
yes . very much .
is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this ?
they 're saying the machine is alive .
maybe you 're creating a monster .
i do n't think so .
why ?
which it 's pretty certain you would n't .
i read your book .
catchy .
you did n't answer my question .
but that 's just the enemy 's perspective .
do you really believe your life is meaningless ?
do n't you see the contradiction here -- ?
it 's getting late ...
ellie --
but what if we do n't like the answer ?
i said some things ...
so . the final countdown .
the final countdown .
what ... ?
i 'm sorry .
ellie , what is it ?
i 'm sorry -- i ca n't --
what ?
i ca n't do this --
in fifty years ? never ?
please --
i 'm in love with you , ellie .
and then what ? then you 'll be safe ?
hi .
hi .
i 'm assuming you read my deposition .
it was quite a page turner .
i 'm not sure it 's come to that .
they do n't believe me .
i do .
as it will everyone else 's .
i do n't have any proof , palmer .
but --
in other words , god works in mysterious ways ...
it was still searching for meaning ...
maybe its something we have to make for ourselves .
meaning ...
call it a reasonable precaution .
oh my god ...
but --
recommendations ?
git your shovel and git to work .
we made a deal -- -

and her husband ? what was he ?
where 's the car ?
outside in the visitors , car park .
what ! ? they brought the car here ?
have you seen it ?
he did n't believe you 'd gotten out alive .

silly ? silly am i ?
michael , take it easy .
silly , silly , silly .

i guess we need to talk .
i guess so .
i sure know what that feels like .
and all the plans we have .
you stopped taking your medications .
i did n't mean to do that .
well then why 'd it happen ?
what are we going to do ?
what do you want to do ?
i love you so much .

i guess i should go now .

the superintendent said he 'd fund it .
maybe tomorrow ?
you 're going to be late .
you do n't have a fever .
but what about that math project ?

i 'm just ... i 'm so tired lately .

what are you doing ?
can you loan me a 20 ?

i 'm going to the store .
yeah , i guess it 's all right .
are you all right ?
that 's a big question .
i hope it was n't something i did .
is that why you 're here ?
i think we need to talk about some things .
yes , i suppose so .
no .
especially this last year .
especially now .
we ca n't just keep going through the motions .
exactly . it 's time to make decisions .
letty ?
no , you 've done a perfect job .
i hope you do n't mind .
no , no .
so will you ?
is it too much pressure ?
no ...
you what ?
and i have really loved you .
but we 're going to work through our problems .
i 've met someone else .
who ?
it does n't matter who .
have you been seeing another teacher ?
no .
here 's the ring .
none . i completely understand what was going on .
oh .
are you back at school ?
getting back .
i heard about your friend .
what ?
i heard your friend was back in the hospital .
i think i 've heard this speech before .
the superintendent was just getting ready to leave .
i 've worked really hard to get better .
what does that mean ?
i need someone to work on budget projections .
all tapped out .
how 's it look ?
shhh . they 're coming to the cubic zirconium .
i like those sapphire earrings myself .
you 'll love my grandma rosa .
agent hadley .
do you know who this is ?
okay . okay . i believe you .
you killed her !
your fingerprints were found all over the place .
she was alive when we left her with you .
that 's why you 're here .
a pass .
a witness can put me at the crime scene .
wo n't have enough to prosecute you .
they do n't have a murder weapon ?
you did n't have to kill sophie .
yes i did . lose ends are messy .
you 're just a two-bit crook .
you did n't have to kill sophie .
zero . that 's all i know .
you 'll find them . you 're the fbi .

li mu bai is coming to stay the night .
she 's crazy . you should have killed her .
i did n't have the heart .
who are you ?
i do n't care about your sword .
why were you spying on the yus ?
this jade fox is a woman ?
yes .
you 've brought me the sword ?
where 's your master ?
do you think you are a real master ?
all of it is simply a state of mind .
stop talking like a monk ! just fight !
then tell me where jade fox is .
on guard !
go ahead .
and if i use them to kill you ?
why is the green destiny in your possession ?
what 's it to you ?
i 'm just playing around .
tell me , who is your master ?
i 'll never live as a thief !
you 're already a thief .
how can i leave ? where would i go ?
even your father .
exciting , is n't it ?
i owe you nothing .
you could n't even decipher the symbols !
hello . what is your name ?
do n't bother .
you do n't seem to understand .
are you related to li mu bai ?
please sit .
do you want to change into them ?
put them down .
i heard you met shu lien today .
do you know her ?
i 'll socialize with whomever i please .
i 'm tired now .
god knows what the future will bring .
enough ! i 'm tired .
this spells trouble .
you 're just not used to handling it .
the scabbard is so beautiful .
it 's 400 years old .
exquisite ! you said it belongs to ...
why would he give his sword to sir te ?
you 're too young to understand .
certain moves , however , call for a sword .
without rules , we would n't survive for long .
they tell you all about that in those books ?
you 're not married , are you ?
what do you think ?
you could n't roam around freely if you were .
i 've missed you .
how so ?
you 're doing calligraphy ?
calligraphy is so similar to fencing .
please .
you must be overwhelmed by the preparations .
let me tell you a story .
about you and li mu bai ?
no , really ?
you say she killed a policeman ?
here you must be in proper attire .
i 'm not staying .
you , sister ...
they forced me to marry !
then you can decide about lo .
you know about lo ?
we 'll find a solution .
where is he now ?
he sent him to wudan mountain .
i 'm leaving !
you 're no sister of mine !
that 's li mu bai 's sword .
come and get it if you can .
without the green destiny , you are nothing .
you ca n't let li mu bai die !
she 'll help you . hurry !
you do n't deserve the green destiny .
not another lecture ! on guard !
let 's end this here .
what do you want ?
what i 've always wanted , to teach you .
give it back !
kneel !
never !
lo ?
let 's stop a moment .
give it back !
it 's better this way .
you coward !
all this trouble for a comb ?
a barbarian like you would n't understand .
by the way , i 'm a real manchurian .
i though you were a han .
give me back my comb .
i do n't take orders from anyone .
they 're still out there , circling closer .
let them look .
do n't send me back !
return it to me when we are together again .
go .
jen ...
do you remember the legend of the young man ?
`` a faithful heart makes wishes come true . ''
mu bai ... it 's been too long .
it has . how 's business ?
good . and how are you ?
he said you were practicing deep meditation .
yes .
i left the training early .
you 're a wudan fighter . training is everything .
you were enlightened ?
there was something ... pulling me back .
what was it ?
you 're giving it to sir te ?
he has always been our greatest protector .
it has always been with you .
it 's time for me to leave it behind .
it 'll be just like old times .
i must pray for his forgiveness .
i can wait for you in peking .
but something is going on at the yu household .
jade fox ? impossible .
no .
were you involved ?
have you questioned him yet ?
no , not yet ...
but your men are watching over yu 's compund ?
i do n't care about the sword .
then , why did you come ?
you gave it to sir te .
i saw her last night .
i knew she would intrigue you .
she needs direction ... and training .
you 'll kill fox , and she 'll marry .
she should come to wudan and become a disciple .
but wudan does not accept women .
do n't you want to see her again .
go home and check in .
what about you ?
i 'll look around and catch up later .
what happened ?
how did you get here ?
there is no antidote .
give me some hope ...
shu lien ...
save your strength .
i 've only one breath left .
do not waste it ... for me .
a murderer ?
it 's jade fox !
we 're just street performers . we were rehearsing .
they 're gone .
i can not accept it .
please accept our thanks .
i do n't know ...
you 're both wasting precious time .
but the sword could be in his compound .
it might get sir te in trouble .
just muscle .
and you 're gon na tell me who .
what in the hell ... do you call that ?
talent . hi .
care for a hot dog ?

no onions though , okay ?
no onions ?

funboy had to leave this mortal coil .
hey , man -- you 're hit .
it 's only a flesh wound .

they could n't do anything for me .
how 'bout the morgue ?
you sorta looked like you might need my help .
and i do n't need your help .
you 're welcome .
i do n't want you here .

i can pick out a tune now and again .
it used to be her favorite .

we 've got company .
i 've got him if you want him .
no shooting .
an unexpected pleasure .
tin- tin got himself whacked .
who got himself what ?
and it was n't a standard hit .
sounds like our `` crow '' is out-maneuvering you .
`` our '' crow ... ?
nice speech . what 's it supposed to mean ?
i 'm kathryn .

i do n't think so .

racist piece of shit .
god knows what he 's up to .
i 'll kick his ass in .
that 's when my parents get back and --
cecile 's attending oakwood in the fall .
i have a mission for you .
someone chaste ... pure ... innocent .
i do n't find this very funny ,
we 'll get together and plan your curriculum .
introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery .
sounds intriguing .
why not ?
jesus christ , is she for real ?
a paradigm of chastity and virtue .
it will be my greatest victory .
even this is out of your league .
care to make a wager on that ?
i 'll think about it ...
could you be more queer ?
be more specific .
you can put it anywhere .
even there ?
fuck her yet ?
i 'm working on it .
loser .
blow me .
call me later .
you would not believe what --
what 's wrong with you ?
any luck corrupting her daughter ?
no .
what 's your plan of attack ?
boo hoo .
i 'm at your service .
thank you . mmmm , that feels good .
it makes me so horny .
moving along quite well .

any day now .

you do realize that .
you amaze me .
yippy .

i 'm going to sound like a hallmark card .
ooo , i hear the birds chirping .
some other time .
excuse me ?
i 'm not in the mood .
and that 's why you 're leaving ?
it clearly is why .
i want to fuck .
oh my god . you 're completely p-whipped .
no , i 'm not .
p-whipped , p-whipped .
i 've always loved you .
not anymore you do n't . it 's obvious .
why so nervous ?
i 've never done this before .
how have you dumped girls in the past ?
screening calls . any suggestions ?
a little melodramatic , do n't you think .
you wanted an answer to your question .
i doubt she 'll ever trust a man again .
well done .
it 's over you .
get off me !
will you calm down ?
i 'm very sorry about that . i apologize .
i accept . now get out .
get out ? we had an arrangement .
and if i do n't ?
one . two ... three .
i think you have your answer .
you 're too kind .
call me an anachronism , but it works .
i hope i did n't keep you from something .
not at all . what 's wrong ?
it 's cecile .
we 've developed a friendship and ...
it is n't drugs is it ?
ronald ? that 's crazy .
she 's so young and he 's so -
i ca n't thank you enough .
you will be discreet about this ?

i come from great darkness and deep peace
but where is that ?
i can not tell you .
will you be friend for always ?
for as long as you 'll let me .
i shall want you for always .
only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
not even daddy ... or mommy ?
you 'll always play with me ?
ca n't you get it , darling ?
i 'll just never learn arithmetic .
but you must !
the numbers simply do n't mean anything
look . one is like a tall princess .
a princess ?
yes , yes ! i see prince ,
that 's right !
this is more fun than just pretend .
there 's an oak leaf . add a maple .
but we do n't have any sea weed .
i 'll show you my children .

bad luck to see death in the snow .

hard to see things in the twilight .
why does n't it get up ?
it got hit .
but i only came to give back the ring .
take some cake , why do n't you ?
no , thank you .
do you know the story of rapunzel ?
the headless horseman --
he 'll let me stay .
i brought you a present . merry christmas .

but we have . she 's wanted for nothing .
she 's been friends with jen forever .
i 'm lucky jen 's not like that .
waiter ! she needs more water .

jennifer gave her a make-over .
i 'm just starving .
you look so different .

there was a sale .
i mean where on your body ?
a dog at victoria 's secret ?
how 's the rest of your health ?
pms . what symptoms are you experiencing ?
it 's been about three weeks ?
nearly four .
is that all ?
i get crazy dreams and i black out .
does she have pms ?
jennifer ?
no it 's mom .
`` 60 minutes '' was on same-sex couples .
george said carlton 's a nice guy .
translation : a total geek .
anything 's better than mark .
my shrink says he 's not so bad .
it 's those big brown bambi eyes .
being noticed all the time .
he has n't said one word to me .
you 're so lucky you never get pms .
i get a little bloated sometimes .
do you really need these ?
only to see .
or if there 's a full moon .
victoria 's secret .
it 's an inner thing .
i do n't know .
where are all the mediums ?
can you believe she fuckin ' bit me ?
and she got the medium .
i think she broke the skin .
george bit you ?
maybe they have to pee .
do guys still pay ?
where ?
look !
maybe just a little .
hey , did you get contacts ?
am i bad luck or what ?
there you go , blaming yourself for everything again .
and he was ripped limb from limb ?
i 'm sure they were exaggerating .
why would they exaggerate ?
so did you do it ?
did i kill him ? of course not !
no , did you fuck him ?
no . i do n't think so .
you either did or your did n't .
alone .
what ? why the hell did he do that ?
i grabbed him and kissed him !
and then ?
i blacked out .
at least your pms is over .
are those mark 's ?
rule one : always wear make-up .
i wonder if he 's married .
peter even likes me without makeup .
hmmm . sounds suspicious .
how do you know if a guy is decent ?
give him the tampon test .
my arms keep getting really hairy .
you have to stop being so self- critical frida .
okay . i guess so .
what did he say ?
i think he called you beautiful .
charming carlton .
it 's really distracting .
my arms are so hairy !
look how much more hair i have than you !
a little bleach 'll fix that .
see i told you he liked you .
should i call the cops or ... peter ?
so where 's this infamous arm now ?
i put it down the garbage disposal .
that was not in my head !
maybe the blood was from your period like before .
i have n't gotten it yet .
hello ?
where have you been ?
i 've been here . what day is it ?
tuesday . are you okay ?
shit , i guess i missed work .
frida , carlton 's dead .
oh no .
and he was missing an arm .
i should go to confession .
get rid of him !
okay , i got ta go .
holy shit , i do n't know .
did you get rid of mark ?
he must be still in there .
he 's been here all night ?
what happened to his tooth ?
oh no peter . peter is the police !
do n't call the police .
why not ? there 's been a murder .
i told george i was with you last night .
what ? why 'd you do that ?
there 's kind of this guy i 'm seeing .
why the fuck would you do that ?
i 'm glad he 's dead .
you expecting someone ?
no .
what the fuck are we going to do ?
i think i just got my period .
does that mean this whole thing is over ?
you surf the web .
you 're such a good friend .
peter keeps asking me out .
see i knew you never loved mark .
let 's find her and talk to her .
seems her husband shot her .
do you think we can believe all this ?
what choice do we have ?
so what do i do ?
fall in love .
i 'm cleaning my stove .
i thought you were killing yourself .
you were fine for over three weeks .
i think i love him .
and if he really loves me ?
i guess you 'll find out .
i 'd rather kill myself .
no . i wo n't let you do that .
i think george knows .
about mark ? carlton ?
about benito .
i thought you and george were getting married .
hello ?
frida ? you okay ?
he 's still alive .
maybe this whole thing is really over .
he 's in the shower .
i know .
so you 're grant 's secretary ?
i do development for tv movies .
you 're kidding , really ?
you hungry ?
i 'm not really hungry after all .
frida keeps eating .
well , whattdaya think ?
i 've got terrible pms .
they say sex is great for cramps .
what ?
i really got ta pee .
you should have gone at the restaurant .
i did n't have to pee then .
my apartment 's just such a mess .
oh come on . knock it off .
knock what off ?
you do n't have to pee .
uh huh . so pee .
so pee ? here ?

you look different . i mean you look good .
you never say that .
you look really ... is that a wonderbra ?
look what you did !
oh my god , i 'm sorry !
worried about what all your girlfriends might think ?
frida , you know you 're it for me .
where 'd you get the bike ?
let me in .
it 's a matter of life and death .
this really is n't a good time .
you always blame me .
come on , i 'm your biggest supporter .
mark .
wow .
the nielson 's ?
on your desk .
script coverage ?
on your desk .
coffee and ...
how about a `` man in jeopardy '' story ?
did you change your hair ?
these women are all victims .
did you read that script i was talking about ?
no .
no ?
you busted me .
are you following me ?
i do n't know why .
peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag .
i think he 's been following me .
you wan na get some coffee ?
i 'm trying to stay away from caffeine .
maybe some other time . they continue walking together .
so what book did you buy ?
oh , it 's nothing .
no really , i love knowing what people read .
it 's stupid .
my mom used to get pms too .
used to ? did it stop finally ?
no , she died when i was twelve .
i 'm sorry .
she was killed by wolves they think .
must be wild .
well this guy was n't wearing any underwear .
how about you ? briefs or boxers ?
briefs .
so why did you and ... mark break up ?
i really got ta get going .
maybe we could ... get a bite sometime ?
yeah . maybe .
goodnight .
what are those ?
they were melted down from a crucifix .
what are they for ?
what 's wrong ?
just ... well do n't you have your period ?
you following me again ?
no . i was doing my laundry .
was there anything in that washer ?
everything okay ?
uh ... . hi !
it 's important .
you had a date with carlton ?
maybe he kills men you date .
no , why ?
i was looking for you . you changing jobs ?
yeah sort of . where 's lloyd ?
frida ... i ... can i carry your box ?
no , i got it . it 's okay .
what happened ?
except mark of course .
i got a hunch he fled the country .
this is a lot worse than `` betty . ''
is that how you feel ?
no , i wanted to say it .
you did n't say it .
what 's with the squirt guns ?
you know , i 've never seen your cat .
your breasts feel larger .
they do ? oh no ...
peter laughs .
hello ?
i want to help . i 'm coming over .
ever .
i mean no , not really .
you at least owe me the truth .
frida i can deal with that .
go away . i might hurt you .
frida ! i love you .
peter i love you too but ...
how do you know ?
no matter what form you take .
men ca n't get pms . unfortunately .
i knew you would n't kill me .
other couples have worse problems .
worse than this ?
what about ... those guys ... i might have ...
no one believes in werewolves .
i 'm going to take a shower .
here 's a towel .
the shrink makes more notes .
i think i 'm a werewolf .
you had sex last night and you feel guilty .
cause i 'm a fucking werewolf ! !
it 's about gregory jameson . he 's dead .
yes ... i ... we had dinner .
did you go to his apartment ?
no , it was our first date .
a kiss ? did you have sex with him ?
we can get a warrant if you like .
you heard about carlton fraser ?
and the last to see gregory alive .
alone .
you got a dog ?
no , i have a cat .
he picks up packages from the airport .
she 's really coming out of her shell .
she 's just so ... pathetic .
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along ?
maybe he got lucky .
it 's for you . frida .
it 's so bad she becomes a werewolf .
what the fuck am i supposed to do ?
take some allergy medicine .
you ca n't believe this bullshit .
relax guys . it happens .
how the hell is that your business ?
you want her sheets ?
see he was cheating from the get go .
they try to get me drunk .
he was found a few blocks away .
something 's weird .
the sight of blood makes me sick .
from her ... you know .
i told you she was innocent .
hey , there was a lot of blood .
some animal must have done this .
he was hairier than madonna in penthouse .
madonna 's in penthouse ?
her pits , her bush .
what ?
maybe she hired someone to kill them .
sounds like you got a conflict of interest .
the park dude was missing an arm .
he means the last that we know of .
you think mafia hit ?
this case gets weirder by the minute .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm not a suspect here .
and that was 28 days ago today .

police . nobody move .
he tried to kill me !

you seem a little edgy . everything okay ?
maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends .
tall fellow . no hair . rather pale skin ...
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
he was leaving your office at the time ...
in there .
was that for real down there ?
good evening , sir .
why are you wearing that thing on your face ?
these places are full of them .
by the way , howís your mother ?

a fanciful idea , mister white .
a book of delusions . anything else ?
but i ...
i see . the verdict , yes ...
i did n't realise ...
no . i , ah ...
someoneís after me .
then we must call the police .
what sins have you committed ?

that obvious , huh ?
somebody hit you ?
can i get you a drink ?
you know what i mean ?
are you sorry she 's dead ?
have you ever heard of dick stensland ?
yes . but do you know ?
he does n't want any attention .
our motives are selfish , so we 're cooperating .
why was susan lefferts at the nite owl ?
i never heard of the nite owl till today .
did lefferts have a boyfriend ?
like i said we were friendly , not friends .
how 'd she meet patchett ?
tell me about patchett .
he 's waiting for you to mention mention .
you want some advice , miss bracken ?
maybe i 'm just fucking curious .
you say 'fuck ' a lot .
you fuck for money .
is that an integral part of your job ?
yeah .
do you enjoy it ?
when they deserve it .
did they deserve it today ?
i 'm not sure .
can your policeman 's mentality grasp those contradictions ?
he had you cut to look like veronica lake ?
i guess i got in the way .
so you saved her .
do you like being a cop , bud ?
be a detective if that 's what you want .
did you talk to exley ?
i want to know about exley .
we talked .
so tell me about it .
in the morning .
lad , may i have a word with you ?
they 're making him a detective .
captain , what do you want ?
call me dudley .
do you hate them , wendell ?
why the loyalty , wendell ?
he helped me out once . that 's all .
< u > fucking exley < /u > .
they 're yours . take them .
there 's no goddamn bill on me ?
four of the defendants recanted their testimony .
you 'll be working out of homicide .
will you work for me ?
of course ... but how ?
how what , wendell ?
give me one minute .
it 's big , lad .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
can i count on you ?
you know him ?
hey , partner . grab a cup .
you nailed him good .
want to grab a beer ?
i got something big going on tonight .
that new mystery girl you 've been seeing ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'd like to ask a couple of questions .
let my daughter rest in peace .
what was that boyfriend 's name ?
muns or lunts or something .
stens ? was it stens ?
maybe . i do n't know .
that 's him . that 's him .
what 's through here ?
was it ... a rat ?
where are we going ?
yeah , that 's stens .
one in six . where 's the girl ?
you expect anyone to believe that ?
how 's it going to look on your report ?
why ?
lynn .
said he had something big going down .
stensland was going there to sell the heroin .
somebody got wind of it , killed them all .
dudley 's guys .
they planted them .
it all keeps coming back to dudley .
dudley must work for patchett .
let 's just kill them .
we play by the rules .
you want to tear all that down .
run a good-cop-bad-cop .
you expecting problems ?
two of his fingers are broken .
i do n't think dudley workd for patchett .
at least not anymore .
ellis loew .
you wanted to meet here ?
and you showed up anyway ?
she 's fine .
are you pierce patchett ?
where were you last night ?
richard stensland .
i do n't know him . mr ...
how did you find me ?
this is where lynn bracken 's booze bills go .
of course ...
where 's the other guy ? buzz .
thanks , but no thanks .
against your code ?
no .
then you would n't feel obligated to report them ?
i sense you share this feeling .
she is -- was -- a big doubles fan .
you wan na go downtown and discuss this officially ?
what little studio ?
sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon .
her ... jesus fucking christ .
i doubt she knows anything , but --
i heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters .
should i ?
now spill .
but i heard he 's disappeared .
more .
what happened to the heroin , johnny ?
padding my report . you know how it goes .
what do you want to know ?
whose shoe ?
who was sitting at this table ?
i found them just inside the meat locker door .
< u > ear plugs < /u > .
it does n't exactly play like dumb panic .
what 's your assessment of this situation ?
i 'm not afraid to do what 's right .
that 's the way to get him .
clean ?
more or less .
anything ?
where are the police academy files ?
i do n't have time . i have --
you 're twenty-two , are n't you , ray ?
so you 're twenty-two , right ?
man , why do you keep asking me that ?
i never truck with no sissies !
that fucking larry . i almost believed him .
believed what ?
i heard you like to shoot dogs .
dogs got no reason to live .
you feel that way about people , too ?
man , what 're you saying ?
ray , we got the shotguns .
i do n't own no shotguns .
why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator ?
!
who 's taking the ticket for this , johnny ?
this is mr. hudgeons , wendell .
you do n't need to tie me down .
but you were business associates ?
we were friends for chrissakes !
all in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o .
and ?
and ?
you placed first out of twenty-three .
the youngest applicant by eight years .
patrol division ?
you 're wrong .
dudley , we 've been over this .
answer yes or no .
yes or no , edmund .
or my father .
but white is a valuable officer .
white 's a mindless thug .
yes , dudley . i am .
yes , i do , sir .
why ?
ed , i want confessions .
stay with the nite owl .
i --
a few loose ends do n't matter .
no ... where 'd the tip come from ?
the rest is history .
why ?
and now you 'll provide them .
< u > no < /u > .
why not , lad ? absolute justice ?
something like that .
do n't start now .
john vincennes . it 's three a.m. , lad .
you remember buzz meeks , dudley ?
what 's this all about , lad ?
i 've been working with ed exley on it .
and since when do you work with edmund ?
have you discussed this with anyone else , john ?
no .
you 're the key witness ?
that 's right .
what 's the chief throwing you ?
< u > throwing me < /u > ?
yeah , exley . what 's the payoff ?
i 'm just doing my duty .
l.a.p.d .
damnit ...
what ?
glasses .
i need to speak to you .
damnit ... < u > what < /u > ?
i want you to follow bud white .
even i 'm not that crazy .
permanently .
you 'd be doing me a big favor .
what happened last night ?
just leave me alone .
you make a mistake ?
what ?
so what 's the point ?
i just want to solve this thing .
the nite owl was solved , lieutenant .
but i want half the collar .
what 's that for ?
what the hell 's going on ?
whatever you desire ... it 's fleur-fr-lis again .
what 's fleur-de-lis ?
you want to talk to him ?
she is lana turner .
what are you going to do ?
i 'll meet you at the dining car .
apparently , sir , he 's decorated himself .
i get the idea . you got a description ?
all of them reloading twice .
anything bothering you about the case ?
what are you talking about ?
it 's not a good week for ex-cops .
bud white 's been here ?
is the veronica lake look-alike one of your whores ?
a vulgar term , but yes .
what 's her name ?
lynn bracken .
why 's she seeing bud white ?
no .
not good enough .
miss bracken , i 'm lieutenant exley .
you 're the policeman bud told me about .
really ? what did white say ?
i 'm curious about you .
you do n't have information to compete .
do n't underestimate me , miss bracken .
how was i ?
absolutely the best .
you sound like you mean it .
the silver screen 's loss is your gain .
is it a patchett payoff ?
she going to be a hooker all her life ?
that 's gone , but i settled for reality .
some reality .
why not ?
i 'm pretty tough , myself .
you , me and white , huh ?
i think he 's behind all of this .
where will you go ?
when ?
right now , before i back down .
on what evidence ?
none . call it a hunch .
do you have any proof ?
so far you 're not denying it .
dudley 's got photos of me and reynolds .
officer white ?
a sweet man .
under the house .
my daughter was a virgin !
her name got mentioned .
is she ?
it 's right around the corner .
you lost me , sid . who ?
tell me , am i fucking santa claus ?
jack ! it 's christmas !
you like it , jackie- boy ?
off the record and on the q.t .
sid , it 's vincennes .
but i 've got something going with ad vice .
something good ?
not a word .
their slogan 's 'whatever you desire . '

what ?
if i could just see some identification .
i am a member of the royal geographical society .
right . and what 's your name , sir ?
what nationality would that be ?
this girl was probably twelve years old .
it 's inexcusable .
her hands and feet were tied .
what did you do ?
he walks away to the nose of the plane .
i was talking about the girl .
and a better jack . we planned badly .
that whole spur is a real possibility
and where are the expedition maps ?
in my room .
what 's the matter with you ?
why do they care about our maps ?
i believe i 'm rather late .

he 's in love with ghosts .
who are his ghosts ?
i do n't know what that means .
ask him who he 's killed .
where did you find that ?
i liberated it .
i think that 's called looting .
well , then ask him his name !
buon ' giorno .
she can take you as far as florence .

she stumbles over the word .
candaules
candaules you 're laughing at me .

i can already see .
i 've found the lost fossils .

no sand . that 's your drugs speaking .

with his sergeant . a mr. hardy .

your voice changes .

who knows the bosphorus hug ?
i 'm not sewing anything else .

for my hair ?
hana and the patient are alone .
so i follow the wires ?
you get hardy .
why would anyone do this ?
this one . i hope we do n't die .

he 's going to topple over if he cuts .
you 'll fall over . give me the pliers .
no . but he hands them over .
before i cut . just in case .

will you come with me ?
of course . when ?
i mean home . india .
is that what you think i think ?
kip . life a raft .

meaning --
mac 's signature .

are you implying that i 'm taking you inside ?
we 're doing this together . we 're partners .
i 'll see you get back to london .
a lifelong problem , i 'm afraid .
nice try . everyone thinks i did .
true enough .
the rembrandt -- that was quite good .
someone was expecting that .
on what ? another job ?
must be a really big job .
why do n't we take oxygen ?
let 's do it again .
did i hear a car ?
our equipment has arrived .
i did n't mean to get personal .
a dozen times .
got it .
charged ?
that 's it . we 're ready .
i trust it 's your size .
you bought this for me ?
thank you .
i 'll just go into the village .
certainly the most beautiful crook i 've ever seen .
are n't we early ?
to us . to the mask .
you were afraid of heights ?
are n't we all .
he was n't .
so you had to be your own lifeline .
camera in the --
bookshelf . sensors --
popup , on floorboards . and --
we 're working .
it 's a party .
one , two , three ...
i 'm counting the steps to the entrance .
they have n't changed .
you ca n't be too careful .
ready ?
can you see the other pirs ?
they moved it .
be careful not to break the laser beams .
careful ... careful .
we did it .
okay , you 're a thief .
yes . yes .
stop ! you 're making ... mistake .
it 's your mistake .
the big job .
what ?
your share .
we 're living history here .
that 's where the money is .
hmmm ... 44 long .
you 've got everything planned .
idle hands , the devil 's workshop .
do you know ?
oh my god , i thought --
what about the rules ?
well ... what are we doing ?
transfer .
the eight billion . from them to us .
what 's that ?
peoples china bank .
total , eight billion and change .
the oscilloscope 's already programmed .
that 's where the mask comes in .
so how long till we do this ?
you ca n't be serious .
the handover from them to us .
there are n't any surprises .
there 's always a surprise .
and you 're the best , so --
how do i look ?
pulse detectors .
charged .
parachute .
and i assume you have the magic cd- rom ?
no way to take another day or two ?
you should n't have .
ca n't break tradition . it 's bad luck .
you have something in mind ?
that was a lifetime ago .
it was wrong to deceive you .
but would you -- would you --
it was just a negotiating ploy .
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention .
oh , i do n't care about the money .
four billion dollars .
seen one billion , seen them all .
that 's because you grew up rich .
not for me .
very easy to do .
the sign of our partnership .
jesus god , it 's going through .
relax , do n't jam it ...
move it , what are you waiting f ...
the door 's the only way out !
jesus .
come on .
no way .
hang on .
i can not get rid of you .
put this on !
what 's wrong .
but --
-- you 're a cop .
he looks familiar .
knew you had a big job going .
you gave them the eight billion .
we need to make the trade tomorrow .
gin , really .
which is --
in the van .
tina was a wonderful woman .
had to get a liquid plasma screen .
and a bypass hose for the ac .
a big one .
this is big enough .
right .
oh , it is .
you look like george washington .
we better do this tonight .
it 's too soon .
the early bird gets the damn worm .
so patience , thibeau , patience . trust me .
remind me why .
you two make quite a couple .
we 're supposed to .
you better not be taking on a new partner .
suspicious , after all these years ?
i thought this gentleman was a waiter .
you damn well thought wrong .
tonight your league night ?
how come those commos want it so bad ?
this is just show and tell .
i 'm waiting for the tell part .
she 's calling the shots now .
you 're impressed with her , are n't you ?
almost as good as she thinks she is .
the boy is in el , u , v .
what makes you think it 's happening now ?
you know where my loyalties lie .
i got to have trust .
value : one million each .
you 're giving them to me ?
call it an expression of trust .
i figured that out .
see you .
probably not .
we file 'em all here , alphabetically --
oh , hell . i 'm dyslexic .
where 've you been ?
what the fuck did you do with my stuff ?
but that 's not pg & e 's fault .
pg & e is a 28- billion dollar corporation .
tony marvin .
his dry cleaners . you want him ?
whoa . remind me .
you should n't judge , brenda .
what the hell is this doing here ?
what 's she doing here ?
fax these to this number , okay ?
all of 'em ?
whew . is your ex-husband helping out ?
which one ?
there 's more than one ?
you must 've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon .
hi . donna irving ?
yes ?
i 'm erin brockovich , from masry & vititoe ?
you 're a lawyer ?
that 's a kind of cancer --
yeah , i 'm real sorry to hear that .
well , they paid for the doctor 's visit .
they did ?
we never even saw a bill .
wow . why would they do that ?
cause of the chromium .
the what ?
five million dollars ?
i can put them in a good school .
any school you want .
and get someone to help around the house .
yup .
you know ?
okay -- let 's try and settle down here .
i 'm sorry , erin .
you never called me back . i left messages .
i 'm sorry about that . really . but --
just -- for the weekend .
but she leaves early on fridays .
sorry . my kid --
where 's anna ?
out to lunch with the girls .
yeah . i got it . no problem .
you 're a girl .
you 're a girl .
erin , you 've been gone for a week .

come on , i 'm trying to help here .
what are you doing here ?
it was from a dr. frankel .
the irvings .
what medical records ?
the one from your office ?
course i did .
okay . a 5 % raise , and --
this is the only thing you found ?
i would n't be surprised if there 's more .
at least they made an offer .
i do n't get why they 'd do that .
and you ca n't ?
they 'll be driving around the valley for hours .
forty god damn percent ?
hunh-uh . absolutely not .
that 's crazy -- why not ?
it 's not about working hard --
bullshit .
with all your legal expertise , you believe that ?
how many families we talking about here ?
four more . eleven people . so far .
a much bigger deal .
kinda like david and what's-his-name ?
you 're doing the right thing , mr. masry .
what now ?
is that what i think it is ?
you wan na talk about --
and that 's what caused the contamination ?
but guess what --
they skipped that step .
that was his job .
no shit .
this is some damn good work .
oh , they knew . they had to know .
i like this case .
really ? it makes me sick .
you did n't care about my case ?
hey . i like working with you .
jesus . they look like the secret service .
i told him we 'd be out there thursday .
someone 's following me .
what kind of truck ?
i do n't know . big . dark .
i was just asking . are you all right ?
that fat-ass bitch wo n't give it to me .
i do n't have time to deal with --
is that what you want ?
take it or leave it .
whoa . no shit .
it 's about 50 thousand per plaintiff .
so what are you thinking ?
holy shit . who do they represent , god ?
why good ?
she insulted me !
not in my world .
i thought you should rest .
kurt thought , if it was just lawyers --
they 're talking serious money --
and , what , i 'm not serious ?
how dare you take that away from me .
no one 's taking anything --
you embarrassed me , erin .
between 50 and 400 million , definitely ?
uh-huh .
still a lot of money .
so why would pg & e offer it ?
wait , what do you mean , ten years ?
so in legal terms , ten years is --
when ? where ?
tuesday at seven , at the hinkley firehouse .
you 're not gon na be there .
i do n't care what the doctor says --
i 'm saying you ca n't come .
why not ?
he thinks you 're a loose cannon .
fuck kurt .
erin --

erin ? what are you --
i do n't know what to say .

i am not talking to you , bitch .

so i went and asked .
it was ... . the emperor ... .
yes , my lord .
my lord .
it has entered an asteroid field .
soon , lord vader .
he will learn patience .
much anger in him , like in his father .
he can do it .
he 'll learn .
will he finish what he begins ?
do you hear ? on this all depends .
the boy is our last hope .
i ca n't ...
you must survive , luke .
i 'm cold ... so cold ...
ben ... ben ...
... luke , you must not go .
but han and leia will surely die .
even i can not see their fate .
i can help them !
you still have much to learn .
i feel the force .
still wasting your time with this clown , eh ?
growls a reserved greeting .
licks his lips .
barks a blue streak .
three patrol ships are heading our way .
howls .
well , it 's been awhile .
barks and growls at his boss .
barks at han .
barks his concern .
barks at his master .
we should have stayed and finished them off .
... the power ?
barks his consternation .
okay , chewie , it 's now or never .
... like we 're being watched .
i 'm looking for someone .
heh ? yes !
yeah ...
help you i can ... yes ... yes .
i 'm looking for a great warrior .
so ...
give me that !
i 'll need it in this slimy mudhole .
mine , mine .
i 'll stay and help you find your friend .
i 'm looking for a jedi master .
different altogether . yoda you seek , yoda .
you know the jedi master ?
... i told you , i 'm not hungry .
patience . it 's time to eat .
how far away is he ?
why wish you become a jedi ?
yes sir !
sergeant , is commander skywalker back yet ?
he probably came in through the south entrance .
maybe he slipped by without checking in .
we 'll have to go out on tauntauns .
what is thy bidding , my master ?
there is a grave disturbance in the force .
i have felt it .
our destruction ? who ?
obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
that would be a great asset .
that 's right .
i hate to lose you .
come on , chewie .
wait . i 'll send a patrol with you .
might i have a word with you ?
transport xj . get out of here . go !
sir , i was wondering ...
sit down , and shut up !
it sounds like it 's trying to get in .
goodbye , mistress leia . goodbye , captain ...
yes , your highness ?
han , we need you here .
we ?
yes .
not you ?
me ? i do n't know what you mean .
you 're so terrified of your own emotions ...
i 'd just as soon kiss a wookiee .
your big opportunity is flying out of here .
we are fighting for a cause much ...
i 'm afraid there 's not much left .
what was it ?
it must have had a self-destruct ... .
an imperial probe droid .
i do n't know what he 's talking about .
i take it back .
that star destroyer is slowing down .
i 'm against that .
we 've got to get out of this shower .
now you 're making sense .
looks pretty good .
what is it ?
why , princess , this is so sudden .
i 'm getting angry .
you do n't look angry .
how do i look ?
that was no earthquake .
easy , your worship . only trying to help .
sure . i guess i make it difficult sometimes .
yes , you do .
stop that .
what are you afraid of ?
i happen to like nice men .
you mean a man you can control .
i do not !
there 's something out there !
where ?
are you crazy !
looks like some kind of mynock .
i see it chewie , hang on .
i 'm sure i checked it .
no lightspeed ?
full power on the front shield .
got any ideas ?
that depends . where are we ?
let me check my logs .
you keep logs ? my , how organized .
lando calrissian .
it 's a ways from here , but reachable .
a mining colony .
lando and i go way back .
can you trust him ?
i do n't like this .
what are you staring at ?
who 's staring ?
you look silly .
you look great .
has threepio turned up yet ?
he found him in a junk pile ...
must have been an accident .
i was worried about you .
i 'm heading back to the base .
thanks to you .
probe ? what probe ?
about what ?
i hope you make your peace with jabba .
no hard feelings ?
are you kidding ?
i always said you were a gentleman .
repairs ...
what 's wrong with her ?
how 's your mining operation going ?
they arrived right before you did .
get out of here , lando !
he 's after someone named skywalker .
what about leia and the wookiee ?
but they must never again leave this city .
i hope you have n't forgotten our bargain .
perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly .
no .
you said the empire would n't interfere in --
sorry , am i interrupting anything ?
not really .
truly you belong here with us among the clouds .
lord vader has set a trap for him and ...
look , i stand to lose everything by this .
we have no use for your kind .
it turned out lousy .
we 've got to find luke .
what 'd you say ?
i 'm going to miss it .
luke !
what ?
that 's a command !
someone 's falling .
the deflector shields are gone .
we 've got nothing to worry about .
i 'm sorry .
they 'll make the search easier .
is there any chance of them surviving out there ?
have they analyzed the one that was killed ?
two transports at a time is awfully risky .
closer ? !
what ? ?
rather touchy , are n't they .
i never doubted you for a second ...
does it still hurt ?
where are you going ?
i 'm not sure , really ...
why does n't everyone just take off ?
what are you talking about ?
...
leia !
are you there ? how 's luke ?
this hyperdrive had better work .
i have followed my feelings .
i 'm not afraid .
i thought i was in good shape .
no longer of use are they to you .
okay . i 'll give it a try .
i ca n't . it 's too big .
i do n't believe it .
concentration . heh ? concentration .
i thought those seekers were set for stun !
anger is what you feel .
but i feel the force flowing !
price ? what do you mean ?
lord vader ... is the dark side stronger ?
never for attack .
but tell me why ...
four this time ! the force you feel .
into it you must go .
what 's in there ?
ben ? ben ?
free your mind and return he will .
not easy , not fast .
i see a city in the clouds .
concentrate and see them you will .
... they 're in pain ... they 're suffering .
will they die ?
remember your failure at the tree ! heh ?
and sacrifice han and leia ?
you have learned more than i anticipated .
you 'll find i 'm full of surprises .
obi-wan knew this to be true .
no !
come , the emperor will complete your training .
i 'll die first .
do not resist . it is our destiny !
anything on the millennium falcon ?
it wo n't get through the blockade .
did you call the zoo ?
general brody 's very pleased .
good god .
they 're ... pretending to dress .
and i mean you no harm .
do you have a name ?
and this is zira -- my wife .
nobody 's going to believe it .
believe what ?
to a lot of psychiatric small talk --
and we can watch ...
what , lewis ?
there was a sort of carpetbag in the ship .
with food ?
stevie , they changed into them .
what are they doing here ?
go easy , stevie .
they look pretty docile .
we shall want a full autopsy ...
with particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas .
he 's your own kind .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
may i say something personal ?
please
he hit the bottom of the curve .
it 'll start to take effect in 9 hours .
gangs fighting for the right to rule .
his reactor 's starting to overheat .
who 's that ?
i bet he 's fake .

i can not --
good day to you , sir .
you lack a knight 's humility .
move aside !
yield . i have the advantage .
your avoidance mocks me .
but your life and lands are far from here .
has n't merlin mended your wound ?
at last ...
... i was dreaming ...
of merlin ?
i have never dreamed of merlin before .
he can be no other .
who is merlin ?
you saved me from the arrow ...
but not from your destiny .
i want to thank you .
i do n't know how --
i ca n't lose him .
how can i --
how ? where ?
in the great book .
what book is that ?
what ? !
a king must marry , after all .
put your mind to it , then .
and a beloved friend who will betray you .
guenevere ...
they should have killed you .
excalibur ! is it true ?
it would be politic ...
at your service , sir .
now that guenevere is returned to me ...
yes .
that frightens me .
but you ! you betray yourself .
will you ride with me , merlin ?
i have heard noises and echoes through the stones ...
what is this place , merlin ?
but , i 'm here .
is it true that morgana --
father ...
i left it in the tent , sir .
i saw excalibur , and ... i took it .
you freed it , son ?
who is , then ?
it did n't hurt too much , did it ?
ye ...
at least a week .
lancelot , rest here .
do n't start a war on my wedding day !
sir gahalt , answer the queen .
who does it serve ?
you , my lord .
why am i served from the chalice ?
because you and the land are one .
and i can not live .
no .
there is one .
who ? !
you .
me ?
yes . i would swear my love to you .
the law forbids it .
there are things about love --
why did n't he kill us ?
a knight in the king 's service .
very well . climb up .
an apple . tomorrow . sir gawain ...
you left your brother 's wedding ?
is that mandrake , lord merlin ?

the deepest secrets , the forbidden formulas ...
they do .
you are truly magnificent !
show me !
you provoke me , merlin .
i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames .
a truce . we meet at the river .
merlin , what is this wagging of tongues ?
speak the words .
it is mine to know which , and when .
i swear it . by excalibur and the holy --
swear it again .
now you must pay me .
i ?
the oath . you did n't say --
to kill and be king , is that all ?
but it 'll take another , a greater king ...
c'mon i can read for christ sake .
well what 's wrong ?
well why are they tearing the building down ?
he 's in paris i believe .
what honey ?
there should be a psychiatrist present , anyway .
and what about the exorcist ? any ideas ?
how about lankaster merrin .
what 's he doing there ? teaching ?
how 's his health ?
besides , he 's had experience .
i did n't know that .
you 're convinced that it 's genuine .
you 'd want to do the exorcism yourself ?
i see , your excellency .
it's-
i 'm not putting her away !
i 'm sorry .
hello ?
hi

i mean ...
how 'd you know it was me ?
i 'm not really dressed for a party .
those yours too ?
i ca n't take this .
what about his first born ?
you always let this guy push you round --
that 's < u > enough < /u > .
i can not do it .
its just like the shuttles you flew in --
a flight < i > simulator < /i > .
five times .
i had it at four .
he 's made a few changes .
you should be the one up there .
the shields on the station should protect us .
i ai n't done arranging your flowers , egghead .
how long was i out ?
how are you feeling ?
i just keep going over and over the numbers .
yeah , you and debbie and perfect --
are you alright ?
what the -- !
we had a tough year .
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
it 's about to be a broken face .
ben --
we 're working as hard as we can --
ben ...
i think if we can rework the power settings ...
'course not . strictly business .
yeah , well , his eyes say different .
hmmm , it 's a toss-up .
put your tiny little mind at ease .
where ... where am i ?
victor 's medical facility ... we 're in quarantine .
reed ? ... sue ?
you had the best --
and vic 's gone mister hyde on us --
no more cracks about how i look .
i need you to step out front .
ben ?
what did you wish for , honey ?
i 'm worried about you .
about me ? how sweet .
ben , come in .
what do you want , vic ?
yet another mistake for `` mr . fantastic . ''
so when do we leave ?
who the hell came up with them ?
i 've got to meet with victor .
you look like an eighties rock band .
the suit will stretch . you should try it --
he did n't .
he 's always been a hothead --
i ca n't live like this .
it 's easy for you to be patient .
< u > where is reed < /u > ?
every system is still functioning , somehow --
and they 're changing into ...
harder than diamonds --
what do you mean `` complete '' ?
what ?
but ... this disease ... is progressive ... degenerative ...
close the shields .
he 's not responsive --
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .
better not be my nurse !
this is wrong in so many ways .
from outside the place looks a lot taller .
this place is deluxe . you got cable ?
back it down , johnny !
about flaming , that you --
just because i dress well and like to dance --
i ca n't put my finger on it --
johnny . supernova .
but all these people ...
you 're hot !
so are you !
i mean , you feel a little feverish .
me like-y .
stay right . left is trouble .
i though we went over this .
you 're on fire !
flame on , flame off --
stop it .
you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?
you 're really cramping my style here .
any hotter , you 're approaching supernova --
i 'm driving .
you two need a time-out .
johnny ? did you see ben ?
i 'm moving back to the real world .
you know mom did n't raise us to --
what are you doing --
they 're ready for you , sir .
the bank 's five times oversubscribed --
i could make money in my sleep .
then what is it ?
leonard , how 's the feed ?
how 's the ipo ?
you know , maybe you should get some rest --
you could have any woman in the world but --
i do n't need this to hit the press .
front page ?
funny how things turn out , is n't it ?
we need to abort .
just close the shields ...
ben 's still out there --
come on , ben , come on ...
a couple scrapes . why ?
ben did this .
you ruined the lives of four people --
i , uh , think i remember the number .
i 've been working on a formula for this .
feeling better ?
yes , thanks .
that 's good . that 's uh ... good .
which was ?
i < u > ca n't < /u > .
what ?
sue . your clothes . lose them .
that 's what we 're here to find out .
that 's what you projected on the bridge .
can you remember the exact emotions when --
anger . rage . frustration .
some memory or ...
i think it was a little more complicated than --
there were a lot of variables to consider --
what are you doing ?
and reverse the mutations --
< u > reed < /u > ... ?
of course . of course .
reed . how close are we to a cure ?
god , i was so nervous .
you < u > were < /u > ?
ten . waiting for you to come find me .
why did n't you say something ?
i can ... make it work .
i found a broken gasket , from space --
the company 's accomplished so much .
what are you doing ?
raising the shields .
what 's going on ?
victor , i 'm sorry i --
victor , your scar --
you said it was urgent .
please do n't make this personal --
'scuse me .
reed 's gon na fix me up --
i 'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical .
okay , don .
where do we stand ?
okay to proceed .
we 've got , to take them out !
we still have fifty-one minutes . leave them in .
the less time , the better .
what are the problems in stopping the heart ?
i told you to cut down on the sugar .
the proteus may already be destroyed ...
now how soon can we try sodium pentathol ?
i 'd hold that off awhile .
hello , grant . good to see you again .
benes ... what the devil happened ?
the other side got to him .
how bad off is he ?
brain injury .
before or after what he wanted to tell you ?
-- and why we need you .
ever hear of him ?
who 's the girl ?
you 'll join duval and the others --
wish i knew why .
right , sir .
in addition to the looks department ?
< combined miniature deterrent forces > .
i assume benes knows how to control it .
which is why they tried to kill him .
and take a little trip with them ...
you mean < i 'm > going along ?
as part of the crew .
they ca n't shrink < me > !
grant , our miniaturizer can shrink anything .
but i do n't want to be miniaturized -- !
it 's only for an hour --
just one , general ...
yes ?
ca n't remember ? ... what do you mean ?
yes , we 'd like to get moving .
yes , alan .
[ line of dialogue cut off ]
just because he 's often difficult --
difficult ? he 's impossible !
listen ... the heart .
i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
what 'll happen to him ?
i do n't see the sense of going on .
we must !
would n't it be quicker if we all helped ?
doctor ...
yes , cora .
not even under an electron-mrcroscope .
air bubbles ! ... doctor --
cora , is something wrong with the laser ?
he 's making a fine recovery .
we 're pushing oxygen today .
i am . being shrunk ...
that 'll teach you where to keep your hand .
a long time , with one man .
look at that ... they 're changing color ...
then how come it worked loose ?
should n't you answer that ?
maybe that 'll do it .
you must carry spare parts --
no , it requires such absolute precision --
a surgeon might ...
if we had the parts .
open it ! open it before they get here !
no need to get up --
thank you for saving my life .
that 's what they pay me for .
such as ?
keeping an eye on dr. duval ...
i knew it from the start .
under a cloud without cause , i take it .
every second counts now .
doctor , what 's wrong ?
i 've got to get out !
looks like the molecular structure of proteins .
but that is n't possible .
what can we do ?
yes ...
it 's against my better judgment ...
i 've done all i could with the laser .
dr. duvall i insist you test the laser .
-- and certain chemicals involving proteins --
you left something out .
what 's that ?
removal point ? what 're you talking about !
and there 's no limit to either .
an ocean of life ...
do n't tell me they 're refueling ...
is n't there another surgical procedure you can try ?
you said there was a quick way out !
what about dr. michaels ?
we need you for security purposes , mr. grant .
at an operation ?
miss peterson , his technical assistant .
a what ?
tell them to take us out .
if there 's any chance --
sounds like heavy artillery ...
there it is !
carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
the wireless , or benes ' life ?
it should be clear sailing through this area .
sabotage ? i do n't understand ...
you have no right to blame duval --
that line was tampered with ...
whatever happened was an accident .
two in a row ?
looks like somebody declared war .
what happens if we overstay ?
i do n't believe that .
i ca n't tell you .
where we going ?
may i ?
what 'd you do that for ?
i 'm married .
sort of .
atomic fuel ?
'prepare for miniaturization ' ...
any reserve air ?
what happened ?
dr. michaels ... he went berserk ...
come on -- it 's no use !
is n't that right , skipper ?
uh -- what ?
just < great > ? !
oh -- sure , sure ! never better !
what is it , skipper ?
what 's wrong , skipper ?
how 's it look ?
that 's it ...
it was probably caused by that electric shock .
was there any damage ?
but i 'm willing to try it .
then do n't drift down further .
doctor -- the channel 's getting awful narrow .
remain in the middle .

opening night , lillian .
who the hell cares ?
you understand me .
that 's always been my problem .
and you 've been extremely patient .
because i am patient , chain-smoking lillian .
i wanted to see what you saw .
i 'd forgotten that .
you smoked because i smoked .
that 's very lovely actually .
let 's be open with each other .
joanne bourne .
alma wetzel .
this is insupportable . how could you ?
she 's , you know , a woman .
i am really , deeply sorry .
it violates so many trusts .
she thought her apartment was too impersonal .
i 'm glad we 're having this talk .
great game . red sox are winning .
life is good .
people are dependable .
all the failures , all the fatalism .
washed away .
what did it say ?
a thousand things .
this could be it !
life is true .

i 'm at the door .

pop , will you let me in ?
where the hell are you ?
what do you want ?
it 's me . nicky .
nicky comes on sunday 's .
i 'm on my way to get a haircut .
five people in these little rooms .
we must have been heroic .
a grandmother . a dimwit uncle .
`why does n't he come live with us ? '
you know the answer to that .
we 'll go to mannion 's .
they 're only gon na lose .
you get older , you nhave other things .
but the son is suppose to stop crying .
i have to know what you think .
since when did that matter ?
let 's not start that again .
my back is killing me .
where 's your elastic brace ?
i lost it . i lose everything .
because everything is here .
and everything worth remembering is right here .
who we were and where we come from .
so what are you going to do about it ?
what do you want me to do ?
i know i recognize you from somewhere .
everybody else does . why not you ?
the gangster from rhode island .
oh yeah ?
some little kid stole the hubcaps .

and it looks like we 're going nowhere .
might be an accident on the west side highway .
how come you got the kid with you ?
matthew 's my grandson .
a grandmother . god bless you .
but we never had a famous mobster before .
it 's the kid 's lucky day .
if shooting people is charming .
now that 's a complicated subject .
that 's a simple subject .
what am i doing ?
you 're charming the boy .
hey , toyota . he asked me a question .
they think you 're the secretary of the treasury .
somebody 's flesh who was innocent once .
you 're a family man , frankie ?
it 's a complicated subject .
losing is easy .
it will humanize you as a person .
then say it .
life is good .
i do n't know .
and your grandmother knows why .
because god loves a winner .
to tmy wife and daughter .
washed away .
because life is good .
do n't worry . it 's a test .

it 's all over .
why do you care ?
they 're my team .

she is completely ncommitted .
you were n't concerned , she said .

there was a review .
i think i remember .
so does elliot .
not one of steven 's finer moments .
oh . you know him .
a little .
and he has finer moments now and then .
a funny little quality i find --
endearing .
engaging .
elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike .
a little drastic maybe ?
say it again .
what ?
you know what .
alla puttanesca .
how do you do that ?
glued to the shadows .
here i am , world .
i hear good things about the new play .
so do i . over and over .
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously .
in case you have n't noticed .
the fact is , i have to get going .
is it true ?
is what true ?
he wears a disguise .
no friends . no phone .
but you 're his friend .
do you think he can do it ?
i do n't know .
he 's a very sweet man .
where are you going now ?
home .
someone waiting for you ?
so i want to do him grave harm .
how can you care what i do with whom ?
do you want to talk about doing crazy things .
yes .
what ? come on , paisley .
our steven not only disguises himself .
yes .
he feels he has to defend himself if necessary .
i wanted to believe you would one day .
i have n't come to you .
steven , it 's so unfair .
they 'd come after me in packs .
write the truth gently .
stay . teach me to be compassionate .
-- i told you about english law .
i 'm proud of them .
are you sure ?
oww !
everyone takes his turn .
i am your wife .
please ! you 're being foolish !
god gave you ten thumbs .
jinnah has --
jinnah has -- what ?
is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that ?
that is what you get for distracting me .
enough .
i 'm sorry .
you 're a clergyman .
does that surprise you ?
that was lucky .
i thought you were a man of god .
what are you doing ?
then it will be prison .
i thought it meant father .
you mean gandhi ?
back in south africa ... long time ago .
what 'd he say ?
tell me -- do you think about hell ?
`` hell ! ''
i 'll take your luggage back , baas .
what can we do ?
and jinnah ?
you belong to a very important profession .
i 'm still searching for a `` response . ''
you 're an ambitious man .
it 's beautiful .
hm . is it ?
do you remember much of south africa ?
are you going to walk all the way ?
ba will have to teach you to spin too .
i would rather march .
do you find me stubborn ?
you mean a general strike ?
who is that young man ?
i 'm hardly that , mr. patel .
we need your help !
we are children of god like everyone else .
they 're sparing no one , i see .
have they touched the women ?
they 've arrested her and four others .
the fools ! sorry ...
it 's split the government .
will you have a glass of sherry ?
perhaps some tea ?
i dined at the prison .
of course it is not quite that simple .
can you understand that ?
assuming we are in agreement ?
and it still goes on .
who 's leading them ?
what the devil has happened to him anyway ?
have you read his magazine ?
it 's insane -- anything would have been better .
could we cut all news off ? i know --
you almost sound like you believe that .
you 've gone as far as you can go .
there are a few million miles to go yet .
how is that possible ?
i beat < i > myself < /i > .
who are you trying to convince ?
we have to go back !
how much extra ?
not yet , i 'm afraid .
no ? what 's keeping you ?
i guess i 'm a slow learner .
a man 's dead , detective .
this was an angry killing .
there 's no record of any living relative .
random car stops .
we 're already getting complaints about frivolous search .
the employees are all accounted for .
does this michael 's cater to misfits ?
do n't underestimate these imposters .
at least go with a fingertip sample or urine .
that 's the last .
something 's not right .
it 's a blind alley .
we hoover again .
we do n't have the manpower .
from outside , if you have to .
what are you waiting for ?
where do we start ?
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep .
what more do you want ?

we believe we have a suspect .
would you care to look -- in the telescope ?

what 's wrong with it ?
i do n't know exactly , jerome .
you are a disappointment , jerome .
what about this ?
it needs work .
you had to be a right-hander .
you really need that much ?
i see it as going home .
what 's in this for you , eugene ?
who died ?
the mission director .
now there 's nothing between you and ignition .
he was still warm when they confirmed .
this calls for a celebration . does n't it ?
the place is crawling with hoovers .
that 's not the point .
i got ta stop ! !
you 'll all be showering in it , right ?
up there they would n't be a problem .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
-- what car ? -- go to sleep .
it 's all right .
call german .
any particular reason ?
we ca n't stay here .
what are you talking about ?
what makes them think that ?
they found my eyelash .
where ?
in a corridor .
come on -- we 're taking off .
we should cut our losses .
they 'll recognize me .
how could you be so careless ?
you really had other offers ?
she 's my ear to the investigation .
is that all ?
i 've got enough on my mind without that .
if you say so . the stripe .
i think i 'm still drunk from last night .
how was your evening ?
where are we going ?
i 'm sorry . i 've got plans .
again ?
i have to act like nothing 's wrong .
where are you taking her ?
everybody goes there .
you may as well invite her here .
will you be okay ?
the conversation will just keep getting longer .
how are you , jerome ?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get here .
i have your samples ready .
why have you done this ?
in case you get back before i do .
where are you going ?
thank you .
we 'd like grandchildren .
antonio , the choir ...
vincent ... vincent ...
german , is that you ?
actually , he was a big college swimming star .
i hope he 's not just a body .
how do i square the accident ?
yeah .
i 'd have to bleach my hair .
you can wear lifts .
even with lifts i 'm never that tall .
why not ?
these new personality corrections i 've been reading about .
you worried about the cost ?
not that .
hugo ! i 've found him !
i 've found him too .
were you alone ?
i was at home .

no .
why do n't we say we were together ?
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean anything .
we were just looking .
have they found our friend ?
friend ?
it was a mercy-killing after all .
they found an eyelash .
where ?
in the south wing .
does it have a name ?
perhaps we ought to celebrate , irene .
you did n't know ?
yes ... < i > yes < /i > ...
you 're angry --
i envy you , jerome .
you 'll be next .
what exactly is wrong ?
of course i think about it every day .

just thinking out loud .
yeah , well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself .
we know what a great talker you are .
fuck you .
not anymore you do n't . doll .
this looks corny .
maybe it 's supposed to be funny .
so what did you think ?
i think you guys are all jealous .

and i do n't mean the water .
it never crossed your mind ?
it still hurt . a lot .

a big , fun , slightly irresponsible kid .
i 'm not a kid .
i 'm a free man .
that 's what you 're telling me ?

of course . i am married still .
yeah ? what 's your husband do ?
he is dead now , twenty years .
then you 're as single as i am .
very sad .
you 're sure of that ?
sins of the flesh ? everybody has those .
men who bugger each other .
a homo ?
you 're telling me mr. whale is a homo .
you did not know ?
well ... no , not really --
you and he are not doing things ?
no !
i 'm not going to hurt anyone .
it 's not what you think .
we are having a guest for breakfast .
thanks . why do you do it ?
what have you done with him ?
this was n't me .
he did it himself .
you were not here this morning .
but i did n't do this !
they will want to investigate .
how did you get him out of the pool ?
good morning .
mornin ' .
my name is whale . this is my house .
nice place .
and your name is -- ?
boone . clayton boone .
death before dishonor . what does it mean ?
just that i was in the marines .
a scorcher , as you yanks call it .
everything alright , mr. boone ?
i stink to high heaven right now .
or would you prefer a beer ?
no . iced tea 's fine .
these are your paintings ?
what ? oh yes .
excuse me , but -- are you famous ?
if you have to ask --
but some of these look familiar .
and that 's a rembrandt .
tell me , do you like motion pictures ?
no , i was merely a director here .
yeah ? what were some of your movies ?
the others were done by hacks .
making a couple of famous movies like those .
please , mr. boone . help yourself .
what did she mean by going flooey ?
i returned recently from a stay in hospital .
what was wrong ?
but you have a marvelous head .
huh ?
have you ever modeled ?
you mean , like posed for pictures ?
sat for an artist . been sketched .
what 's to sketch ?
and your nose . very expressive .
broke is more like it .
but expressively broken . how did it happen ?
football in college .
you went to university ?
i dropped out to join the marines .
it 's a great deal to ask of someone .
you mean -- you really want to draw me ?
nothing else ?
sure . i could use the extra dough .
they 're showing one of your movies tomorrow night .
you do n't say ? which picture ?
`` bride of frankenstein . ''
that shirt , mr. boone .
it 's new .
i 'm not wearing an undershirt .
would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness ?
take a picture , it lasts longer .
feel free to remove your boots and socks .
used like butter on bread .
sounds like something you feed the dog .
we kept ours in a crockery jar .
your family ate dripping ?
are you also from the slums , mr. boone ?
so glad you are free for lunch .
do you mind ?
is this david 's doing ?
this david 's a friend ?
watched it with some friends .
did you now ?
i liked it . we all did .
did anyone laugh ?
no .
pity . people are so earnest nowadays .
why ? was it supposed to be funny ?
did you kill anyone ?
that 's something to be proud of .
any jerk with a gun can kill someone .
did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand ?
no . i could have , though .
how free is your schedule this afternoon ?
to sit for me ?
ca n't today .
i do n't feel like sitting still today .
fingers are a bit stiff today .
you ever been married , mr. whale ?
so you had a wife ?
does that surprise you ?
no , i -- you 're a homosexual .
if one must have a clinical name .
i 'm not , you know .
what way might that be ?
so we understand each other ?
can i see what you did so far ?
you 'll have to remove your shirt .
sorry . not today .
but we have to match the other sketch .
you have a steady companion ?
not at the moment .
why not ?
very well put .
ah . a philosopher .
thoreau with a lawnmower .
because you wanted to be free ?
it was to be my masterpiece .
what happened ?
do you miss it ?
the dirty little secret of a nervous producer .
how long were you ... ?
and pricks . hard , arrogant pricks --
would n't you like to get in the pool ?
you first .
what convinced you to come back ?
i guess i like your stories .
everybody has stories to tell .
not me .
i 'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes .
how did you overcome that ?
not fear . more like disgust .
there 's no people like you in my crowd .
no teammates in football ? no comrades in korea ?
you 're talking through your hat now .
i was in the foxholes myself .
you were a soldier ?
this was world war i ?
but chastely , like a schoolboy .
not this lane . not today .
i did n't --
you 're the one who started it .
what do you want from me ?
you asked me to model . remember ?
please . why do n't you go ?
what do you want ?

i bet . going into people 's homes .
it 's nice that you can make that choice .
what happened ?
about what ?
about us .
baby , what is it ?
i 'm thirsty .
it 's the middle of the night , sweetie .
a man scared me .
a man ? was it a dream ?
it 's great !
so you do n't have anything concrete ?
a whiff of perfume on his shirt .
have you just plain asked him ?
i 've asked him what 's wrong .
i 'm getting such weird vibes lately .
rita , he 's only twelve years old ,
i could take a cab on the way home .
i do n't think he came in last night .
did n't you feed him this morning ?
where 'd he go ?
honey --
honey , it 's a whole new budget .
but it 's what we want .
you could have a pool to cool off in .

did you find a sword ? an old sword ?
it was robbed this morning .
it 's unbelievable .
we 're stepping on their toes of this one .
tough .
it 's not a homicide , lieutenant .
this ties in with nash .
we do n't have any proof of that .
nothing .
he had to come from somewhere .
i think it was england .

you ?
he died at anothers hand .

i learned my fill from romeriz .
the prize hardly seems worth the cost of it .
must you do that ?
what ?
sing .
i am merely enjoying it .
ca n't you enjoy it quietly ?
you know what you 're problem is ?
you listen but , you do not hear .
i hear you .
the river .
that 's all ?
it 's going to be a long one .
that is what bothers me .
i 'm leaving .
leaving what ?
maybe myself .

i hope our paths cross again .
i 'm sure they will .
as friends -- always as friends .
in the end it could be you and me .

i remember you .
i was wondering if i could talk to you ?
are you a cop ?
no . i 'm an archaeologist .
what do you want ?
corpses ?
yes . how did you know ?
he was wearing a bullet proof vest .
bullet proof vests do n't bleed .
if it 's good advice .
go home . stay out of this .
where did you get it ?
you 're hurt .
i 'll be fine .
why did he call you macleod ?
because it 's my name .
then who 's russell nash ?
you are a very persistent woman , miss hillman .
why do you stare at me like that ?
i do n't have any answers for you .
who was that man last night ?

good evening .
you 're twenty minutes late .
you did n't answer my question .
where are you from ?
i 'm just trying to place you .
because i do n't give up all my secrets ?
how come you wanted to meet tonight ?
that makes you uncomfortable ?
my interest in coming here is profession .
is it ?
yes -- it is .
alright . in the shop you mentioned something about --
do you know who they are ?
have you told lieutenant bedsoe your theory ?
no .
that would mean they 'd been trapped in there --
-- for three hundred years .
people do n't live for three hundred years .
would you like to see it ?
i 've seen it .
you wanted the truth -- now you have it .
where will you go now ?
it will end tonight .
must you fight him ?
he 's in there !
be careful , conner .
what now ?
a little friendly pr never hurt .
where is the film crew from the british museum ?
we 're holding the workers down below .
why ?
someone broke into the cavern last night .
how could they get by him ?
we found him this morning .
what 's that next to him ?
it 's a remarkable duplication .
i do n't think it is a duplication .
it has to be .
you stayed here again last night ?
i was working on the cataloging .
jennifer , there is more to life than work .
it 's been what ... two hundred years ?
highlander -- i had hoped it would be you .
i am stronger than you , highlander .
that 's what the kurgan said .
i can wait a little longer .
why did you wait ?
we are the last of our kind , macleod .
it will not end tonight .
you know it 's not safe here for you .
it is n't over , is it , conner ?
no .
how can that be ?
is there anything else you need ?
i 'm glad you 've come home , conner .
would you care for some water , conner ?
do n't leave us , conner .

mrs. rand .

but , mrs. rand --
what are you doing here ?
she boiled the water from then on .
but you did n't have to come up here .
you mean too much to us here .
mrs. rand ...
they 'll have to believe you .
does she suffer ?
she can never be cured ?
i 've never heard of a cure .
is this disease common in the tropics ?
miss connell 's testimony will be very important .

-- but , you 're an american ?
paul went to school in england .

where do you think you 're going ?
six ounces -- ?
it 's one of the funniest stories --
do n't let it bother you so , wes .

i thought they might cure her .
why did you do it ?
why should that mean anything to you ?
she was beautiful .
so far as i know -- it is true .

what do you want to talk about ?
we 'll talk when we get back to seattle .
you know my plan of action .

that 's all i want .
think about what you 're doing ...
your friend 's all business .

the other guy ?
how should i know ? ...
ran like hell to go to him ...
i do n't know .
you do n't know .
thought i smelled something .
i never met anyone from seattle before .
you 're not missing much .
i was her best friend .
best friend ?
since grade school .
that 's a long time .
knew everything about each other .
you want me to take you somewhere ?
hey ...
you and kay were like sisters ?
that 's what i said .
no ...
i do n't know .
you do n't know .
it was like some big fucking secret !
who ?
my arm !
who ?
she used some stupid code name .
no game .
thought you might find that .
down at the station ?
she was only seventeen .
but she was an attractive girl .
i suppose .
no .
but you wanted to .
you gave her gifts .
yes .
expensive dresses . a heart necklace .
yes .
does n't sound like a mentor to me .
what about him ?
randy stetz is in jail .
told you i could write an ending .
i thought maybe we could talk some more .
there 's nothing more to talk about .
what the hell do you know ?
i told you that was an accident !
then so was mine ...
do n't you pull that shit with me .
could n't get it up , walter ?
yes . like that .
this an accident , walter ?
where 's your back-up ?
no back-up .
you 're not following procedure .
wild card .
monstrous .
yes , and very beautiful .
jaded ingenues , amusing themselves with make- believe ...
we had feared we were the only ones ...
so you have the answers ...
ah ! you have questions ?
what are we ?
nothing if not vampires ...
who made us what we are ?
that is a picture , nothing more .
you mean we are not children of satan ?
then there is nothing .
and perhaps this is the only real evil left ...
then god does not exist ...
nothing , leading to nothing .
he knew nothing . he just did n't care .
i was waiting for you ...
claudia is dear to me . my ... daughter .
your lover .
no , my beloved , my child .
if you say so . you are innocent .
she feels she 's in danger from the others .
she is .
but why ?
then blame the one who made her ...
santiago thinks you did .
we want no quarrel with him .
without any of those answers you so longed for ?
you said there were none .
how quickly they perish of their own will .
we can do that ?
you see too clearly . you see too much .
that 's what the one who made me said .
and the vampires of the theatre ?
are these not the answers you came for ?
yes ... my god ...
lestat must have wept when he made you --
lestat ! you knew lestat !
where is she ? where 's claudia ?
not without claudia . where is she ?
i ca n't save her .
you must save her ! you have no choice .
i could n't prevent it .
they feared you . you wanted it to happen .
louis , i swear i did not .
you did n't even warm them , did you ?
no .
and yet you knew what i would o .
from the terrible dawn .
you were their leader . they trusted you .
your melancholy eyes ...
more .
i 'm not your daughter .
why always on this night ?
i did n't realise .
you should throw them away .
or there would be twice as many .
but you 're the fairest by far .
which of you made me the way i am ?
you would be something other than you are ?
and if i cut my hair again ?
it will grow back again !
stop her louis !
tell me how it was done ! ! ! !
you irritate me ! your very presence irritates me !
does it ?
is that supposed to frighten me ?
not you my dear .
but you upset my plans .
stop pestering me then !
where did you find them ?
i thought of you when i saw them .
absinthe ? you gave then absinthe ?
laudanum !
do n't louis --
louis , put me in my coffin ...
i want more .
how did you learn to write , claudia ?
you know what he calls you ? merciful death .
he jests .
why does he call you that ?
claudia ! you did that ?
you want me to be a doll forever ?
claudia - do n't -
you ... fed on me ?
and have been every night hereafter .
you both did it ?
now 's the time to leave him .
lestat . oh , god forgive us .
he 's dead , claudia , dead .
what would he have liked , louis ?
do n't mock , claudia ...
he deserved to die .
he gave me this life , whatever it is .
louis , look at me .
hush , claudia , hush now my dear -
it ca n't be -
the ship is sailing wihout us !
how do i look ?
is that what you still think i am ?
yes .
it was the pale shadow of killing .
claudia , you torture yourself .
whereas i must be the duckling forever .
dolls never change either .
you know her ?
make a doll of her in turn ?
this is nonsense .
and lots of drops to drink .
and the audience think it is paint .
she 's no vampire .
this is no performance .
this is monstrous !
i loathe it !
what danger ?
do you think i would let them harm you ?
danger hold you to me .
and we are in danger , not you .
never .
when he put me in that trance ...
so you felt it too !
he can protect us , claudia .
and i will suffer for it no longer !
i can not do it !
but you know i must leave you louis ...
but if she dies ...
we are now even .
they would have killed you -
then my luck would have changed .
you want death ? is it death you want ?
what are you doing in my house ?
you 're not afraid of anything , are you ?
what do you want from me ?
diane ! ! ! !
death which you can now destroy ...
give it to me ! ! !
vampires . we thrive on blood .
we 'll start with him .
how do you mean , start ?
let 's call that a start .
i ca n't do it .
that 's who you are .
your perfect . your bitter and you 're strong .
you really want to be with them ?
kill me . kill me like you promised -
did i hear a yes ?
you 're sure ?
it will take twenty minutes at most .
come , you 're going to feed now .
take him .
the crucifix -
what have i done ?
dear god , what have i done ?
it ca n't be ...
you 'll become accustomed to things all too quickly .
i know . it gets cold so fast .
fascination ...
it 's possible .
have you ever been caught ?
she 's perfect for you . go ahead .
but how do you know ?
read her thoughts .
i ca n't .
you 've condemned me to hell .
here all one needs is a pair of fangs .
paris ? you came from paris ?
as did the one who made me .
we can dine in splendour !
for each and every human life i have respect .
you fool , what have you done ?
where are we ?
what a vulgar fiend ?
what do you imagine you are louis ?
lestat , she 's alive ! ! ! !
the girl , lestat -
why do you do this lestat ?
lestat - finish this -
unless i make her one of us ...
no ! ! !
you do n't want it to go on .
i felt an end to the craving .
she 's here , your wounded one .
what are you saying ?
you are the instrument of satan !
she wants you to be happy .
you are the instrument of satan !
no ... you come back to me louis ...
i 've dreamed of your coming ...
that 's all past , lestat .
you always were the strong one .
i bring you no harm .
it 's only a siren ...
they make the night brighter than the day !
and they frighten you ?
but there 's no dark anymore .
i need your forgiveness , louis .
i 've had a very unusual life .
i 've got a pocket full of tapes .
you followed me here , did n't you ?
you seemed interesting . is this where you live ?
it 's just a room ...
so shall we begin ? what do yo do ?
you mean this literally , i take it ?
and then you began to speak .
well , what a lucky break for me .
drink my blood ?
that you 're a vampire ? you really think ...
let me turn on the light .
but i thought vampires did n't like the light .
how did you do that ?
you 're not lying to me , are you ?
i was twenty-four - younger than you are now .
yes .
you said the slave had a crucifix ...
oh , that rumour about crosses ?
you ca n't look at them ...
and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes .
the story about stakes through the heart ?
as you would say today ... bull shit .
what about coffins ?
you loved yvette ...
can a vampire feel love ?
you loved your wife , surely .
shall we go on ?
he did it to make you stay with him !
but why did you tell her ?
how could i not ? she had to know .
and did you lose her ? did she go ?
did he die in the fire ?
but one of our kind ? not a whisper .
no vampires in transylvania ? no count dracula ?
lestat escaped the fire !
no ... it ca n't end like that ...
just empty ?
i 've failed again , have n't i ?
no ...
you promise to care for her then ?
yes ...
yes .
a doll ?
and the child who did die ?
do you hear me ?
what can i do for you ?
you 're in 201 and 202 .
is that bad ?
wait ... did you say off-season ?
what about a radio ?
sorry . emergencies only .

i thought you were out of town !

i think i just really hurt ray 's feelings .
there 's nothing between will and me .

you do n't have to prove anything .
are you okay ?
go where ?
we 're to film him for the evening news .
nobody told me .
can you make them do tricks ?
they 're not tricks . they 're behavior patterns .
fine . have them do some .
they 're nervous and skittish right now .
okay now . have flipper flip or something .
they 're dolphins .
i thought they were clever .
i can have them walk backwards .
no , no . that wo n't do .
i 'm sorry .
most likely one 's inside the other .
sharks are man-biters , mister hutton . not man-eaters --
it 's an orgy of food and blood .
i 'd like to try .
you can get killed !
they 're born killers !
i will .
well , then i 'm going to film it .
i want that shark alive .
you look like an orange worm .
shark bait . draws them over for closeups .
something to munch on in case things get dicey .
we 're taking that shark alive !
i insist you get rid of that bomb .
how 's sleeping beauty ?
should be coming out of it soon .
could be a new dance ... walking the shark .
thanks for helping .
not at all .
why are you ?
i like it when they wake up .
so do i . but for different reasons .
very skillful indeed .
skillful ? i missed my first shot .
some miss all their shots .
somebody could have gotten hurt .
you 're a strange man , mr. hutton .
that 's because i am the shark .
by continuing to destroy fish , man destroys himself .
i think that you and i are natural enemies .
hello . i think his nap 's over .
get ready to go .
believe me , i am .
well , doctor . you 've got your shark .
he 's big as a bloody bus !
she , mister hutton .
i think they 'll come out now .
they still seem nervous .
he 's a young one .
when did this happen ?
we moved it too soon .
do n't blame yourself .
it was a good try ...
not good enough .
give me a ride ?

i understand you fancy yourself an author .
i 'm kafka -- i work upstairs in accident --

you 're a friend of eduard raban 's .
why would you suppose so ?
oh -- well , i thought he once mentioned --
hello again .
i 've never seen you here before .
he did n't tell you ?
no .
a better friend than me .
i suspected that he -- well .
what ?
how long were you and eduard --
this will always be the ghetto .
he was identified by his wallet .
and you believe everything the authorities tell you .
are you free tonight ?
you almost married recently , did n't you ?
last year . i -- it was broken off .
eduard wanted to marry me .
and you ... ?
-- i do n't know the musil district .

where you 've been employed for seven years .
how was eduard ...
could he swim ?
i do n't know .
was he depressed ?
he had no family either .
he was n't a lonely man , though .
what makes you think so ?
unless you have something more to add .
maybe it 's true then what she said .
do you ?
-- i was just trying to finish some work !
you 're very good ham actors .
-- just doing our job .
... why take me into your confidence ?
that 's < u > mad < /u > .
eduard is no longer the only casualty .
... a piece of paper ...
may i ask where your two warders are ?
`` raban '' did you say ?
where have i heard that name ?
orlac is an account ?
they gave him a posthumous medal .
where do our records go to in the castle ?

i do n't get you .
ligourin : how could you do it ?

i am a fan .
your court order , dr. allen .
you know i 'm not comfortable with this .
but your patient is legally entitled to it .
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures .
maya is eminently qualified .
there is a medical explanation for everything that happened .
satan is not some creature .
give me time to get some proof .
he will . he has great faith .
is he going to be okay ?
father , i have nowhere else to stay .
you 'll do it ?
how 're you doing ? looking lovely as always .
the only certainty i believe in is death .
what is it ?
something he said , just before ...
he spoke to you ?
yeah . it did n't make any sense .
not eve my own life .
you fucking bastard .
now it 's our turn .
so all that bullshit about god and faith .
everything you said , everything you did .
you raised me , like a son .
you killed my parents .
-- you would n't last five minutes .
we 've only got a few more hours .
do n't worry ... about the transformation , maya .
so ... we won ?
we won because christ ... triumphed over satan ?
that satan ...
satan is the weak one .
how many weeks are you honey/
this is how he says `` goodbye ? ''
you need his blood-type . like right away .
well i know he 's come here before .
what 's his name ?
peter ... peter kelson .

two negatives always make a positive .
may i help you ?
peter kelson ?
yes ... and you are ?
you were brilliant .
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil .
not pure evil . that 's correct .
it 's the extreme of self-denial .
which , to a narcissist , is impossible .
listen , ms ... ?
you realize how rarely they make that ruling ?
i do .
he 's pretty amazing .
i 'll bet .
so ... what did you think of the tape .
i think you gave me the wrong one .
what do you mean ?
you 're sure ? there was nothing ?
so what 'd i miss ?
i had to .
you might not believe me ...
we need to talk .
what the fuck is going on ?
you are that man , peter .
what ? ! ? !
it spelled your name .
unless you trick him .
trick him .
it 's like birdson had a split personality .
you should think about getting professional help .
to sanctify you .
i 'm not going to be drawn into this .
are you sure your parents are your birth parents ?
i do n't understand what 's going on .
and i certainly was n't born of incest .
so what ?
one baptism ? he 's your mother 's only brother
do you know your parents ' blood types ?
i do n't believe any of this .
we needed to know all we could .
get up ! !
peter , let go of the chair !
you okay ?
when 's your birthday ?
peter , what time were you born ?
there 's nothing else here .
what 's the bible for ?
what do you mean ?
i 'm scared i 'm slipping back .
we 're going to do this .
you have to say that .
life 's tenuous .
no oxygen to the brain .
maybe that 's my problem .
what about after ?
plenty of time .
what are these ?
extra apartment keys . what 's it matter ?
be right back . do n't go anywhere .
what can i do ?
i saw it in his eyes .
the ark sank and the sun set ?
how much time do we have ?
oh , peter .
good seeing you again .
hello ?
i know who he is .
maya ? what do you mean ?
and what are you thinking we should do now ?
i 've filed a report with father frank .
a lot of good that 'll do .
we need all the help we can get .
they 're not going to help us .
there 's nothing to be done until then .
it 's useless ... look at him .
we need to be sure .
you do n't want to face it .
look , john , i 'm facing it .
you know what ? you can go .
the sign of the devil .
get out of here .
i plan to . you want a tip ?
lem me guess . the lottery .

d'artagnan , arrest them all !
what do you propose to do ?

what are they doing ?
the prison of belle sur .
what is that ?
a body .
you have a keen sense of this man .
who is he , aramis ?
tomorrow .
he who is not with us is against us .
that is your plan ? it is ludicrous !
i have it all worked out .
louis has an arrogance , a manner --
those can be adopted --
and people close to him , who --
it is phillippe 's as well !
how is he ?
aramis --
more wine ! !
phillippe is like a child , he --
three days .
you grow fond of him . that 's good .
go on .
now . you were saying ?
but -- what is he doing ?
poor phillippe !
where are you going ? !
we 'll be back soon . be ready .
phillippe can learn in time , but --
what you 're asking is impossible !
bloody hell ...
he seeks redemption .
you 're a fool !
so what has changed ?
then to the bastille .
a simple theological discussion .
and when we saw injustice , we fought it .
no ! stop --
i will defend him with my life .
pull them back , d'artagnan .
you ca n't do it .
pull them back !
everyone back .
why do n't we charge them ?
ca n't you see i 'm praying ?
there are more important things than tits .
forgiveness .
where are we ?
mother of god !
it is also a place of burial .
a tomb ? we 're in a tomb ?
and why are you so glum ?
athos ! he looks exactly like ... exactly like ...
it began on the night when louis was born .
i carried the child of the king .
louis !
no , not louis !
he confuses me --
now get some rest .
coming ?
what use am i ?
we go someplace dangerous .
who ?
this excitement 's given me an appetite .
today is the day .
who does ?
d'artagnan , unready ?
d'artagnan . ''
you are right . but it is a trap .
it worked !
i get so confused ...
mother 's ring . i ca n't take this .
but -- are you sure ?
michelle can not possibly accept !
i want to die remembering that .
at the front ? ! no .
goodbye , father . i am sorry .
d'artagnan !
it 's been too long .
mon dieu ! driving the youngsters hard , eh ?
three ? four ?
i heard your playing .
if the young woman truly loves raoul --
you knew and that 's why you came .
i came to try to bring you hope .
raoul is everything to me .
i know .
athos , please ... !
get out of my way .
where are you going ?
the king killed my son !
he has no honor !
he lies . he is here to trap us .
recent hours have been a shock .
but a king ...
the desire for vengeance ... can be a poison .
i am so sorry ! forgive me , i --
or do you say this because of your son ?
how did you know -- ?
whose rooms are those ?
the room of the king 's favorite mistress ?
phillippe ... ?
you were the man in the iron mask .
are you hungry ?
who came ?
the old man and woman called me ... phillippe .
your majesty ...
a personal nature ?
a son of your own ?
or lecture me ? !
love yourself , and --
at least help raoul .
silence ! i order you !
i will consider it . now leave me .
what did you see ?
your majesty ... ?
seal them all , every one !
it shall be done , your majesty .
even the bedchamber passages ! let none remain !
i was told this impostor was dead !
... you knew you had a double ?
get out of my way .
forgive this man , this prisoner ... your brother .
forgive ? !
forgive them .
where is michelle ?
continue .
i must ask you to accompany me .
... the ball ... continue .
phillippe !

he did -- but captain d'artagnan blocked his way .
do you want athos arrested , your majesty ?
now . where is d'artagnan ?
out directing the search for the traitors .
magnificent valor ...
exactly why it should be given away .
sire , i --
sire ! i -- how did you --
what is that ?
... nothing .
raoul ... is in love ...
the food does n't please you ?
it 's lovely . it 's just ...
i ... we are humble people ...

you are beautiful . you know you are .

a.i . ? you mean artificial intelligence ?
you 're going to need it .
for what ?
this is incredible . i know kung fu .

do you know why you did n't make it ?
i thought it was n't real .
do you understand , neo ?
i think i do .
did you see the woman in the red dress ?
yeah .
but now i believe that is going to change .
set down in there .
she 's been with us since the beginning .
the beginning ?
of the resistance .
and she knows what ? everything ?
she would say she knows enough .
how does she know ?
there is only what is .
she can help you find the path .
she helped you ?
yes .
what did she tell you ?
what do you believe in ?
i do n't know anything anymore , morpheus .
that 's why we 're here .
in my gut .

brave sir robin ran away .
i did n't .
bravely ran away , away .
so ?
you do n't tell her majesty how you feel .
i speak as i find , archie .
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting ?
how much ?
seventy a year .
not bad , not bad .
how about yourself ?
sixty .
wash his poultices for him ?
she 's hardly a full hamper herself .
it 's only grief makes her like she is .
is that not a bit long to be grieving ?
she loved him .
there 's love and there 's ...
what ?
you know what i mean .
which one of us is she flirting with ?
the good-looking one .
so ? someone 'll send it on ahead .
and she sent no word down ?
what are you doing ? !
i 'm getting dressed .
you 've got three broken ribs , man !
i 've got my duties to attend to .
you 're in no fit state to go anywhere .
she 'll be worried about me .
she 'll get over it .
you know nothing about her !
best friend !
aye .
what 's this ?
it 's a diary .
be careful who sees it .
you should have someone look after you .
the place is a mess .
i ca n't move to tidy .
she 's other people to look out for her .
what 's your name ?
mary taylor , sir .
have i seen you up in balmoral , mary ?
checked and locked , sir .
louder , girl !
checked and locked , sir .
hey , barney .
mr brown , sir --
i think there might be a stone in it .
yeah , yeah , i did .
good man . and is she all right ?
yeah .
and you know the queen 's riding tomorrow ?
yeah .
mr disraeli . ma'am .
what a pleasure to see you here .
he 's in sugar ... ?
no doubt you 've heard the rumors .
i take no account of gossip , your highness .
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy .
of course .
in nero marquino marble .
a situation ?
the tory party has always been our party .
du royaum uni .
it 's the queen 's decision .
i wish to see my mother .
she 's busy .
convey her a message .
do you know who you address , sir ?
whom you address .
well , everyone 's entitled to their opinion .
gesture ?
i thought , a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ?
why are you dressed for outdoors ?
mother ... .
it should be discouraged .
yes , but is n't midnight a little excessive ?
mama ...
mr. carter , the head butler , sits there .
this is my place .
by whose authority ?
we --
checked and locked , sir .
how will i know ?
i 'm sorry ?
how will i know what she requires ?
you 'll be sent a message .
who 'll bring it to me ?
her highness ' equerry .
do you ?
no .
go inside at once .
is that the queen 's request ?
she 'll need to sign dispatches before she retires .
that can wait till the weekend .
there are important papers from --
i believe that decision rests with her majesty .
what do you know about the highlands ?
i am a blank sheet .
do you hunt ?
occasionally .
dare say you can be taught .
to shoot perhaps , but not to kill .
then imagine it 's gladstone .
you sent for me .
you must miss such magnificent views .
i 'm fine .
you 're injured .
it 's nothing .
your wife should not have let you out .
i 'm not married .
oh .
still gives one a ridiculous thrill .
i would n't know .
surely --
what i do , i do for my queen .
was there never ambition ?
maybe , once .
then i envy yo .
i do what i do .
for her majesty .
aye .
but yourself ? what about john brown ?
i said . i serve the queen .
why do you think i keep her here ?
she wo n't change now .
they do n't see it .
see what ?
they are n't as watchful as you .
too busy looking after themselves .
the greasy pole .
no loyalty .
she 'll never understand it .
in time , she will .
mr brown .
ma'am .
you are here safely .
aye , ma'am .
you are well ?
i am .
and the pony ?
your family sent cards . it was much appreciated .
i forget his name .
archie .
yes . that will be company for you .
mr brown .
yes , ma'am .
then why do you persist in doing it ?
it 's a fine spot , ma'am .
aye , ma'am .
what are those ?
what ?
those , over there , there .
are they worth reading ?
i am told so .
who by ?
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming .
what does he know about the highlands ?
he has been attending at balmoral for many years .
but ponsonby thinks they are good .
we took a nip of whiskey .
to keep out the cold .
what is it , john ? john ?
must they always follow us ?
am i not safe enough with you , john ?
john ?
yes , ma'am ?
i was told you were in a fight .
yes , ma'am .
has someone seen to those bruises ?
ma'am ?
i leave for deeside --
all i 've ever thought about is you !
then why send me back to them ? !
it could 've been someone . it was before .
forgive me , gentlemen . i 'm late .
good of you to spare the time .
what can we do ?
you sell even more copies than mr dickens .
then they may read about me .
indeed , and for that they are eternally grateful .
is that such a terrible crime ?
this is my good john brown .
should we take it seriously ?
the cartoon or her majesty 's absenteeism ?
well , both .
the question is , do we need her ?
so ?
i see the prince of wales is here .
what did he want ?
we 're going to lose .
we need help . where is the old girl ?
who ?
she 's never been less popular .
time to wheel her out .
she 's refusing to leave balmoral .
what 's her excuse this time ?
you 're smiling .
a fine choice , sir .
she was drunk , i tell you .
erysipelas .
not too protracted , i hope .
the queen wishes to publish an account of him .
dear oh dear .
have you had a glance at the diary ?
yes .
i think i 'd best take it back .
where did you find it by the way ?
well , no rest for the wicked , henry .
we 're expecting brown this afternoon , ma'am .
i 'm sorry , ma'am ?
cold is good !
why am i being lectured in this way ? !
i asked what was wrong with my son .
just them ?
it 's mr brown , ma'am .
what is he doing there ?
he appears to be ... standing by his horse .
how long has he been there ?
well ?
mr brown is unable to attend today .
why ?
i believe he is unwell , ma'am .
unwell ?
i understand he was in a fight .
has he been hurt ?
how long has he been this sick ?
a few days , ma'am .
i have no wish to go riding .
please make sure it does not happen again .
it was most agreeable .
we were expecting you to return by six .
read it .
again ?
who told them that ?
i have no idea .
there is one other matter .
what is it ?
i have a letter , ma'am .
from whom ?
do i make myself clear ?
one must not let vanity overrule one 's appetite .
where is my son ?
prince albert is at windsor , ma'am .
why is he not here ?
he is sick , ma'am .
what is the matter with him ?
does that thing work ?
what do you mean ?
if you 're too late , the screamer comes .
how do you stop the screamer ?
just tell me the fucking riddle .
think you could print up those schematics ?
we 're having some problems with arcade ...
got ta time it right though .
what 's the question mark ?
how do you do that ?
but how can it change every time ?
dead ?
it 's really not all that important .
maybe he 's not dead .
he ?
maybe he 's alive inside the game .
nick , alex , how are we today ?
how 'd you know it was us ?
now what seems to be the problem ?
it 's the game , arcade .
something 's wrong with the game , mr. difford .
talk to me .
he thinks i 'm `` sublimating '' .
has anyone seen greg ?
sick ?
we always meet here , you know that .
what 's her problem ?
did you play arcade last night ?
he said you were going to have dinner ?
yeah ...
i 'm sure he 's up to something ...
hello ?
nick ...
it 's incredible ! i was just ...
i have to talk to you .
we are talking ...
no , in person . now .
it 's twelve-thirty !
what do you mean by `` weird '' ?
can you turn off the game ?
i 'm in the middle of it ...
happy ?
but it 's not arcade that 's doing it ...
it is .
so how did it know my name , then ?
i did not imagine it ! ! !
it turned itself back on , nick .
sorry . maybe i need the valium .
something 's happened to them .
they 're asleep . phone did n't wake them .
because i did n't know where else to go .
everything gets weird this late anyway , right ?
i think they 're gone ...
no way .
come on , nick .
well ?
where to now ?
i mean , am i paranoid or what ?
it does n't necessarily mean she 's ...
change the channel !
then leave her .
we ca n't ...
where do we go ?
that 's what i thought .
what ?
it 's everywhere .
it 's self-replicating ... it mimics life .
getting stronger . maybe it 's only localized now ...
... but then it hits the relay stations ...
we have to stop it from getting out .
it 's already out .
the police , then ...
then where do we go ? !
slip-stream .
what ?
you mean we learn the rules ...
virgin sacrifices ?
and make it quick , okay ?
what are you going to do ?
jesus christ !
you got the schematics ?
you know , like his point of origin ?
dante 's inferno .
alex ...
what are you looking for ?
it 's been taunting us ...
put in a quarter .
it does n't need a quarter .
you 're not coming , alex .
yes i am ...
!
you do n't get it , do you ?
what ?
i care about you .
i already have a boyfriend , nick .
you feel it ? it 's different this time .
okay . give us a kiss ?
one . in case ...
thanks . always wanted to do that .
yeah , well i figure these are unusual circumstances .
you watch the elapsed time and look for exits .
which way do you think level two is ?
the clock 's already ticking .
this was a piece of cake .
look out for fireflies .
shit ...
our time 's up .
what ? ! there 's nothing here !
what the fuck is that ? !
we ca n't reach that !
the screamer ?
christ ... no time ...
pretend you 're on a snowboard .
what is it ?
i know .
so tell me you 're okay , then .
i 'm okay .
and then keep on driving ?
go for it .
so how did you do it , alex ?
did you play the game ? !
yes ...
then we 'll go home ?
which way ?
it 's the wrong way !
it 's here ! ! !
what did he do to you ?
is that your question ?
the liar ... think !
you have no time . what is your question ?
i 'm thinking !
mom ? you 're alive ...
of course i am .
but i do n't understand ...
you know that , do n't you ?
did i die ?
each time you play , it changes its strategy .
that 's impossible .
`` escape '' ?
am i saving a princess ? fighting zombies ?
so how do i start ?
so what do you think ?
we 're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
it means she 's screwed up .
cool .
can you say anything but `` cool '' ?
and death is certain if you enter , beware .
where should i take you ?
so start at the beginning ...
give her a chance , will you ?
adam , where are you ?
what 's going on , cynthia ?
they sent everybody home .
what did you say ?
they fired everyone .
you 'd better get down here adam !
i 'm going home .
i 'm going home cynthia .
there must be something we can do .
someone 's shut off my money !
i know . where are you adam ?
what do you mean `` you know '' ?
and ?
you 're broke !
but i 'm not broke .
where are you ?
do you know somebody called the the cowboy ?
the cowboy ? ?
cynthia ... what 's going on ?
it 's been a very strange day .
you got ta be kidding ?
will you meet with him ?
cynthia ... that would not be a good idea .
so what 's the problem ?
there is no problem .
you 'd better fix this , ray ! ! !
howdy !
beautiful night .
kinda anxious to get to it are ya ?
is that somethin ' you agree with ?
i agree with what you said ... truly .
will ya do that for me ?
okay , i 'm thinking .
can ya do that for me ?
what do you want me to do ?
how many drivers does a buggy have ?
okay .
you understand that ?
i understand .
so then ... until we meet again .

no ma'am , not this time .
he 's not in the hole . we looked .
power cells .
just in case , you know , this actually --
had it with deals .
but i just wanted to say --
that 's somethin ' right there .
why are n't we still following them ?
what do you see ? riddick ?
riddick ? what the hell are you --
i circled once to buy some time to think .
back to the ship , huh ?
get out of our way .
how many you see ?
one or two .
just the torch-bearers .
as fast as you can .
you sure you can keep --
he 's up there pissing on me !
riddick , please !
strong survival instinct . admire that in a woman .
just come with me !
they 're already dead . get on board .
step aboard , carolyn .
i ca n't ... .i ca n't ... .
here . make it easy on you .
do n't do this to me ... .
just give me your hand .
but they ... they could still be ... .
you 'd die for them ?
i would try for them .
you barely know them .
what do my eyes see ?
just a suggestion , but perhaps we should flee .
there ... .
like the light is scalding it .
spirits . anything over 45 proof burns well .
how many bottles ?
not sure . ten ?
would they burn ? if you got a receipt ?
possibly .
just a detour . he 'll get us there .
can we switch ?
hey .
hey , who ?
amazing . i 'm johns .
and him ?
big evil ?
we just keep him locked up forever ?
already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
is he really that dangerous ?
s'matter ?
toward sunset .
what ?
probably makes it worse . dehydrates you even more .
no , no , i wanted to get away .
better keep moving ... .
hey . you can tell me , carolyn .
promise me . swear to me you wo n't --
so now you know .
did n't bite .
but we might be able to adapt --
sorry . thought i heard something .
like what ?
he used that ?
sir shiv-a-lot . he likes to cut .
so why is n't it all bloody ?
let 's just be sure .
we got ta go down and find it .
well , do n't ask me to .
thought you did n't believe his story .
nobody else is going down but me , okay ?
but we 'll need more cells .
five total to launch .
nobody wants your theories on --
60 years ago .
let 's wait on the power cells .
you said there was a deal .
let him go if that 's what it --
i never said i was .
so what ?
stop it , stop it , stop it !
smoke screen for what ?
for your own fear .
how much you weigh , johns ?
what the hell 's it matter ?
how much ?
you know that , do n't you ?
he will leave you all out there to die .
so you noticed too ?
we are n't completely stupid .
now let 's just go back to the ship .
are you fucking high again ? just listen to --
just shut up , okay ?
we 're just walking ghosts to her .
we can not go through there ... .
might take a few days to --
so what the bloody hell happened , anyways ?
well ? is it just the pump ?
before nightfall but while it 's cooler .
what , you 're goin ' off , too ?
why did i fall on you ?
captain 's dead . owens too .
you mean that `` load '' of passengers ?
owens !
you know who muhammad was ?
some prophet guy ?
frightening thought .
one is all ?
was n't a natural die-off .
hasan ?
even in the dark ?
imam . slow down .

little more space 'tween us and them .
i would rather we all stay --
the sled as a shield ... .
no , no , no ... .
has anyone seen the young one ? ali ?
where 's mr. johns ?
which half ?
what 're you doin ' ?
blessing you like the others . it 's painless .
and pointless .
and i absolutely hate the fucker .
he will be with us . nonetheless .
suleiman !
get the girl back under . keep going .
suleiman !
new mecca ... .
you understand that , do n't you ?
`` god is great , '' yes ?
we crossed our own tracks .
she 's the captain , we should listen to --
... then we saw this .
a toast to whatever he just said .
what the hell are these ?
well , just a skiff . disposable , really .
very big beads .
found somethin ' worse than me , huh ?
the way it coulda gone and did n't .
say that again .
you help us get off this rock ... .
you 'd cut me loose , boss ?
are you fuckin ' kidding me ?
i 'd rather piss glass .
well , you got the big gauge .
think about that reward , johns .
i 'm willing to take a cut in pay .
you said `` clear . ''
said `` looks clear . ''
well , what 's it look like now ?
girl 's not cut .
ai n't all of us gon na make it .
a good thing , right ?
not if i 'm the one .
like a bucket of chum .
we can drag the body behind us .
what 's her name , anyway ?
an ' this ?
so much for your nightfall .
not a star-jumper .
you were tryin ' to kill him too .
take it .
what , it 's broken ?
dr. zaius --
did you forget our appointment , cornelius ?
how did you know we 'd come here ?
some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
the evidence is contestable .
no sir , i have n't forgotten .
seal the cave ?
well , taylor -- we 're all fugitives now .
do you have any weapons ?
the best . but we wo n't need them .
you still do n't believe me , do you ?
the emblem of my countrymen .
nothing .
where does the river lead ?
depend on it .
put down that gun .
taylor , i 'd rather you -
what are you doing there ?
we thought you were ... . inferior .
besides ... ... his culture is our culture .
do you have to work tonight ?
no .
the one i was telling you about .
what 's so special about him ?
look -- she remembers .
remembers what ?
the blood transfusion .
it 's a stunt . humans do n't write .
do n't you believe your own eyes ?
now , just a minute --
i do n't know .
flight is a scientific impossibility .
'then how do you account for me ? ,
and i 'm not going to try .
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
the evidence was very meager --
well , maybe they 're not .
i wo n't get into that battle .
oh , cornelius , show some strength !
it floats on the air . try it .
got your sensors ?
yo !
geiger counter ?
yo !
we 've enough food and water for three days .
but how long is a day ?
any sign of dangerous ionization ?
no .
which direction ?
that way .
any particular reason ?
and another . and another .
which one was wearing the strange clothes ?
will he live ?
this place is dirty , doctor .
you made it . why ca n't i ?
therefore , he has no rights under ape law .
state your case , mr . prosecutor .
come to the point , dr. honorius .

she comes along too .
zira does n't want your female .
i want her .
but i 'm not taking any orders --
should n't we be moving on ?
always giving orders . just like every other adult .
how do you feel , lucius ?
it 's a matter of values --
will you do me a favor ? no orders .
where will you go ?
lucius .
i think you 're making a mistake .
that 's the boy . keep 'em flying .

twelve hundred years ago .

tennessee someplace . hill country .
well he ai n't normal that 's fo sure .
i do n't want to hear about it jackson .
you do n't want to hear about it ?
i just do n't give a shit anymore .
right ...
no thanks , i 've seen seattle .
and where you 're going .
how far does this train go ?
vancouver , b.c .
perhaps i do n't take it so lightly .
it 's pretty crowded you know .
should i have a reservation ?
i live there .
well..
how long for ?
i really do n't know .
indefinitely ?
i do n't know .
balcony and everything . lovely view too .
very nice mitchell turns .
no thanks ?
thank you .
had n't put in a good word for you ?
i 'm supposing .
i 've got fifty bucks to throw away .
not tonight .
we have some nice places around vancouver .
i have n't been invited .
do n't i even get my face slapped ?
would you mind ?
she wants to meet you . miss mayfield .
i think i 'd like to dance .
i think you 're drunk .
good evening , miss .
unless you charter a plane .
they might think i was running away from something .
good morning . can i do something for you ?
i 'm miss mayfield . is mr. campbell here ?
bank ?
i 'm only killing time .
no , please .
we often have a double up here .
your liquor laws..
i was up there . too noisy . bored .
i see .
it might be worth a martini to you .
i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties .
anybody in the hotel 's welcome .
what did you say his name was ?
but.. if you really want a good dry martini..
as i said before ...
they just keep me here to amuse the guests .
and do you amuse the guests ?
are you really going to drink that stuff ?
you 're drinking it .
would it make you anymore amusing ?
whatever you say .
but i 'm sure you 'd rather be alone .
i get tired of it .
do you think i do n't ?
thanks for the fresh air . that felt good .
dance ?
you said it was n't a tragedy .
the world is full of larry mitchells .
he got in here how ?
they 'll know whether he killed himself .
i do n't .
how did you meet him ?
nice of him .
he eased himself in .
what else ?
it does n't matter .
you tried to run away .
there was n't any plane .
want a spike in it ?
there was n't any plane .
bad ?
bad enough .
he could hardly help suspecting you .
what time is it ?
certainly not to me .
just who are you , anyway ?
he did n't like it .
cold ?
is this the best you can do ?
want to dance ?
dance ? here ?
why not ?
they know you here -- know your name .
he was in the hotel lobby .
i did n't notice him .
he 's following us .
he said no -- he meant no .
then he 's got to be a detective .
could n't be .
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ?
absolutely sure .
you do n't know who he is ?
us ?
all right -- following me .
why ?
there 's nothing i can do about it .
that 's a silly remark is n't it ?
it still does n't matter if i kiss you ?
nothing matters .
that fellow hurt me .
so have i .
could you be a little more exact ?
i never saw him before .
i almost went to the police station instead .
no percentage in that .
they 're going to arrest me .
i know . killaine has a warrant .
how bad is it ? bad enough for --
how bad is the other thing ? the secret ?
where ? out there somewhere ?
they 'll look for you .
mr brandon 's a rather lonely man .
and betty mayfield --
no chance .
could n't they think of that ?
close the book . finis .
killaine ...
you can make coffee if you like .
we ca n't leave until near dark anyway .
do you have to leave the note ?
well ?
i 'll tell you when .
see anything ?
the moon is rising .
cold ?
wonder what ?
if you 're doing all this just for me .
to leave my -- my note .
we were all pretty stupid about you .
i do n't care to have that known .
but our records were a little against us .
what your father did does n't condemn you .
was he really following me -- or you ?
not this one . and not mitchell .
you-killed-him ?
maybe i could believe it . should i try ?
you 've out- smarted yourself .
mine ?
mitchell was dead enough .
you did n't kill him .
magruder does .
you think magruder wants to hang beside me ?
you could never tell about me .
would i want to ?
every time you see your face in the mirror --
and there 's you .
me ?
i think you mean that .
do you think i was faking ?
yes , miss .
very dry , please .
beer and ale only . canadian law .
beer ? well , all right .
beer or ale , miss ?
ale . i do n't mind .
mrs. west is a very emotional woman .
i do n't know her.. or particularly want to .
tell me about yourself , miss mayfield .
please answer my question .
you made a speech .
that 's an evasion and you know it .
why ? unhappy marriage ?
your family coat of arms , mr. killaine ?
regimental ! seaforth highlanders .
i 'm sorry .
what this ?
yes .
where 's you get it ?
deep blue ? i 'd call it grey-blue .
florida ?
we would n't have met at all .
you 've had dealings with the police before ?
is it a crime ?
was he very drunk when you last saw him ?
you were there when i last saw him .
but in the end , i 'll find out .
why ca n't you give me your confidence ?
you -- or the vancouver police department ?
we try to be decent .
you , least of all .
if i understand what you meant by that .
this is n't a very good place to talk .
i do n't want to talk .
i expected nothing else .
pretty ridiculous , is n't it ?
they call me jeff .
he had a habit of going through her bag .
looking for peanuts , i suppose .
there 's no indication you handled it .
a bad joke -- but better than tears .
but i wo n't do it myself .
you 've got a couple of hours , maybe .
to do what ?
i ca n't answer that .
what will they do to you ?
can i drop you somewhere ?
however much he might happen hate it .
i 'm not in love with you .
i know that .
but even if you were in love with me .
sometimes .
you 're that kind of man , jeff .
you 'd never have known .
we know everything .
he ; s not a murderer .
good morning , mr. brandon .
morning . any calls ?
mr. reed would like you to call him .
all right . get him .
says his business is personal .
mr. reed stepped out , mr. brandon .
you asked for it .
i 'm still asking . what do you want ?
you might want something from me .
private eye ?
all it takes is the folding .
what are your rates ?
i 'd need about $ 500 for a retainer .
what have you got on miss mayfield ?
bluff . you 've waited too long .
for five hundred , what do i get ?
i go home and paint the kitchen .
for two hundred ?
i stick around and wait for the five hundred .
you mentioned information .
you can hire me not to use it .
a thousand .
got it on you ?
got the information on you ?
why not here ?
hello killaine . you two come together ?
mr. killaine , mrs. west .
what 'll you have , margo ?
martini .
sometimes .
and without much discrimination .
you 've met him .
all right , let 's see the buzzer .
what 's a buzzer ?
so you 're not a cop .
what made you think that , mr. brandon ?
who told you my name ?
how are your teeth getting along ?
what 's this in favor of ?
what ?
everyone is so perfectly natural .
how 's life treating you ?
the usual grind .
round of golf saturday ?
hardly . who 's the girl ?
thank you .
i ought to know better .
could be .
it was lying where on the balcony ?
how about a cup of coffee ?
how are you two getting along ?
in case you want to have us followed .
i do n't .
time for a little chat ?
if it does n't take too long . drink ?
lovely view you have , have n't you ?
i never notice the view after the first week .
remember what somerset maugham said about it ?
very appealing , especially to a poor man .
could we discuss that some other time ?
how long since you saw her ?
a couple of hours .
i have a warrant for her arrest .
if you tried to help her get away --
would that make me a heel ?
you 'd be breaking the law .
does n't answer the question .
the only answer i have for you .
what toughened you up ?
information .
you do n't think she murdered mitchell .
it could have been an accident .
that could be told .
not if she knew she would n't be believed .
margo and her money .
or margo for that matter .
mitchell was too drunk .
uh-uh . no sale , killaine .
where is she ?
i ca n't interfere with the law .
the police do n't take anything for granted .
far too often . so long .
mostly just for the fun of it .
i tried it once . i lost my shirt .
i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .
i had a father who knew how to steal .
what ?
you asked me where it all came from .
hello , mitchell . having fun ?
do n't you like me anymore ?
lay off , ca n't you ?
find yourself a nice secluded park bench .
did i do something wrong ?
there is such a thing as good manners .
how would you know , brandon ?
want to walk out ... or get thrown out ?
you do n't throw guests out , brandon .
good afternoon , mr. campbell .
mr. mitchell .
a little something on account perhaps ?
rather more than a little something , mr. mitchell .
what are you doing here ?
i do n't think you locked your door .
what do you want ?
the hotel 's full of passkeys .
they always have another .
you nasty , sardonic --
none of us ever saw him again .
you lied . it was obvious .
i have .
everything points to her .
how do i know you did n't kill larry ?
with what motive ?
you hated him -- and i know why .
recently , then .
i 'm sure of that .
floater ?
not a floater . only just dead .
i 've got a murder to investigate .
and there 's nothing in his pockets .
that 's no drunk- rolling job .
i wish it did . but it doesn't
got a moment , inspector ?
or a second . i 'm not sure which .
goble and greer is the firm name .
greer wo n't give out .
send that ?
would you ?
what 's the face for , driscoll ?
i 'm looking for mr. brandon .
what would it look like ?
not too fat- not too thin .
what do i get for it ?
you get it 's brother .
sign your name across the flap .
open it and count it .
you in charge here ?
so it seems sergeant .
i supposed you knew her , too , inspector .
i 've met her .
so the shell ought to have gone over ?
anything special you 're looking for , inspector ?
i 'll know when i find it .
`` g.g . market one-eight-four-two . ''
not too hard , is it ?
was that about the right angle ?
i think so .
where 's the shell ?
such as ?
what do i do ? what would you do ?
do i know who lives down there ?
likely to be out of it for some time ?
pretty big chance , huh ?
this is the shell . what about the gun ?
well . what about it ?
if i leave it here ... .no suicide .
he could n't have arranged it .
no suicide .
did we ever really think it was suicide ?
wait for a mistake .
nothing connects them , but a telephone number .
do n't you take your hat off in elevators ?
may you what ?
oh nothing .
scotch and plain water , i think .
i never saw it before .
what about me ?
why do n't you ask her about the gun ?
i have n't seen mr. clarendon .
i am a fool .
love ! what a comedy !
you did n't play it for laughs last night .
did you ever have a serious operation ?
mortar shells are not funny , either .
is that a beastly thing to say ?
not if it clears the air .
it does . may i go now ?
i 'll investigate mr. clarendon 's financial position --
now , you 're being beastly .
i know .
i 'm interested in who handled it .
no doubt about that one .
how about magruder ?
he checks too .
that leaves two strangers .
so far .
try betty mayfield . the mitchell case .
mayfield ? she fit into this ?
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ?
the card says so , does n't it ?
he just flew in from toronto .
now about this mayfield girl ?
no .
where 's the girl now ?
i do n't know , sir .
this girl is a murderess , killaine .
have ye any comment , killaine ?
identification on possible , sir . not conclusive .
i think you 'd be entirely justified , sir .
but you still think she 's innocent .
i believe you won decorations during the war .
i 'm not one of them .
this is why i gave it to you .
you 'll grow out of that .
get out of here !
have a nice trip ?
so-so .
who 's the girl ?
her name 's mayfield . betty mayfield .
you do n't mind do you ?
why should i mind ?
you washed me up very thoroughly .
but you are helping me .
you wanted it that way .
and she 's rich , i hope .
i have n't the faintest idea . why ?
you ought to know why .
i was able to do her a small favor .
i have a rough idea .
for a long term .
what 'll we do about it , margo ?
i do n't even have my hotel bill .
that 's not very kind .
what 's this ?
what does it look like ?
how long have you had it ?
the canadian police might like to know about this .
take me ?
of course .
how about your new friend ?
i told you she 's just..
be back in an hour . right ?
right .
i forgot about calling for you .
after all , you got what you wanted .
and young . no thank you .
and you look very unsophisticated .
i am sorry to have kept you .
i hope he was n't a nuisance ?
i wondered --
are you a socialist , mr. penfield ?
yes .
to ann .
here i am lecturing you . have some pâté .
you 're kind to be so encouraging .
she has n't mentioned you .
yes .
well , i 'd hate to be a nuisance .
thank you .
you 'll have to chase them up .
tom is n't , i can tell you .
shall we go ?
they want to know what went wrong .
what went wrong ?
thank you .
now first of all , tell us your name .
but i 'm not an interviewer or a correspondent .
terrific .
have a good holiday ?
coming to the meeting ?
i 'm not sure i can face it .
how 's mary ?
it 's all over .
aha . james giving some woman the old heave-ho .
committed to memory . forever .
attributed ?
of course .
who was the old one anyway ?
congratulations . who with ?
one of the best chapters in the book .
hello .
no thanks . i 'd like to break away --
i 'll have some of that .
... break away completely from --
yes ... you 're not a socialist then ?
no . i 'd want to --
then there 's the essential --
are you going to have coffee ?
yes , please .
and you 'll join me in a sambucca ?
freshman and sophomores ...
congratulations , and i really mean it .
thank you .
so , here 's to you and suez .
so it 's all worked out perfectly ...
it was very good .
we did n't actually speak .
can i give you a lift ?
what did you think of that wadja film ?
i was n't as enthusiastic as everyone else .
i thought it was tremendous .
i think it went on rather too long .
i could n't bear for it to end .
and i did n't like that man .
oh , but he was terrific .
it was sort of ... shapeless .
i have no aversions to what she does .
too bad . what did your father do ?
professionalism .
and you 're at this third stage
oh yes ?
how nice .
what about yours .
both dead .
damn . they 're early .
who ?
i called you a taxi .
very thoughtful .

why not stay ?
i have to be up early .

and fucked you .
you do n't trust me .
that 's what comes of working in television .
in radio we 're different .
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend .
did you get on with my mother ?
i think she liked me .
did she talk about me ?
i have n't really thought about it .
i have n't seen much of you .
i might .

i thought i was going faster .
and yet he gains .
and he 's got only himself .
-- people in masks can not be trusted .
catch up with us quickly .
what do i do ?
finish him , finish him . your way .
probably he means no harm .
he 's really very short on charm .
oh , you 've a great gift for rhyme .
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?
hello .
it 's you .
you do n't smell so good either .
perhaps not . i feel fine .
but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
how many could you handle ?
i do n't think more than ten .
let 's go --
-- where ?
to find the man in black , obviously .
-- fezzik , please --
come along , fezzik . bring the body .
the body ?
have you any money ?
inigo -- there 's more than thirty --
we 'll have to force feed him .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?

where did you get that ?
inigo .
what ?
please . fezzik !
i brought you a special present .

-- wait , just wait --
-- well , when does it get good ?
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered --
what ?
i 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous .
but that 's not the same thing .
because i can stop now if you want .
oh no . no , please .
do you want me to go on with this ?
yes .
westley 's only faking , right ?
you want me to read this or not ?
who gets humperdinck ?
i do n't understand .

-- sit down . all right ?
what ? what ?
you do n't want to hear it .

my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
it wo n't be easy , sire .
rise and report .
thirty men guard the castle gate .
i tell you once again -- surrender !
for the last time -- surrender !
but first things first . to the death .
let 's get on with it
they were both masters .
who won ? how did it end ?
the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !
shall we track them both ?
you returned this westley to his ship ?
yes .
your guess is as good as mine --
and it is guarded by sixty men .
and our assets ?
what i would n't give for a holocaust cloak .
now ?

i thought he was with you .
no .

do you always begin conversations this way ?
how old were you ?
you killed my father . prepare to die . ''
you 've done nothing but study swordplay ?
i hate to kill you .
i hate to die .
because i know something you do n't know .
and what is that ?
you 're amazing !
there 's something i ought to tell you .
tell me .
who are you ? !
no one of consequence .
i must know .

maybe i am the seeing-illusions type .
i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again .
of course we will .
where 'd you go to college ?
are going to get married !
watch your tenses .
huh ?
you going to wait here for me ?
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting ?
the one mary was in .
some way !
what makes you sound so certain ?
sorry .
hospital clean .
what ?
what is it ?
bates never denied mary was here .
you ca n't go up there .
why not ?
it 's regular . okay ?
sam !
nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .
i 've lost my girlish laughter .
the only girlish thing you have lost .
sam . this is the last time .
for what ?
i wish you would n't even come .
i 'm a working girl .
we 're a regular working-class tragedy !
you ca n't laugh at it , huh ?
can you ?
next best thing to no conscience at all .
i have to go , sam .
i can come down next week .
sam ! no !
and under any conditions . even respectability .
you make respectability sound ... disrespectful .
i 'm thinking of it .
how can you even think a thing like that !
do n't miss your plane .
dirty night .
you have a vacancy ?
they moved away the highway .
i thought i 'd gotten off the main ...
oh , just the town will do .
am i that close to fairvale ?
thank you , mr. bates .
you have something most girls never have .
i have ?
no .
i think that 's it .
i wish ... people could apologize for other people .
you 're very ... kind .
you eat like a bird .
you 'd know , of course .
curious , i mean .
uncommon , too .
i imagine so .
is your time so empty ?
you go out ... with friends ?
have you ?
only my share .
i do n't mean to pry ...
i 'm looking for a private island .
what are you running away from ?
why do you ask that ?
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .
i do n't mind it anymore .
but i could n't . she 's ill .
except you .
a son is a poor substitute for a lover .
why do n't you go away ?
to a private island , like you ?
no , not like me .
put her in someplace !
i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...
i meant ...
have n't you ?
thank you .
thank you , norman .
all the way back to phoenix .
i 'd like to , but ...
what time will you ...
very early . dawn .
alright , miss ...
crane .
that 's it .
in quite a hurry .
you slept here all night ?
i mean , just to be safe ...
no , m'am .

am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ?
frankly , yes .

it is n't necessary .
i 'll get your bags .

satisfied with your cabin ?
my mother is not dead !

... forty thousand dollars !
mother , please ...
you have the guts , boy ?
they thought she 'd be coming to me .
yes .
you sure you saw an old woman ?
you did n't find anything .
no mother .
did you notice the beaut that came in today ?
she must have run away from the morgue .
never mind your theories . was she ever conscious ?
just before she died she came to --
did you wish to see someone ?
you mean he does n't work for you ?
he 's inherited a fortune .
he never spoke to me of any rich relatives .
i believe it was his uncle in australia .
i know he 'll be pleased .
maxwell will be here around eight tonight .
so -- friendly or otherwise -- ?
we can travel or anything we choose .
no-
not taking their money .
you ca n't make me --
papers -- they all want me to sign papers .
they even brought a dog back to life once .
maybe you 're right .
thousands ?
in the fur business .
oh , i see . cats ' fur .
that 's it . you get it quick .
but where do the rats come in ?
how do you do .

he 's in the hospital . how about it ?
what 's that ?
take me down there .
those women have -- the gleam --
dr. meirschultz , please .
what are you going to do ?
you were going to put him under my power .
what is it ?
the wound is bleeding !
what is it now ?
i 'm losing my blood !
you 're losing your blood ?
yes !
what were you dreaming about ?
a voice ...
that spoke to you ?
that called ... commanded ...
your father ?
yes !

i 'd call it stupid at any time .
so that 's the way it is ?

we kept it ...
what did we steal ?
well i do n't !
besides , i 'm not ira no more .
so where do you go from here ?
larry from the states .
so what 's the deal ?
but it was n't my people who did it .
i never did trust that blonde fuck ...
is the rest of europe like this ?
food 's not our thing , you see .
budweiser for me , thanks .
it 's been known to happen .
not to me , you know that .
what in bloody hell is going on ?
from interpol ?
lose them !
about time !
good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?
do i need to repeat myself ?
sam . i 'm a weapons guy .
you were a soldier , were you ?
could you teach me to do that ?
you were pretty pissed .
i still am .
is that right ?
i better be getting that .
duty calls ?
now , what did we steal ?
oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ?
i 'm a patriate .
do n't even think that i 'm buying that .
i did n't say i was .
are you alright ?
who are you ? ira ?
it 's quite satifactory .
you sure about this ?
alright , gregor , i 'm ...
where 's the case ?
interesting . put down your weapon and walk away .
do n't do it , sam !
we 'll double your price .
really ? do you have the money with you ?
do you have the material ?
you first , edvard .
perhaps we could both go at the same time ...
do you have it ?
not so fast . who 's that ?
he 's company .
bad company ...
here 's yours .
there 's been a slight problem .
i take it you still want the money ...
where 's my information ?
sit , sit ... would you like one ?
and more importantly --
we 'll die if we stay here !
but you hate each other !
whoever hired us .
i do n't have it with me ...
bullshit !
i swear ...
then where is it ?
i sent it to myself in paris .
sent it where ?
is it done ?
gregor , is that you ?
so what do we do ?
a means to an end , is that it ?
that 's it .
then i guess we 're set .
there is one other thing ...
what are you doing ?
do n't cross me ...
nobody 's going to do that !
hello , jean-pierre .
he 's tough , your american friend .
yes , sam 's tough alright .
and you respect him .
he 's a cop ?
not exactly .
so he saved your life , then ?
enough to move on , for now .
you should really let a doctor look at that .
soon .
but first you have something to take care of ?
yeah .
something important ? a thing that can not wait ?
he sees this differently , as you well know .
vincent told you that i 'm a cop ?
so this is what , a test ?
created ?
and i 'm not any kind of samurai .
you shoot alright .
gets the job done .
your man might live .
not for long .
long enough to shoot back .
is that right ?
it 's been known to happen .
yeah , well ... my way works too .
i do n't understand .
what a surprise ...
they call me swede .
who 's they ?
you should watch what you eat .
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?
i ride with fat-boy ...
where is this broad ?
you should learn a little patience .
perhaps the police ?
cigarette ?
he trusts you to lock up ?
i 'm vincent . and i coordinate .
coordinate what ?
where to ?
to see a man about a thing .
pretty much what you 'd expect .
he says this is their block .
as in , they own it ?
i did n't know that you spoke french .
what 'd you say to him ?
judo ?
jujitsu .
same thing , is n't it ?
similar , but not the same .
what 's the difference ?
one cigarette a week , who smokes like that ?
it 's just so damned pleasurable .
a tough guy .
like larry or swede .
he 's smart , gregor is .
so is the woman .
smart , yeah , and seriously goddamned dangerous .
i wonder if she truly left the ira .
i wanted to see who you were .
somebody 's paying through the nose for this .
what 's going on ?
i just wanted to see something .
i hate cops ...
how did you know ?
know what ?
i came up here to sneak a smoke .
it was on the table .
it was at that .
a lot of people died .
i 've seen a lot of people die before .
how do you get used to it ?
he 's going back .
he might not even be in the country anymore .
that makes twice now you 've saved my life .
you need a doctor .
i 'll fix this myself if i have to .
not exactly .
you do n't have to do this .
alright , it 's done .
you see the bullet ?
clearly .
you know him ?
the irish representative ?
what 's this ?
just in case we need to find them .
it 's my job .
you do n't work for interpol , sam .
i do dark ops .
dark ops ?
dark operations . wet work . kidnaping . assassination .
very ugly .
it is at that .
not so much the modern samurai after all .
i never made that claim .
i know . jean-pierre did .
you were behind the door ?
you would have done that ?
how could you have done that ?
they do n't have the package .
you think ?
what the fuck happened ?
i do n't know ...
give me a cigarette .
right now ?
gim me a goddamn cigarette ! ! ! !
i 'm not here very much .
business keeps you on the road ?
so i do it .
in a minute .
do we need anything else ?
time to quit .
what of it ? samurai pain in the ass .
would you stop with that ...
because i do n't walk away .
do you really think they deserve it ?
that 's a good question .
do you have a good answer ?
you have to stop doing that !
let 's get him out of here ...
finish the job ...
and now ...
you son-of-a-bitch ...
what ?
you speak french .
what of it ?
i owe you a heavy debt .
i know .
you better get some sleep , alright ?
the package : what was it ?
what happened to it ?
gone . destroyed .
what 's the story ?
gaelic .

i was thirsty .
there 's a bathroom upstairs .
the water tastes better in the kitchen .
did you call that radio station again ?
no .
everyone at work heard you .
i just called for a second .
long enough to call victoria a ho .
it 's a short word .
it would really have hurt her feelings .
but nobody fits perfectly , everyone is an adjustment .
god , she 's beautiful .
who is annie ?
have you seen my wallet ?
are you going with her ?
you can marry count dracula .
what 's wrong with annie ?
mom never yelled at me .

no .
when i found you ?
if i did n't go .

over my dead body .
i do n't want you back in jail either .

`` deputy dewey oozed with inexperience . ''

you broke my heart .
what are we looking for ?
a ghost mask . something like that ?

hey ... dewey . can we go now ?
mom 's gon na kill you . then me .
you 'll ruin the whole night .
what is she doing here ?
did you reach my dad ?
you 're sure it was the hilton ?
at the airport .
could he have gone to another hotel ?
i do n't know . i guess .
any word on my dad ?
he did n't make those calls .
i 'm not making it up .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .
you girls ready .
have they found my father ?
afraid not .
should i be worried ?
it 's deputy riley today , sid .
we got him , sheriff . billy loomis .
hank loomis ' kid ? aw ... jesus ...
i was first to respond .
what were you doing out here ?
drive by patrol .
how is she ?
she 's tough .
neither of which keep purchase records .
what about the cellular phone bill ?
you think he did it ?
she staying with you ?
i want you to take look around .
dewey ! where the hell you been , boy ?
keeping my eye on sidney .
it 's confirmed .
could n't his cellular number have been cloned ?
it all fits . he 's our man .
have you contacted the bureau ?
you think he could still be in town ?
where 's sidney ?
should i bring her in ?
that fish smelled strong .
jesus ...
what is it ? where 's casey ?
where is she ?
call the police , goddamnit .
where is she ?
casey ! casey !

kenny , tell me i 'm dreaming .

i 'll look for it .
i 'm not here to fight .
just stay back .
i want to talk to you .
off the record . no cameras .
please . you owe me .
a book is not gon na change that .
you called me a liar .
i think you falsely identified him . yes .
have you talked to cotton ?
many times .
has his story changed ?
her blood was all over his coat .
i think she made it all up .
why would she lie about it ?
what if sidney killed casey and steve ?
she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy .
you 're evil .
she watched her mom get butchered .
where do you get this shit ?
i have no idea .
tatum 's on her way over .
it 's sexy .
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
you know i do n't watch that shit .
and why is that ?
are you alone in the house ?
you disappoint me , randy .
maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .
so who are you ?
the question is where am i ?
so where are you ?
why would you call me from my front porch ?
so where are you ?
can you see me right now ?
uh-huh .
hello ?
leavemealone !
looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .
are you okay ?
can you knock ?
i heard screaming .
no you did n't .
... out at the airport ...
... so call if you need me .
have a good trip .
stu was with me last night .
oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced .
where were you last night ?
working , thank you .
i thought blockbuster fired you .
stop . right there .
do n't shoot . it 's me .
do n't come any closer .
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .
for about two seconds .
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?
that i killed her or something ?
jesus , this place is packed .
we had a run in the mass murder section .
now that 's poor taste .
he did n't do anything .
he 's got killer printed all over his forehead .
the why 'd the police let him go ?
so what 's his reason ?
maybe sidney would n't have sex with him .
she 's saving herself for you .
how come they ca n't find his ass ?
and what would be your motive ?
i thought everything was checked out .
what 's leatherface doing here ?
he came to make up .
there goes my chance with sid .
when do we see jamie lee 's breasts ?
wan na another beer ?
yeah .
he 's gone psycho .
come on , sid . give me the gun .
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .
why are they doing this ?
tonight , my house .
are you serious ?
remember , there 's safety in numbers .
yeah , okay ... whatever .
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .
guess , i wo n't be needing this anymore .
why are you doing this ?
you 're crazy -- both of you .
the official term is `` psychotic '' .
what are you going to tell them ?
do you believe this shit ?
casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night .
no way .
she sits next to me in english .
her insides on the outside .
do they know who did it ?
teachers , students , staff , janitors ...
they think it 's school-related ?
or a man 's mentality .
my dad wo n't be back til sunday .
i 'll pick you up after practice .
tell your mom i said thanks .
i 'll be there by seven . i promise
thanks , tatum .
practice ran late . i 'm on my way .
it 's past seven .
whatever . just hurry .
she was supposed to pick me up .
just another sleepover at the riley 's .
just like old times , ai n't it ?
do you really think billy did it ?
he was there , tatum .
take a message .
come on , sid .
shit , what is he doing here ?
i bet he 's pissed .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
what do you think , sid ?
i do n't know ...
maybe he was having an affair with your mom .
so you think my mom was a slut too ?
that 's why it 's a rumor .
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers .
there 's been talk about other men .

d00-lang , doo-lang , d00-lang .

groom dogs . so ... nice loom .
keep tension on the warp . is that clear ?
just about . show me again .
and watch your heddles .
is this ... choir practice ?

we just need charts -- harmony -- chops .
chops ?
two days . an hour or so .
that machine .
i know . it 's ancient .
mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups ?
of course . spring is here the sun will shine
what is it , mary ?
jackpot ! two buckets
hurry , sister !
my soul was in danger i 'd fallen from grace
it 's true -- i know her .
damnation was all i could see
what a shame !
but then came an angel who whispered these words
pay attention ...
sing and the devil will flee !
frank . dean . sammy . right at ringside .
what ?
it sounds just like this place .
like this place ?
shirelles .
soprano or alto ?
mary clarence , are you with us ?
sure . kind of ... free-lance .
you and reverend mother .
what ?
i 'll try not to .
be a group .
four popes now . the lord hates a loafer .
they 're pretty raw .
wet behind the ears .
it 'll be hell .
hopeless i
amateurs 2
babies
she 's a pro .
look for a label .
van cartier .
why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?
just sing !
come on , we 're late .
what ? what time is it ?
it 's after five . we have to bathe .
two hundred hymnals . why ca n't people share ?
what ?
i ... i brought you something .
a cigarette ?
sister bruce ? sister doug ?
mary robert . i 'm ... mary robert .
st. k 's ?
three years . sister .
three years . a rookie .
a novice .

in a mature manner .
we must do this sacred thing , mary robert .
what is it ?
we must ... leave this place .
mary clarence !
bobs
experience ! right ?
so i can become a nun .
who are all these people ?
i 'm getting experience .
why do n't we ever see them in church ?
i 'd like to see him down front .
mary clarence !
goddamn it !
oh my lord !
i wish i had a ruler .
what ?
you whisper . nothing comes out .
i do n't want to mess anyone up ...
a sort of ... thank-you gift .
are you leaving us ?
what if i forget the words ?
who are you ?
run ! take off !
where are we going ?
mary clarence !
i was downhearted
do n't you know it !
but the lord came to me
what did he say ?
was n't there any more room in hell ?
what is your full name ? your christian name ?
and i 'm being punished !
your name ?
christy . christy van cartier .
enough joking .
currently i 'm a singer . sort of .
very well .
st. anne 's ?
parochial school . akron . st. android 's .
you were unhappy ?
i was expelled ! when i was fifteen ?
the reason ?
the demon bra .
i see .
you 're a nun !
sit down .
miss van cartier .
what ?
it has come to pass .
what ?
and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
are you talking about me ?
and all those like you .
you mean black people ?
the heedless . and their las vegas concubines .
what 's a concubine ?
capisce ?
and you 'll certainly want to change
`` guest of st. katherine 's ''
you will find appropriate attire .
the vow of poverty ...
no problem .
the vow of obedience .
and the vow of chastity .
silence ? no talking ? all day ?
a what ?
no food ?
is this all the food i get ?
yes . until breakfast .
this shall be your cell , mary clarence .
my what ?
the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?
we have little need for material possessions .
like a little color portable ? boom box ?
useless distractions .
the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
and whom would you call ?
oh , i do n't know ... satan ?
your cell is more than adequate .
ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?
it is nine p.m . pleasant dreams .
at nine ? my day 's just starting .
and its direction . or lack thereof .
what 's wrong with my life ?
yeah ?
do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?
i got it .
we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
you should help them !
sometimes it 's not enough !
how do you feel about physical labor ?
really catching on .
your behavior was inexcusable !
and i was the one they were shooting at !
to make a decent life for yourself .
excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
mary clarence , perhaps you are correct .
i am ?
no . no .
you 're my olympic event .
get some butts in those seats .
this is not a theater . or a casino .
pack the joint .
through blasphemy ? you have corrupted the entire choir !
we can wake this place up .
out of the question .
please let me try . i 'm begging you .
a vote ?
but ... wait a minute ...
you sent for me ?
in just a couple of days .
really . well , that makes two of us .
what ?
but -- why ?
you can be a part of it !
and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate .
you could keep it going .
good day , mary clarence .
but ...
what are you doing here ?
reverend mother -- thank-you .
oh ?
you saved my life .
life sentence . no parole .
a crank call to billy graham ?
we shall have a serious discussion .
sister show biz .
perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex .
what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .
at least he can afford a decent gift .
when we were seeing each other .
lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
so i do n't shop .
he 's a businessman .
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
what do you want -- cheap thrills ?
i ... i could n't believe it !
he owns a casino . he let me sing .
he did n't do you a favor .
and if i do n't ?
ten flights ?
all over the sidewalk . and into the street .
i 'll do it ! i 'll testify !
a five-star hotel . with room service .
okay -- no limo .
i hate you . i totally hate you .
everywhere . it 's crawling with 'em .
that 's all it 's gon na take .
they 'll be looking for me !
i 'll spring you as soon as i can .
eddie , what am i gon na do ?
get me outta her !
like what ?
i just need a few more weeks ,
what 'd she say ?
eddie ! you scared the hell out of me !
what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
it 's helping the convent .
you 're supposed to be hiding out !
sro . i 've got a show to do .
this is n't a career opportunity .
really good . and i taught them .
jesus , look at you you 're glowing .
i am ?
yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..
really ? lieutenant ?
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?
me too .
you 're not ... seeing anybody ?
and now ... you 've really changed .
i have ?
i 've got to go .
do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?
vince knows you 're here .
how ?
i ca n't go with you .
i 'm deserting them .
i think they 'd understand .
for what ? moral guidance ? make-up tips ?
they 've worked really hard , they deserve this .
what 're you doing ?
do n't you have a concert to go to ?
there 's only one way to be absolutely sure .
hey , girls .
hail , mary .
jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .
oh-huh .
they call me names . i mean , really .
really .
we could put you into our witness protection program .
then one day they find you .
dead or alive .
where 'd you stash her ?
where 's who ?
you wo n't even tell us ?
who are you guys ?
but you did n't tell me !
we did n't tell you what ?
a nun ?
vince -- is she ... okay ?
and if she runs ?
he 's so damn cocky . this is different .
it 's a bluff , vince .
it 's done ?
not ... totally .
well ?
right .
get her !
there she is !
i ca n't see anything in here !
joey ?
she 's like ... some kind of nun ?
she 's gettin ' away !
you did n't shoot !
you want us to fry ?
a sweater .
what 's she doing ?
it should be here any minute .
we sound terrible we need mary clarence .
she made us sing beautifully .
we 've got to save her !
sister mary patrick ?
yes ?
it 's marvelous , reverend mother .
she knew she was in danger .
in las vegas .
peace on earth .
however , we can also pray for other things .
is this like your old convent ?
that 's what reverend mother said .
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !
he 's not like other guys .
he 's decent .
i 'd rather sing than do anything !
it 's better than ice cream .
ice cream !
mary clarence ! sister !
what should we do ?
you mean -- they kidnapped her ?
an ... entertainer ?
we ca n't sing without her !
it 's so beautiful ...
the little sisters of the moonlight !
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ?
mary clarence -- you 're alive !
not a note .
she said they were from her old convent .
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere .
reverend mother ?
she is the underside of life .
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
but , bishop ...
to all in need .
i lied .
she seemed kind of upset .
it 's that call you were expecting , vince .
she 's a nun , vince .
i must have been out of my mind .
she 's ... she 's a nun .
where ?
who took the meat ?
hail , constable . how are you ?
i ... i did not ... no . why ?
how did you hear this ?
certainly not .
what the hell are you doing ?
ever shod a horse with a hoof this large ?
they spend two days in chains .
you must have missed your mark .
why did you move the body , doctor ?
no bleeding .
what is that ?
we must be a curious sight to him .
what are you spying on ?
he is a behemoth .
you were half-drowned when they found you .
... brom bones ...
bring young masbath here .
you need to sleep .
bring him .
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .
i will be in bed .
stains of blood .
no healing at all .
it is sacrilege !
i will not allow it . i will not !
protest to my superiors if you like .
a free thinker who does not believe in divinity .
an adulterer ...
i am the lord 's voice in this town .
wallowing in sin and lust ...
they need guidance .
wallowing quite literally in blood .
god damn you to hell !
taken back to hell .
may i see them , master hardenbrook ?
hmm ? see them ?
may we look at them now ?
maybe you should take this .
damn ... damn ... damn ...
perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?
it is possible this man was murdered .
have they nothing to fear presently ?
not for lack of trying .
will you do this for me ?
i shall , gladly .
i beg you , no more , please .
tell me something . what becomes of young masbath ?
the widow windsor .
is that all you say ? look at her .
we sent for the militia .
and the widow windsor was next ...
you do believe now , do n't you ?
what is that you wear ?
if i run in fear , it is worthless .
and , you dig up our dead .
listen to what you say ... .
i am here to bring justice .
i manage fine alone .
what is the common thread between these victims ?
i 'm sure i do n't know .
how could he ?
where are we going ?
what is it ?
out there . what do you see ?
the western woods .
are you familiar with magnets ?
what kind of nuts ?
it 's spectacular .
yes ... i suppose it is . keep it .
no , i could n't ...
thank you .
father said witches live there .
what is it ?
listen .
i hear nothing .
we are leaving .
we should not go much further in this murk .
should we go back ?
someone only tried to make it look that way .
true enough .
what is it ?
but , why this place ... ?
we should go .
man or woman ?
all i saw was their lantern .
i heard him say it .
it has gone intestate .
in test ... what ?
baltus van tassel .
did your father take a loan ?
my father 's loan papers are missing .
i was getting worried . who was it ?
lady van tassel .
what was she doing ?
did you find the victims ' loan agreements ?
this is as far as she could have gone .
it is absolutely nothing .
what books ?
what now ? where is she ?
sir ?
what can i say to convince you ?
why ... why are you like this ?
this is farewell .
there 's nothing left for me here .
climb up !
lady van tassel ...
what can we do ?
what now ?
how are you ?
forgive me , i did n't know .
you are horribly old-fashioned , are n't you ?
i 'll leave you to your business .
i ... have no great love of ...
other people ?
small talk .
my suitor ?
he has proposed to me twice .
sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life .
and , still others believe none of it .
there is no such thing as magic .
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions .
these scars . how did you get them ?
i can not remember what from .
the bird seems to be in his cage .
the point being ...
you made this , and the drawings ?
and yet , some would call this toy magic .
may i keep it at least ?
if you want . but ...
thank you . no . here ...
i insist that you have it .
but , it will only sit gathering dust .
people have put their trust in you .
they have done nothing of the sort .
why would you do such a thing ?
it may appear harsh ...
i did not imagine you were so cruel .
the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly .
must i hear this ?
and this gives worth to butchery ?
it was not butchery .
but , what do you want ?
to avenge his father , and the others .
i need to be alone .
i was wrong to say them .
every word you spoke had truth in it .
she bears so little resemblance .
what ?
she is not your birth mother , is she ?
no , but ... why do you ask that ?
is she still alive ?
what is this about ?
lord , how i hate this place .
do you want me to leave ?
it is only me .
katrina . why do you follow ?
blood .
what are you doing ?
the skull is gone .
what ... what are you doing ... ?
what is so urgent ?
and , what did he say ?
if you knew him , you would realize ...
what did he say , katrina ?
i have not been able to face him yet .
katrina ...
where are we going ?
the church .
what was that ?
ichabod ...
quickly , close it .
face front and wait for me .
i ... i ca n't do this .
returning to the western woods ?
yes , actually .
use caution .
no . she has gone out .
it appears well . it has already clotted .
do you have anything to clean it with ?
i know you saw me .
you can not kill what is already dead .
let her go !
can you show where the body lay ?
there was not much blood , was there ?
van ripper , turn the coach about !
what did you say ?
van ripper ... do you have a gun ?
are we intruding ?
you are from the hollow ?
i should tell you ... he has been murdered .
he rides to the hollow and back .
the horseman . yes .
can you help ?
what ... what are you doing ?
lay still , ichabod . do not move .
you ... you are alive .
he rides tonight .
a girl who had apparently become his secret love .
go home .
may i see my mother ?
go home to your father .
she did not do it ... please listen ...
she is guilty .
no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...
she has confessed .
get it ? that 's a goodun .
long time ago .
you do n't never go .
i 've tinkered around on 'em a little bit .

you have n't heard from rashid , have you ?
it 's beginning to get a little scary .
it could mean that he got away .
so what did he say when he called ?
where 'd you find it ?
we 'll be back in time for dinner .
hey , man , how 's it going ?
two , right ?
uh , better make it one .
somebody 's worried about my health .
they want to publish it on christmas day .
the paper of record .
you know anything about christmas stories ?
sure , i know a ton of 'em .
anything good ?
and i guarantee every word of it is true .
so . are we ready ?
ready . any time you are .
i 'm all ears .
are you following me so far ?
every word .
did you ever go back to see her ?
she probably died .
i never thought of it that way .
anything for art , eh , paul ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , it 's a good story .
i figured you were dead .
eighteen and a half years .
i thought it was about three hundred .
you 're looking good , auggie .
a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
i 'm all ears .
just between you and i .
auggie . it gives me the creeps .
like what ?
i might start screaming .
it 's for our daughter .
just think of it . our grandchild .
was that your idea to call her felicity ?
it means `` happiness . ''
why should i believe you now ?
what was i supposed to think ?
at least at first .
during one of those two seconds .
i ai n't responsible for no baby .
grease monkey these days ?
he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago .
i was n't born yesterday , you know .
she 's in real bad , auggie .
you caught me at the wrong time .
i 've got something to show you .
you do n't give up , do you ?
i just need you to come with me .
you what ?
besides , you might even learn something .
yeah , like what ?
it 's just that she 's not my daughter .
wait till you see her , auggie .
and what 's that supposed to mean ?
she looks just like you .
jesus christ . this is all i need .
still , you ca n't just write her off .
after she grows up .
i 'm flat out dead broke .
no you 're not .
i 'm flush .
bully for you .
what 's this ?
why do n't you open it and find out ?
there 's money in here .
five thousand bucks .
and you 're giving it to me ?
it 's all yours , baby .
for keeps ?
for keeps .
i ca n't stand people who blubber .
there 's just one thing i want to know .
just in case something goes wrong .
i could run this store in my sleep .
how long you been working for me , auggie ?
thirteen , fourteen years . something like that .
maybe because i love you so much , boss .
i almost got married once .
to that girl who moved to pittsburgh .
ruby mcnutt . my one true love .
you do n't take anything seriously , do you ?
the fuckers are going to kill me one day .
but do n't keep the boxes around here long .
i 've got it planned to the last detail .
see you in september , auggie .
seventeen .
one little whacked-out crazy fella ?
we 'll see what we can work out .
watch the register while i 'm gone , okay ?
a little . not much .
it 's for you .
open it .
what is this , some kind of joke ?
no , it 's five thousand dollars .
it 's probably stolen anyway .
it 's yours .
and why the hell would you give me money ?
so i can get my job back .
the whole thing . first name and last name .
how 'd you do out there , jimmy ?
good , auggie . real good . all finished .
it 'll never be finished .
huh ?
and when do i tell them it 's open ?
are you following me ?
does it hurt ?
what does it look like ?
and how much are these ?
the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties .
and these ?
fifty-six . that girl had on a corset .
and these ?
a real bargain .
i think i 'll take them .
the refrigerator ?
thanks for the tip .
what does that mean ?
is your name paul benjamin ?
what do you think ?
is that your game ?
i 'm looking for my nephew , thomas .
thomas ? who 's thomas ?
you ca n't fool me , mister .
i do n't know anyone named thomas .
thomas cole . thomas jefferson cole . my nephew .
you mean rashid ?
are you some kind of pervert , or what ?
do you hear me ? right now !
is that what he told you ? his parents ?
we live in boerum hill . in the projects .
he does n't go to the trinity school ?
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn .
i should n't have let him go .
i feel pretty stupid about it now .
a beer ? a glass of water ?
no thank you .
and you told your nephew about it ?
i figured he had a right to know .
and ?
jesus .
you going to sit here all day ?
i have n't decided yet .
i can stay here till kingdom come .
just passing through .
let 's see what you did , rembrandt .

what are you talking about ?
yeah ? and why is that ?
hey , jimmy . you got the time ?
huh ?
you still have that watch auggie gave you ?
tick-tock , tick-tock .
so what 's the time ?
you 'll get yourself killed like that .
i 'm walking around in a fog ...
i 've got to be going .
you saved my life .
the right place at the right time .
i owe you something .
it 's okay , mister . no big deal .
i would n't say no .
good . lemonade it is . i 'm paul .
that 's okay . i 've already had lunch .
it 's only eleven o'clock .
along with two bottles of champagne .
just one bottle . i believe in moderation .
well , maybe just one . to be polite .
what is it ? family problems ? money problems ?
oh no . momsie and popsie have oodles .

here and there . around .
yeah , that 's right .

i did n't expect to see you again .
you told me you were a mets fan .
the world is in your head , remember ?

yeah , i can believe it .
looking at yourself before you knew who you were .

i 'm cool , man .
take good care of yourself , okay ?
appreciation for what ?
i do n't know . for helping me out .
where did you get that thing ?
where the hell do you think you 're going ?
i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .
just cut it out and come back here .
i do n't have much time .
i want to hear all about it right now .
you do n't really want to know .
and ?
why do n't you go to the police ?
it looks like they 've met in this apartment .
we 're the outcasts of the universe .
let 's not get too idealistic .
thanks .
what time did you get to bed last night ?
two or three . it was pretty late .
besides , i 'm making up for lost time .
come on , just a little hint .
the inspiration .
no way .

happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?
i just did .
edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .

his only copy ?
would he ?
i do n't know .
is it yours ?
yeah , it might be .
yeah , i picked it up .
and started to run .
and started to run .
good thinking .
so how much does it come to ?
he just up and fired you ?
there was a reason .
well ?
i need facts , not opinions .
he never told me about it .
you ca n't be serious .
i 'm not going to do it .
i 'm finished with you .
eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city .
fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .
hi , kid .

how do you want that cooked ?
medium rare , please .
fries ?
yes , please .
lettuce and tomato ?
yes , please .
just curious , is all .
and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .
oh , yeh ?
you got no choice on that .
type b positive .
seeing that his type is o negative .
i do n't know .
i 'm a hemotologist , not a detective .
they make payments every june and december ...
why ? if they could never take title .
when you sent his family their equity .
what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ?
tried to . defaulted on their payments .
what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ?
is that your third question ?
it is .
now , mister gi ...
it 's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of .
so the fishing gaff method would n't make sense ?
so how would he signal for help ?
only a few hours later .
your husband returned at , what , seven o'clock ?
closer to eight .
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?
in case something went wrong .
everything was up in the air .
we discussed that . and decided not to .
so you hid the truth . deliberately .
to come forward seemed like a mistake .
question withdrawn , you may step down .
you 're implying th ...
necessarily .
to debate the wrongness of .
your dad would kill me with a machete .
my mom . would be the problem .
we have a few dol ...
people are a little crazy , right n ...

i just stood there , hating her .

did you find him eager ?
well , what then , sergeant ?
and it 's brand new . unlike the rest .
and the next one ... ?
not bowlined like miyamoto 's .
and the last ... ?
would those cleats have lined up ?
that 's your inference ?
a right-handed fella , to be precise .
looked exactly like this one .
could you tell me what 'kendo ' is ?
where carl went . over the side .
greedy .
at a tactic that insults their intelligence .
robbed . he was angry .
and who comes spetember 7 , wanting to buy ?
as my wife testified , we were considering it .
i know that now , and i regret it .
do you regret not telling the truth ?
i have told the truth .
that 's the truth .
you have the night watch ? on the radio .
how long you have this detail ?
out to cape flattery .
i did . boy .
you said three minutes .
you gon na climb that with one arm ?
but it 's not r ...
this tastes horrible , hmmn ?
your daddy . was quite a feller .
that 's what counts .
tell us why that lantern would be so significant .
that 's when he fell .
so he climbs up . to cut it down .
is n't that quite a coincidence ?
split-second tragedy happens every day . or maybe ...
and where 's the knife ?
still a coincidence . timing and all .
carl was a strong swimmer , he m ...

we do n't let go , you s ...
what for , sheriff ?
you always run with the well open ?
this one 's new .
naw , i had that around for a while .
where your hand goes .
what makes you think i play ?
you must think i like losing .
kendo , for one .
or honor or composure . or dignity .
and what 's that ?
like a soldier . like a samurai .
you want me to say that .
that 's sad . and it 's real .
and forgot the cup .
right . in the middle . of the floor .
cabin , mast , net lights , picking lights ...
yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .
did that strike you odd ?
so no , it did n't strike me odd .
does it now ?
a little . yes . you have to wonder .
correct ?
it is .
right there . why not use that ?
that 's the kind his well was fitted for .
no spare .
apparently .
i do n't think so .
< u > think < /u > so .
possible ?
she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking .
and her farmhouse ... ?
for a spare .
how does it get there ?
rather than the reverse , yes ?
or would both look the same .
is it possible ?
as much as 24 hours before death ?
did n't say no hope existed .
not in those words .
carl never lied .
defendant ever aim one of those at you ?
shall i repeat the ques ...
improved ... how ?
such as ?
church what about ... spirit ?
are these your bags ?
yes . and that one , too .
okay , doll .

oh - a member of the herring family .
champagne ?
i do n't mind if i do .
down the hatch - as we say at sea .

i had two ponies drowned under me .
where 's your shell collection ?
what 's on thursdays ?
it 's the crews ' night off .
you mean we 're alone on the boat ?
it 's just that i 'm - harmless .

nothing at all ?
complete washout .
that makes me feel just awful .
something goes wrong inside .
you mean you ca n't fall in love ?
how about a little cold pheasant ?
what happened ?
i do n't want to bore you .
oh , no !
talk about sad .
like my heart was shot full of novocaine .
what else is there for me ?
have you ever tried american girls ?
is that anything ?
maybe if you saw a good doctor ...
would you do me a favor ?
anything this time ?
i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
do n't fight it . relax .
it 's like smoking without inhaling .
well - ?
i never knew it could be like this .

we would have sooner or later .
how do you get this thing down ?
he 's dead sheila .
i feel sick .

are you sure he 's dead ?
he gets into his car .
you do n't get two chances with junior .

he moves up beside her again .
you 're really pissing me off .

very professional .
i am a professional man .
lips still for sale ?
lane 's closed big fellah , league night .

i can feel the heat on my legs .
fletcher , get away from there ...
it 's burning ...
get out of there !
i ca n't see ...
fletcher ! now !
in basic english , what does all this mean ?
there 's heat coming the door .
back away then .
wait a minute --
i said back away .
hold on --
even on earth . take ... yeasts .
norman !
after the storm clears .
they told me about sixty hours .
nobody move .
but she 's --
i 've never seen anything like it .
nice work , captain sir .
direction 's east coming !
target acquired . sixty yards .
what if it attacks ?
fifty yards and closing .
what do we use for defense ?
the only defense we have is high voltage .
high voltage ?
but we 've never used it underwater before .
forty yards .
but you 've tested it ?
each time it started fires inside the habitat .
where is it ?
what was that ?
increase positive pressure !
that 's our reserve air .
do n't do it , norman !
this thing is gon na crush us .
do n't do it !
norman , please ! do n't !
thank you , colonel .
captain .
the pentagon made me take you .
come with me . the team 's already waiting .
what have you been told so far ?
plane crash . survivers unknown . routine stuff really .
anything else ?
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?
we 're moving fast considering the storm .
storm ? what storm ?
how deep is he ?
a thousand feet .
survivors ? no , i would n't think so .
then why am i here ?
what ?
a military spacecraft ? like a shuttle or satellite ?
something like that . that does n't surprise you ?
-- wait a second --
-- dating the crash at least that old .
hold on --
extraordinary , is n't it ?
it does n't make any sense .
what team ?
they pressurize us with helium .
what 's wrong with oxygen ?
what is it , norman ?
picked up something ? what is it ?
maybe we should n't .
i do n't know . that 's the point .
do n't get hysterical , norman .
harry 's missing .
what do you mean , he 's missing ?
he 's gone . he left .
but sir --
i know beth . she can be drastic .
how drastic ?
you do n't want to know .
when was this ?
i thought you should know .
wait a second --
it 's like `` see spot run . ''
great , okay . ask him about his weapons .
let 's talk about guns and violence .
you do n't think weapons are important ?
edmunds ?
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...
i do n't want you talking to jerry .
you think he killed edmunds ?
it 's an animal .
going active .
what the hell ? it shut us down .
jerry ? please . stop this .
yes , sir . i 'm here .
i see it .
can you open that panel ?
it 's not sucking , sir .
what caused it ?
i thought i told you people --
subs are still at surface , sir .
i 'm getting no sub reading , sir .
any sign of harry ?
nothing , sir .
nothing , sir .
yes , sir .
well , where the fuck is he ?
they 've left , keep watching !
norman , get out of there now ! norman ?
i need you for this .
how much damage ?
to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
it 's chipped .
i did .
ted ? captain ?
yes , harry .
where it 's been .
they have another purpose entirely .
so how do we get it open ?
the anthropomorphic problem . good , norman .
so ? what 's the problem ?
gim me a report , i want --
ladies and gentlemen ...
who is that ? where 's that coming from ?
what 's the message ?
i have to tell you . it 's strange .
ignorant . the thing 's ignorant .
where 's edmunds ?
he wants to know who 's in charge .
harold with an `` o '' .
she 's not gon na know .
i 'd also like it noted --
ted , get her away from the door .
look at this .
some sort of lead or something .
radiation shield , you think ?
what 's wrong ?
we had considered it .
i am . after what we just witnessed .
did you hear me , sir , because --
how can he be missing ?
they switched us over .
to what ?
you know , i never knew that .
from the sphere ?
it 's not talking , it 's mimicking .
what is that ?
the sensors are picking up something outside .
it 's too big to image .
what was edmunds doing outside ?
resetting the sub .
what sub ?
it 's brilliant .
it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .
because when we get down there --
wait -- down where ?
to the spacecraft . to investigate .
underwater ?
for them to bring it up here ?
that 's first grade geography .
have you said anything to barnes about this ?
the timing has never seemed quite right .
do n't jeopardize this .
you 're next , norman .
no . go ahead . really . ladies first .
norman !
where 'd this come from ?
the library .
we have a library ?
norman , come here , look at this .
killed him .
my gosh , norman .
yeah , it was awful .
what about you ? what happened to you ?
then jellyfish ?
what do you mean -- not normal ?
and the squid too . they had no stomach .
wait a minute .
what ?
before fletcher went out there ?
yeah , why ?
what ? why ...
beth --
i was n't absolutely sure if ... they --
which is it ?
wait . do n't ... why are you --
beth .
why are you looking at me like that ?
i did n't mean ...
she 's like a sponge .
feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper .
norman .
what are they ?
he left us down here .
nobody .
do n't get worked up --
signed , barnes , usn . ''
where did you get this ?
in edmunds ' things .
calm down , beth . alright ?
do n't tell me to calm down !
you said something to him , did n't you ?
what ?
beth --
you did , did n't you ?
do n't do this .
you bastard .
yeah , okay . sure , norman .
beth --
where are you going in such a hurry ?
forget the sub .
do n't bother me , norman .
it 's not worth the risk .
and there 's only three of us left now .
you , me and harry ?
you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
let 's go . get outta --
four days ?
maybe you should go . to the sub .
why should i go ?
just in case .
in case you die , too ?
i do n't trust harry to do it .
i would . but my suit --
you fixed my suit ?
you do n't trust me ?
but i do n't know how --
you see it ?
how does it look ? still clear ?
what 's the matter ?
you fixed this suit ? beth ?
i did . you 're just nervous .
my air is n't ... i 'm coming back .
still clear ?
i 'm in the ship .
what are you doing in the ship ? beth ?
harry said he 'd take over for me .
you get it straightened out ?
what 's harry doing with your suit in there ?
fixing it .
the refridgerator .
that was n't in there before .
we must 've had it delivered then .
wait a second --
1-800-deepsea delivery . i hear they 're good .
none of this was here before .
it was on the top shelf .
earlier . he must 've hid it .
you think ?
you do n't believe me .
all i know is i opened that refridgerator --
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
i was n't there .
page 87 .
what ?
some skeletons of squids ...
manifested ?
he translated it wrong .
what do you mean , a part of harry ?
after harry came out of the sphere .
you think , in the sphere --
a power to manifest things .
but how ?
i do n't know .
how can the sphere do that ?
which i told barnes was attacking --
he 's manifesting his fears . making them real .
but why is he doing it ?
he must 've manifested his dream .
looks like some sort of code .
diphenyl parlene .
something for burns .
it 's for motion sickness .
valdomet .
ulcers .
sintag .
a synthetic opium analogue .
to get him unconscious -- put him under .
nothing about drowsiness .
tarazine ?
tranquilizer . causes drowsiness .
bingo .
riordan ?
antihistamine . for bites .
damn it ! chloramphenicol ?
antibiotic .
parasolutrine ?
how do you spell it ?
p-a-r-a-s-o ...
it 's a soporific .
what 's that ?
causes sleep .
how long does it last ?
three to six hours .
i 'll just boost the doses .
what ? wait -- is n't that dangerous ?
how fast does it take effect ?
does n't say .
it 's an idea .
beth --
to be on the safe side . i mean --
you ever given an injection before .
in residency . i passed out . you ?
i 'm sorry .
for what ?
not believing you .
what is it , norman ?
where are you ?
the sphere looks different .
what do you mean , different ?
what was that ? i could n't hear you .
your watch .
what 's wrong , norman ?
i 'm feeling better .
it 's getting cold .
how do you feel about snakes ?
snakes ? what do you mean , exactly ?
you know what i mean .
this is quite good .
in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .
you tell me .
do you fear them ?
do n't you ?
why did you go in the sphere , beth ?
for the power . to protect myself .
harry 's unconscious . he 's not a threat .
no , he is n't .
he ca n't manifest .
no , he ca n't .
why put out explosives ? why manifest the snakes ?
you think i manifested the snakes ?
someone did .
beth you 're losing it . c'mon .
c'mon -- what ?
you 're lying --
they 're your fear , are n't they ?
but --
that 's when you went in the sphere .
one lonely , terrifying sea snake .
you manifested that , beth .
you did that , norman .
you 're insane .
i never went in that sphere .
you remember that .
that 's bullshit .
is it ?
my name is n't harry .
you feel okay , do n't you ?
i swear . it ca n't be .
do n't , beth .
but i have to , norman .
i promise --
promise what , norman ? tell me !
beth --
not yours . not his . mine .
do n't , beth . please .
to be thinking about things .
it 's not safe for you to be either .
this vindictiveness . this rage .
because you hate beth .
do n't fuck with me , beth .
beth !
where is it coming from , beth ?
beth , stop it !
then where 's it coming from ?
stop it !
beth ?
you ca n't fight me .
i know . you 're too strong , beth .
not now .
i --
i already know too much .
beth -- gim me the gun .
let beth check the fridge .
c'mon --
top shelf , is it ?
what is that ? what are you doing ?
what ?
you hear that ?
hear what ?
get away from me !
beth --
would it work ?
and i think we already know it will .
pussy .
no . i do n't think so .
because there 's footprints here that are n't mine .
i do n't get it .
well , what 's your theory ?
norman ? where 's norman ?
he does n't wait for an answer .
what are we -- neanderthals ?
we should think about making a good first impression .
for who ? the fish ?
why would someone build a ship like this ?
then what is it ?
what are you looking for ?
he told me to get some from the ship .
i never said that .
you know that .
we never even had a conversation , norman .
just in time , too .
in time for what ?
what ?
this place ca n't handle another attack .
why are you looking at me like that ?
like what ? i 'm not --
you 're staring at me .
no i 'm not . i 'm not star --
we can refuse to talk .
when did it come across ?
where 's it coming from ?
it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater .
how are you feeling , norman ?
what ?
you holding up alright ?
fine . i 'm fine .
do n't be defensive .
i 'm not being defensive .
you sound defensive .
go ahead . ladies first .
c'mon .
c'mon , norman .
nice work , norman .
our answer .
to what ?
this answers one of our questions .
which one ? let me get the list out .
do n't be so optomistic , harry .
you know what that is ?
i ca n't believe that , harry .
you mean , you think i 'm cracking ?
no . i did n't say that .
what is that ? that noise ?
what noise ?
harry , can you tell me about the sphere ?
what are you still doing here ?
you remember opening the door ?
you were n't supposed to stay down here .
harry ?
you do n't understand about the sphere .
norman ?
what is it , harry ?
have you ever read page 87 ?
page 87 of what , harry ?
i never wanted to .
you might have a second career coming .
getting anywhere with those ?
it 'll take a minute .
harry , what happened in the cafeteria ?
did i ?
you do n't remember that ?
... you there ? norman ?
harry ?
norman , where are you ?
i ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear ?
my suit -- beth said she fixed it --
what happened to her ?
what do you mean ? she 's not here ?
her suit 's gone .
beth left ?
she 's cracking , norman .
take a look for yourself .
but why would she -- ?
wisconsin 's your answer .
wisconsin ?
navy transmission . they 're sent from wisconsin .
how do we decode it ?
the three of us .
what is it ?
it 's the squid ! stop it !
did i kill her ?
i do n't think so .
fine .
we 're never gon na make it .
once we 're in the sub .
i ca n't reach her .
push her , c'mon .
missed .
hold on .
hurry , norman . four minutes .
three fifty-six , three fifty-five , three --
c'mon , norman !
i 'm trying to keep balance with --
her legs are in the way .
harry ?
you know how to work this thing ?
no idea .
well , press something !
nine hundred feet to surface .
how 's that working out , by the way ?
you do n't even know what that means .
there is one possibility .
what if we feared the power to go away ?
you mean forget ?
what 'd you say to him ?
nothing . nothing that norman does n't already know .
what does norman already know ?
she told me what you said , norman .
what is it , harry ?
easy ted , we 're not mining gold .
english ?
i think it 's rather obvious .
try again .
but it 's impossible .
why would this ship carry instructions in english ?
i think i 've got it .
do you ?
if it is an alien spacecraft --
not even a scratch .
meaning ?
meaning it did n't land in the water .
please . it must have flown here --
it < u > arrived < /u > here .
arrived ? from where ?
we 're not a bunch of icy streets here .
helps you from getting impotent .
well , if it 's a discharge --
i 'll work on it .
what 'd you say ?
good idea , ted .
norman johnson .
the ships ?
how are the others ?
the others , sir ?
beth and harry ?
what was that , sir ?
any other bags , dr. johnson ?
no other equipment ? scientific instruments ?
no , they did n't say --
captain who ?
i think it 's brilliant .
what report ?
you mean they have n't told you yet ?
i treat aircrash survivors .
oh , so you 're that dr. johnson .
what report ?
huh ?
what report ?
you mean you do n't know ?
who 's everyone ?
physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it .
geologists ? at a plane crash ?
he was n't feeling well .
he 's overlooking things . obvious things .
you mean a picture ?
go ahead . squint at it .
i do n't see anything .
squint harder .
please , ted .
try this one .
this is like nursery school .
it 's a picture of the creature .
the creature ?
well , he 's polite .
what was it ?
could n't get a reading .
has harry spoken with jerry ?
with what 's out there ?
he said earlier -- we were his friends --
what kind of a crash was it ?
you seen my suitcase ?
did he say what airline ?
he did n't say much at all . honey --
are you watching the news ?
there 's a u.s. navy car outside , norman .
what ?
was it a military crash ?
i do n't know .
who 's in charge then ?
well , we 'll see ...
the empire must have gotten here first .
i 'd know about it .
we have n't much time .
how much do you think she 's talking about ?
fear is their greatest weapon .
you 've done very well .
i do n't like it .
i can feel the kiber crystal .
good morning !
i 'm luke starkiller , guardian of the bendu .
oh , so you 're a warrior then ?
i do n't believe we 've ever met .
i 'm not that important .
i 'm not even a startrooper .
i know that .
you saw through me ?
you could put it that way .
i assure you my intentions were n't bad .
now what brings you out here ?
i 'd never make it .
this is your responsibility !
you mean i generate an energy field ?
what do you mean ?
that 's where my father was killed .
that 's how they 've become so powerful .
do the sith know the ways of the force ?
they use the bogan force .
i thought that was just a saying .
the bogan force is the most heavy there .
how can they hold her ?
are you all right ?
are you sure you do n't need it ?
it 's the only thing you can rely on .
what is it ?
i ca n't see ! how can i fight ?
try to feel it . use the force ...
i 'll get hit .
what about the princess ?
i must try to find the crystal .
the kiber crystal .
of course , where you been kid ?
they 're just sitting there !
i ca n't wait until my hitch is up .
you 're starkiller ?
yes , sir .
have you been checked out ?
this is no joy ride we 're going on .
blue five , does that glare bother you ?
i 'm right behind you , blue leader .
do you copy , luke ?
yes , sir , but i can get him ...
should we alert the sith lords ?
it 's not under power .
let 's take a look at it .
this has turned into a brilliant escape !
here come six more ... grid two !
where are you taking us now anyway ?
i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .
this terrain is hopeless .
we have little time before the death star arrives .
who 's the pilot ?
you do n't believe in the force ?
i found it ... it 's just not there .
we must find them ...
they probably do n't think anyone would dare try .
this is n't going to work .
why did n't you say so before .
let 's try this way ...
let 's try this way ! holy maker .
i think she 's going to be all right .
watch it ! move back .
fire above him !
get to the ship !
she 'd better be right .
i thought i 'd help .
we 'll send a squad up .
no need , everything 's under control .
with four casualties ? !
give us a few minutes to get it fixed .
what 's going on ? where are we ?
i am luke starkiller at your service .
are there medical facilities on yavin ?
and you ?
if my father were here ...
you can call me luke .
were you in many battles ?
i 'm done for .
blast it !
perhaps they might bring something .
see threepio ... do you copy ?
i read you sir .
we 've had some problems .
are you safe ?
artoo is trying to plug into the system now .
holy maker , threepio . i forgot ...
are you there , sir ? we 're going ...
i guess you and me could be buddies .

your father will never let you .
so what do you think your chances are ?
i do n't believe it !

so what are you doing later ?

if we go out together we 're all dead !
atkins what makes you so sure ?
because i 'll be firing at them .
well filmore --
i have a lighter !

enjoying the tour so far ?
are you going to kill us ?

i do n't want any ...
i insist ...
she 's still alive .

we 've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions .
what about cooper -- where is he ?
she 's as good as gone ...
who 's ryan cooper ?
and what exactly do they intend to do ?
so , what are we looking at white ?
we have to be ready for any contingency --
we were under government contract !

!
that 's nonsense , and you know it !
goodbye , mister ambassador .

i caught you red-handed , mister ambassador .
give that back to me .
why should they ?
?
here is the only other camera i have left .
my seven body orifices ? ? ? ?
although it could be riki-tiki-tavi .
what are you talking about , major ?
get a grip on yourself , major !
do you have any witnesses , major ?
what ?
boys , wo n't we , major ?
did n't they tell you ?
the general had us disconnect ...
maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .
that 's it ! the president ! ! !
so what ?
there 's bound to be enough change in there .
what is your name , young lady ?
ceida pietraszkiewicz .
what did you say ?
yes !
general schmuck ?
go back to sleep , baby .
no , sir .
well , mister president .
general schmuck ?

that 's a very wise deduction , general .
combat operations center , major mandrake speaking .
this is general ripper speaking .
yes , sir .
do you recognize my voice ?
why do you think i ask ?
good . has the wing confirmed holding at x-points ?
yes , sir .
i 'm putting the base on condition red .
condition red !
i want this flashed to all section immediately .
it looks like we 're in a shooting war !
a shooting war !
this looks like it 's going to be it .
have they hit any of our cities yet ?
and i mean tight .
you 're right , sir .
no calls .
nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so .
my voice can be imitated too , major .
who do you think you 're talking to ?
but how do i know ?
are you trying to be insubordinate ?
no , sir .
plan-r ? ? ? ?
are you hard of hearing , major ?
are you questioning my orders , major ?
general , can i ask a question ?
i suppose they are , sir .
you 're damned right they are .
how much soda , sir .
that about right ?
what shall we drink to , sir ?
general ripper , can i ask another question ?
do n't think i have n't .
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war ?
do you follow me , major ?
i guess so .
where , sir ?
do n't they say they want disarmament ?
are they a peace-loving country , major .
what if they start something ?
do n't you see ?
major , you 're talking like one of them !
honestly , sir .
do you think we 'd cheat ?
i 'm sure we would n't .
do you think they would cheat ?
major , those are my boys out there dying .
to peace on earth , major .
it was a honest mistake , sir .
i presume the planes are armed ?
the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ?
general jack d. ripper , sir .
i want to talk to general ripper .
we do n't operate like you kgb boys .
have you received acknowledgements from every plane ?
they 're coming in now .
how long will it take to receive them all ?
how many planes did we lose ?
general schmuck , are you positive of your figures ?
naturally i am , sir .
have you tried the recall again ?
what 's the target .
i 've got the heading , major . one-three-eight .
roger , maintain .
can you see bromdingna island yet ?
i 'm taking her down to the deck .
what else could it be ?
we would n't have started it .
they must have clobbered some of our cities already !
maximum ecm .
then this is it .
what ?
war .
i guess i was way out of line .
a through h is correct .
fight interference on readi- ness state .
check .
steady track , they look like beam riders .
twelve o ' clock .
speed ?
between mach 3 and 4 .
call them every five miles .
twenty ! twelve o ' clock .
yeah , i got it in the thigh .
roger .
fighters closing fast - range fifty miles .
they must have made a visual contact .
must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .
they ca n't touch us at this height .
i think they mean business .
my leg 's stiff as a board .
you got it ?
roger , i 'm setting up the crm-114 .
primary arming switch .
so am i .
listen , i think i 'm hit bad .
where 'd they get you ?
what does it look like ?
some kind of signaling .
on behalf -- -
any questions ?
i 've got one .
we 'll just be hitting empty real estate .
are you saying our order do n't make sense ?
primary circuit is live .
release first safety .
second safety .
fusing for ten thousand air burst .
master safety .
primary bomb is live .
master safety on now until bomb run .
everything still checks out okay .
i 'm hit kinda bad , i think .
ca n't `` ace '' help you ?
he 's dead .
what happened ?
?
where 'd they get you ?
how do you know he 's dead ?
he 's dead , all right .
it 's `` ope - recall mistake . ''
you sure have to hand it to those guys .
what do you mean ?
i mean pulling a stunt like that .
where would they get that ?
you tell me .
no one else would know it .
why should they call us back ?
then that settles it , does n't it ?
like hell it does .
the crm-114 is smashed , right ?
right . so how could we get any messages ?
that 's the point .
i do n't get you , king .
?

sorry , king .

it 's me - lothar . are you okay ?
but i do n't get a green light .

i had a teacher like that once .
now why do n't you use that character ...
who wants true ? who wants moving ?
here 's some- thing really worth while .
maybe there 's some paper around .
i 've got a few ideas .
how about living it up a little ?
as for instance ?
or should we just turn on the shower ?
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ?
are you hungry ?
furthermore , you can have the phone now .
i find i 'm terribly afraid of losing you .
you 'll be waiting for me ?
with a wildly beating heart .
i 've got the most wonderful news for you .
not lately .
they never heard of you .
is that so ? what 's the wonderful news ?
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher .
what teacher ?
i got him all hopped up about it .
you did ?
he thinks it could be made into something .
into what ? a lampshade ?
o.k . where 's the cash ?
it needs work .
i was afraid of that .
i tell you this is half sold .
i want to write .
sorry if i crossed you up .
you sure have .
it 's all yours .
help yourself .
what about all those ideas you had ?
i 'll make it short .
sorry . it 's your baby now .
we 'll have to do it together .
i 'm all tied up . i ca n't .
artie is out of town .

honest to goodness , i hate you .
because i think it 's good .
so do i .
good .
i miss him something fierce .
it 'll play .
it will ?
do n't you sometimes hate yourself ?
who 's norma ?
who 's who ?
i do n't usually read private cigarette cases .
a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous .
i 'll say . this is solid gold .
what were you -- a child actress ?
mother still works in wardrobe .
second generation , huh ?
nice job .
should be . it cost three hundred dollars .
saddest thing i ever heard .
now i 'm a reader ...
it 's really more fun .
i will now kiss that nose of yours .
may i say you smell real special .
it must be my new shampoo .
how old are you anyway ?
why are you staring at me like that ?
was i ? i 'm sorry .
what is it , betty ?
i do n't want to talk about it .
why not ?
i just do n't .
let 's face it , what- ever it is .
i got a telegram from artie .
from artie . what 's wrong ?
it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
that 's what you 've always wanted .
i do n't want it now .
why not ? do n't you love artie ?
what happened ?
is it something awful ?
valentino used to dance here .
this is where you live ?

if you love me , joe .
hello , young fellow .

i 'm pretty busy , as you can see ...
you read the script , did n't you ?
what assistant ?
do n't play innocent . somebody named gordon cole .
did you see how they came ?
we 'll see what we can do .
what 's the matter , norma ?
i had no idea how i 'd missed it .
it 's a good script , is n't it ?
of course , it would be an expensive picture ...
i would n't know .
i thought this was an empty house .
get out .
or shall i call my servant ?
you used to be big .
it 's the pictures that got small .
i knew there was something wrong with them .
i 'm just a writer .
ssh ! you 'll wake up that monkey .
just a minute , you !
yeah ?
you 're a writer , you said .
and you have written pictures , have n't you ?
i ought to have it taken out .
i have written it myself . took me years .
looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures .
i think i 'll have demille direct it .
we 've made a lot of pictures together .
and you 'll play salome ?
who else ?
i did't know you were planning a comeback .
fair enough .
they 'll love it in pomona .
read the scene just before she has him killed !
he may steal it .
well ?
this is fascinating .
i wrote that with my heart .
what it needs is a little more dialogue .
i will not have it butchered .
just an editing job . you can find somebody .
i do n't know .
what month ?
december twenty-first .
i like sagittarians . you can trust them .
thank you .
i want you to do this work .

where do you live ?
there sure is .
you can stay here .
i 'll take care of that .
it 's all paid for .

i did n't say i was staying .
what 's that ?
just a scene i cut out .
what scene ?
cut away from me ?
they do n't want that any more .
norma desmond .
i want to talk to you for a minute .
i 'm playing three no trump .
they 've come for my car .
now i 've forgotten how many spades are out .
i need some money right now .
now what is it ? where 's the fire ?
that 's a dreadful shirt you 're wearing .
how about some evening clothes ?
i do n't need a tuxedo .
of course you do . a tuxedo and tails .
tails . that 's ridiculous .
all padding . do n't let it fool you .
should n't we wait for the others ?
not on the same floor with valentino !
do n't bend back like that .
what time are they supposed to get here ?
who ?
the other guests ?
you think this is all very funny .
what 's that ?
what are the notes ?
`` mad about the boy . ''
you 've bought me enough .
i 've got a million dollars .

some car hop , or a dress extra ?
did she read the script ?
demille always said i was his greatest star .
when did he say it , norma ?

i 'll get you some .
it took you hours .
i ran into some people i knew .
where are my cigarettes ?
why are you so glum ?

his greatest successes .
maybe demille is shooting .
do n't you want to come along , darling ?
it 's your show . good luck .
how did it go ?
he must be quite a guy .
keep your eyes on the book .
good night .
i 've lost half a pound since tuesday .
this woman has done wonders with it .
good .
you 'd better get to bed yourself .
why do you say that ?
you were n't here . where were you ?
i went for a walk .
no you did n't . you took the car .
i have n't done anything , norma .
you 're not leaving me ?
yes , i am , norma .
no , you 're not . max ! max !
what is it you want -- money ?
that 's between you and yourself , norma .
sure -- if it would make a good scene .
but hundreds of thousands of people will carel
that 's a lie ! they still want me !
no , they do n't .
what about the studio ? what about de mille ?
the studio wanted to rent your car .
none of us has had the heart .
i get letters every day !
you heard him . i 'm a star !
i 'm the greatest star of them all .
goodbye . norma .
i had a blow-out . i thought --
look , maybe i 'd better take my car --
you are not dressed properly .
suppose you listen just for a minute -
madame is waiting .
i made your bed this afternoon .
i put in soap and a toothbrush .

is there anything missing ?
some men are here . they asked for you .
i 'm not here .
that 's what i told them .
good .
whose room was this ?
there is n't any lock .
how come ?
the doctor suggested it .
what doctor ?
there have been some suicide attempts .
uh-huh ?
we shut off the gas in her bed- room .
she still gets those fan letters .
i would n't look too closely at the postmarks .
you send them . is that it , max ?
i suppose all the waxworks are coming ?
how is she ?
mr. gillis , if you please .
that did n't leave much for wallace reid .
it is the car they want to rent .
i can not let her be destroyed .
you made her a star ?
demille , and max von mayerling .
joseph c. gillis ?
we 've come for the car .
relax , fans . the car is n't here .
is that so ?
got a title ?
you 'd have turned down gone with the wind .
do you see it as a betty hutton ?
frankly , no .
sure , gillis . if something should come along -
along is no good . i need it now .
have n't got a thing .
any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .
now if dewey had been elected -
only i 'm not going to .

for the right moment .
i do n't know her name .
i think i 'd better keep it .
whatever you say .

what do you want ?
you know how she loves to ski .

it 's a warning , that 's for sure .

we could be very happy here .
from her .
she said it would n't last .
i do n't love you any more .

i 'm not sure .
goodnight , mr. ansel .
billy , please . the children .

this is never going to go away ...
you know how much we need the money .

... or that the guardrail was n't strong enough .
you believe that ?
i have to .
why ?
because i have to .
that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ?
yes .
why did you do that , billy ?
no one calls me 'mrs . driscoll ' .
what do you mean by that , dolores ?
about the ottos ?
their hair and clothing ...
do they have any reputation for drugs ?
and they loved bear .
abbott and me were judges at the pet show .
it comforted him .
from what ?
financial pressures ... run-ins with the law ...
it was obvious how much he missed lydia .
you talked about it ?
that 's the way i thought of them sometimes .
berries .
berry-picking .
yes . the old-fashioned way .
and what 's that ?
were his parents ... attentive to him ?
what do you mean ?
you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
that 's right .
did his parents attend to that ?
what do you mean ?
did they give him special care ?
i have a question for you , mr. stephens .
that would complicate things .
he knows that ? billy ?
yes . he does .
you 've talked to billy ?
what other people ?
you heard what abbott said ?
yes .
that 's what he said , is it ?
he looked frightened .

no .
why not ?
i was scared . and there was n't time .

we 're trying to work with you .
i think you should call it off .
the mayor 's car is pulling up .
i 'll go down and speak to him .
only pendergast can pull the plug .
it 's been over three hours --
sweet jesus !

i 've read about the museum 's financial troubles .
i 've arranged for a large police presence .

i enjoy the smell of a good cigar .
lieutenant --
twelve bodies on board .
out of brazil , was n't it ?
so the method of death is the only connection ?
you 're kidding .
nice touch .
i can still hear the mother screaming --
i 've learned a few things .
how big is the sub-basement ?
apparently it 's huge .
i think i should come with you .
pendergast ! help ! it 's right behind us !
the sub-basement ?
i smell it . it 's here .
run !
nice to see you , lieutenant .
look . it 's some kind of letter .
my god . he says that mbwun is real !
should n't a drug that powerful be destroyed ?
lieutenant ! it 's me .
what is it ?
dr. green has to see you !
got my hands full here .
what happened ? !
it 's still back there !
all right . kawakita , cover the rear .
what 's that ?
what does it say ?
dr. john whittlesley .
what 's that doing here ?
dear god . where are we , lieutenant ?
we 've met . the hacksaw murders . '89 .
i hope you liked it .
curious . there 's something missing .
the thalamus and the hypothalamus , perhaps ?
i do n't believe it .
i 've overstayed the party a bit .
you 're practically an institution around here .
please . do n't humiliate me further .
i can take care of everything .
the fact is , i want to retire .
you know it 's not true .
you 've left me in the dust .
i 'll walk you back to the elevator .
i 'm not giving up .
i 'll garden . i 'll write .
it wo n't be the same without you .
a plant press . pretty unimpressive stuff .
what is it ?
john used it as packing material .
margo , these are n't seed pods .
what are they ?
like the claw .
when it got to the museum , it hatched .
the plant 's infected with a virus .
like the burls on maple trees .
`` quadrupedal . ''
all those people in one enclosed space ...
what 's going on ?
do you have a flashlight ?
dr. frock . did you hear that ?
what 's that ?
we have to help .
i 'm coming with you .
come back and get me .
we will .
dr. frock ?
how many storage areas are there ?
do you mean dr. whittlesley ?
something tried to get into this room !
yes .
places where someone could hide ?
where is that ?
no one 's been down there in years .
do n't put her in danger .
what 's that ?
you work here ?
yes , i do .
what do you do ?
what do you do ?
what 's a revolutionary what ch'a ma ' callit ?
that lady said they were on the fourth floor .
we 're not supposed to go back there .
i do n't want to go this way .
quiet !
what is it ?
at the bottom was a big shadow .
big as a house .
not that big .
and it snuffled the ground like a dog .
they were yellow !
the ink is so faded .
maybe we should head back .
they 've got something .
shut them up !
stop !
argo ! hobbes !
it 's hobbes ! he 's all right .
we ca n't leave them alone .
what is this place ?
oh ... my ... god !
jesus , what is this ?
oh no . i smell it .
call dr. frock . he wanted a demonstration .
margo , you have n't heard ?
what ?
what in the world is going on ?
mbwun .
what do you make of it , margo ?
turkish gecko , i believe . a lizard .
impossible . the sample must be contaminated .
what kind of egg is it ?
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones !
eats them ?
is dr. frock safe !
got to finish this thesis sometime .
how about lunch ?
i guess i was snooping . what is this ?
i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator .
is he really dead ?
maybe not .
if he were alive he 'd have contacted me .
everyone on board was killed .
and john ?
disappeared . his body was n't among the victims .
he was a fine man despite his problems --
you loved him .
you were going to be married .
how did you know that ?
i also found a record of your restraining order .
he would n't leave me alone .
you were afraid of him , were n't you ?
by the end he was a joke .
what was he looking for ?
a legendary monster called mbwun .
a monster ?
what happened ?
was he desperate enough to create one ?
i do n't understand .
imbedded in beauregard 's body we found a claw .
my god . then it was an animal .
did whittlesley 's monster have claws ?
it 's in the exhibit .
where would we find it ?
what happened ?
i saw two green eyes in the dark .
where did you see it ?
that 's not what i saw .
dr. green ...
are you sure there are enough men in there ?
they 're all heavily armed .
but i saw something .
what was it ?
pendergast ? are you all right ?
you 're not . where is it ?
gone .
wounded ?
i think it was bothered by my light .
our guns are useless --
that was d'agosta .
the planetarium !
is there another way around ?
hide quickly !
what is it doing ?
what happened ?
and it could n't smell us through the glass .
what does that mean ?
i think ... it means it 's full .
then it wo n't go after the others ?
for what ?
we have to try and draw it off !
how ?
help someone !
you smell that ?
we 're not going to make the storage room !
pendergast , you were right . it 's john !
what ?
i do n't believe it .
just like john . he wo n't listen .
i have to shoot .
call him , margo .
i ca n't !
what 's the occasion ?
how can i help ?
i want to book a flight to fiji .
where exactly ?
< i > fiji. < /i >
what island ?
i 'm sorry , er ... the biggest one .
viti levu . for how many ?

< i > a month. < /i >
it 's the busy season .
but you would n't want to do that .
why would n't i ?
i thought you were in a hurry .
that 's right .
you want to book the flight ?
close up ?
is that the best shot we can get ?
what 's to see ?
what happened down there ?
give me a shot from truman 's ring .
everyone else is at first positions .
all prop cars accounted for ?
what have we missed ?
we 're not watching the sea .
why would we --
cue music ...
he does n't care .

amnesia .
that 's how he can support an entire channel .
a window onto the human condition ?

never needs sharpening . dishwasher safe .
how did it go today ?
i was hoping we could have a special evening .
i wo n't be late .
where have you been ?
i 've been thinking --
oh , god .
-- i figure we could scrape together eight thousand .
you 're talking like a teenager .
maybe i feel like a teenager .
is n't that enough of an adventure ?
what 're you doing down here ?
fixing the mower . i saw my father today .
i know .
how do you know ?
what did you want ?
i made macaroni .
good night , mother .
let 's go for a walk .
i 'm sorry , i 'm late .

let 's go now .
what about atlantic city ?
you hate gambling .
i do , do n't i ?
so why do you want to go ?
beautifully synchronized , do n't you agree ?
you blaming me for the traffic ?
truman , that was our house !
there 's been an accident , truman .
truman , i took the `` hypocrite '' oath !
truman , what about that sign ?
you ca n't stand me .
no artificial sweeteners --
-- what the hell are you talking about ? !
i 'll do it . i swear .
who were you talking to ? !
you 're the one talking to the walls !
who were you talking to ? tell me !
how are you , mother ?
well , i made it through another night .
how 's your hip ?
they never found dad 's body -- maybe somehow --
we ought to be getting you back , mother .
you slept all the way there .
it looks so small .
fine . can you pass on a message ?
i 'll call her when i get there .
when you get to fiji ?
you got it .
now what ?
they had to shut her down .
is there any way around ?
the whole area 's being evacuated .
well , thank you for your help .
they 're coming . any minute .
who ?
they 're going to stop me talking to you .
there 's no one here .
there 's nothing left to explore . ''
were you there -- how do you know ?
the point is , you got scared .
i do n't understand .
how 's it going , truman ?
not bad . i just won the state lottery .
see you tomorrow , truman .
do you live around here ?
not supposed to talk about it .
i think you better tell us .
we do n't even know you .
well , we 're fbi agents .
poopy day ?
yup .
what do you do ?
i think that about does it , spooky .
what am i doing here ?
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
you called 911 . except the call was intercepted .
i need your clothes , byers .
you 've been back to dallas ?
-- those are very serious allegations , agent scully --
we 're working to develop this evidence --
working with ?
what is it you find incredible ?
you 've got something to show me .
brought on by what ?
this man 's still alive .
before it gestates ?
and if it 's unsuccessful ?
yes .
we have a situation . the members are assembling .
who called this meeting ?
a course has already been taken .
someone has tipped him .
who ?
is this dr. kurtzweil 's residence ?
you got some kind of business with him ?
i 'm looking for him .
real nice business he 's got , huh ?
what 's that ?
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil ?
have you examined them ?
how 's that ?
do i know you ?
you follow me out here for a reason ?
my name 's kurtzweil . dr. alvin kurtzweil .
i know the name . why ?
how 'd you find me ?
figured you 'd be needing a little drinky tonight .
ob-gyn .
who sent you ?
and what 's that ?
he just let it explode .
why that building ? why not the federal building ?
the federal building was too well guarded .
those people were already dead .
before the bomb went off ?
michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
i think you 're full of shit .
somebody knows i 'm talking to you .
not according to the men in blue .
they want to discredit you -- for what ?
because i know too much about the truth .
i just did n't know why .
was n't i , agent mulder ?
a virus . there were rumors about its origins .
what killed those men ?
they have the future to protect .
a plague ?
negotiating with whom ?
fema , agent mulder . the secret government .
and they tell me i 'm paranoid .
how can i reach you ?
you found something ?
something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks .
what ?
i 'm not sure . a virus --
-- you saw this experiment ?
what do you think ?
the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
that would be my guess .
you told me you had answers .
yeah , well i do n't have them all .
you 've been using me --
i 've been using you ? !
mulder -- it 's me --
where are you , scully ?
i 'm on the roof .
did you find something ?
no . i have n't .
what 's wrong , scully ?
you 're looking for a bomb .
mulder ... ?
jesus , mulder ...
now what ?
had you .
no you did n't .
there was a moment of panic .
have you ever seen me panic , scully ?
a saline iv ?
scully ...
scully , i found the bomb .
where are you , mulder ?
scully , get somebody to open this door .
... thirteen fifty six ...
scully ?
something 's not right ...
we ca n't let them .
they 're splitting us up .
why ?
but i think this goes deeper than that .
they 're doing this to me .
not after what i 've seen and done .
i wake you ?
no .
are you drunk , mulder ?
go home , mulder . it 's late .
get dressed , scully .
mulder -- what are you doing ?
according to this tag .
it 's like jelly .
i 'd been told as much .
of what ?
i 'm in serious violation of medical ethics .
why are you whispering ?
i ca n't really talk right now .
what did you find ?
evidence of a massive infection .
what kind of infection ?
i do n't know .
i 'm getting you a ticket , too .
mulder --
you said you were n't coming ?
what did you find ?
how was it contracted ?
and you 've never seen anything like that ?
this looks like new grass to you ?
very recently , i 'd say .
all the equipment is brand new .
i do n't know , mulder .
what are my choices ?
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction .
where would they be going ?
yeah , well they may this one .
what are you not telling me here ?
this virus -- it ...
mulder --
it may be extraterrestrial .
what do you think it is ?
this is weird , mulder .
cool in here . temperature 's being regulated .
you hear that ?
like electricity . high voltage maybe .
scully ... . ?
yeah ... ?
what are you doing ?
where 'd they go ?
what ? what 's wrong ?
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation .
you ca n't quit , scully .
i have . i did . it 's done .
to reign you in . to shut you down .
what ? what happened ?
scully ...
i think you 're in anaphylactic shock --
scully --
cold ...
we 've got to keep moving .
where are we ?
i ca n't go any farther .
on whose orders ?
i do n't know anything about that .
well , call general mcaddie .
i do n't have his number .
about what ?
that the fbi did n't do its job .
agent mulder --
how deep does this go ?
are we being watched ?
what are you doing ?
mr. mulder .
what happened to kurtzweil ?
where 's scully ?
i have answers for you .
is she alive ?
about the conspiracy ?
a word your father liked to use .
it must be administered with ninety six hours .
you 're lying .
a virus ?
and attacks .
a disease ?
this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs .
that mass infection would make us a slave race .
the infected firemen , the boy --
where is he ?
let me out . stop the car .
or it may not .
what alien environment ?
only her science can save the future .
what about you ?
about our place in their colonization .
turn over a body infected with the gestating organism .
!
to start colonization early .
has he outlived his usefulness to us ?
he 's a toiler . a crank .
he 's got too much light on him .
sing a song of sixpence ...
a pocketful of rye ...
did we go sailing ?
he hates me .
she adores you .

we lost our key .
or a rat . it 's an urban myth .
exactly . always happened to someone else .
it 's about a beach .
you think ? ! based on what ?
no one follows that midrash .
what 's a fascist ?
he 's a jewish nazi . he always was .
whereas avi 's a zionist nazi .
they do n't have extermination camps .
they sound like you .
and i think fuck it ... .
right in the store ?
fucking danny , man ...
what ? ?
that 's a movie , you moron .

yeah , but not on the letters .
why the fuck not ?
i have a job .
i 'll give your group a thousand bucks .
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine .
things were possible that are n't now .
actually , i think this moment has possibilities that --
people still need values , beliefs ... .
i do n't care about money .
you will .
have you read toynbee ? spengler ?
nobody reads that stuff anymore .
too difficult ?
disease ? what disease ?
what do you do ?
in queens . i drive a fork-lift .
where 'd you read all that stuff ?
why no silencer ?
that 's where they met .
are they still together ?
mostly on .
is he a nazi ?
he does n't care about that .
what 's he care about ?
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ?
your friends .
i 'm with one right now .
oh , really ?
bigger and better .
who 's linda ?
why wo n't you talk to me ?
when can i see you ?
your father ? ?
i 'm coming to your room tonight .
where 'd you get this ?
every word . every letter .
do you know it like that ? by heart .
no .
right ?
it goes the other way .
i want to learn to read it .
okay ?
hebrew 's very difficult . it would take years .
that 's stupid .
what assholes .
who gets contaminated , the jews or the gentiles ?
good question . both . aleph ...
it looks a little like a swastika .
where are they ?
besides the hebrew lessons ...
the sex is better .
even though his dick is so big ?
with you there 's a tragic dimension .
payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem ...
v'asitem ...
or not believe . judaism there 's nothing .
nothing but nothingness ... judaism 's not about belief .
what 's it about ?
and belief follows ?
you submit to the torah .
fuck that .
do n't curse in front of it .
why should i submit ?
no , i think you should n't .
you 're learning the hebrew really fast .
i told you , i 'm good at this .
what ... ? you think i 'm jewish ?
nazis talk about it all the time .
not in a billion years . you know why ?
'cause he was n't a rabbi .
kaddish is the prayer for the dead .
he studied torah . he hated jews .
is it like eichmann ? are we goofing ?
i just want to try it .
shit ... did you talk to your mother today ?
no . what are you looking for ?
or we can submit .
and be crushed .
then we 'll eat . you have to eat .
she said you might come , so i ...
you got ta get out of here .
kill any jews yet ?
i did n't realize you cared .
i doubt it . how did you find out ?
i thought there were people here ... .
who 's eichmann ?
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod .
what 'd you say ?
why are you taking that ?
did you see how they reacted to him ?
an investment banking house .
more cultural than political .
obviously .
that would be a catastrophic mistake .
people hate jews . do you agree ?
you would n't announce it ?
it will look like germany all over again .
the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven .
... what 's the point ?
they 're liars and cowards .
but what do we accomplish by pointing it out ?
i came to say goodbye .
what about mrs. moebius and ... ?
how soon can you get back to the city ?
there 's something i want to do here first .
is it okay if i record this ?
he 's not a thinker .
so does that mean you 're a white supremacist ?
ibos , bantus , mandingos ...
a poison ... ?
let me give you an example ... . sexuality .
sexuality ? ? ? what do you mean ?
you ever fuck a jewish girl ?
what ? ? ! ?
why ?
and ? what did you notice ?
notice ? like what ... ?
jewish girls like to give head , right ?
i do n't know . is that right ?
and jewish men like to get it .
everybody likes to , do n't they ?
you know why ?
why ?
because the jew is essentially female .
a normal man .
does that mean the jew is the better lover ?
it 's that they 're sexually corrupt .
but the jew does n't have soil .
he has israel .
those are n't jews .
of course they 're jews .
nothingness without end ...
excuse me ? ... you 're kidding , right ?
and you call yourself a reporter ?
so you 're saying it 's not true .
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else ?
who am i fucking with here ?
listen to me ... .
why would nadelman lie ?
give me a reason not to .
did you kill ilio manzetti ?
last week you went to a torah study group .
what were you , following me ?
how do you reconcile the two ?
i do n't think you know what you are .
a presbyterian ? impotent ? a prick ?
not write about me ?
will you go to synagogue ?
i always won .
why did you come tonight ? to see me ?
to hear them read torah .
i ca n't help what i think .
tell me about lina moebius .
how did you ... ?
which < i > times < /i > guy ?
bullshit . what kind of gun did you use ?
a forty-five .
it was a nine millimeter .
you 're lying .
you want to kill me ?
i ca n't say that .
danny , i 'm trying to -- save you .
who do you think you are ?
how did you get the fucking number ?
i do n't do that .
you do it on the inside ... .
no !
lina moebius . and you are ... ?
daniel balint .
balint ?
it 's german .
what part of germany are you people from ?
from the rhineland originally .
balint ? ... or any other law enforcement agency ?
curtis is afraid you 'll marginalize us .
is n't that precisely our appeal ?
so what jew would you kill first ?
do you feel you 're making progress here ?
you mean ilio manzetti ?
how have things been going ?
hello ... ?
lina ... it 's happening . tonight .
what is happening ?
beth shalom . like you wanted .

look , you want cheese , go someplace else .
you admit it 's stupid .
why is n't it stupid ?
steve ...
what are you doing here ?
but he did n't want to be any trouble .
then he could n't be bitter about living alone .
you know what it means ? to your people ...
they 're not my people ... .
tell it to hitler .
what kids ? ...
the polacks ? from sacred heart ?
you can heat them up and --

mrs. moebius .

you know charlie how-come ?

more or less .
that 's one reason i wanted to see you .
about charlie 's leopard ?
it could be a man .
it was a man !
yes , but what sort of a man ?
i do n't know .
to the eye ? like other men .
it was you , galbraith !

he wo n't listen to me .
did galbraith make a direct accusation ?
state hunters ?
yes . the lipstick .

 as long as my feet held out .
that was nice of mr. galbraith .
i know . funerals .
and she waited here for him ?
it 'll only make you feel badly .
maybe i want to feel badly .
what else do you care about , kicks ?
kiki -- it was n't the leopard .
you 're positive of that , are n't you ?
now we 've got to do it ourselves .
kiki ?
we stood here once before .
come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps ?
aint nobody out there , mister .
it says closed to the public , doesnt it ?
thats right .
will you please come with me ?
that might depend on where youre going .
they are expecting you .
i was asked here by a mrs spitz .
good afternoon . de moraess residence .
you know , just before he disappeared ?
would you like a drink while you wait ?
appearances can be deceptive , mrs de moraes .
carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him .
now you are confusing me , mrs de moraes .
can it be that easy ?
can it be that you want your brother found ?
i found this at your brothers .
disney ! how inter ...
i see you dont require a definition .
you ... you found that at leons ?
where is he ?
but hes being well looked after .
excuse me ?
youre fired , mr lombard .
perhaps i should come back when youre ...
who do you think we are , mr lombard ?
i trust you know who i am talking about .
come in and close the door , will you ?
you lost my money ?
and friedman left this morning for los angeles .
who is friedman ?
the man who sold the boy to your brother .
that information could have cost me £20,000 .
are we understood ?
huh ! really ? hotels ?
mr lombard ?
have you got a pen ?
just a moment ... go ahead .
have you found mr friedman ?
paul lamont , all right ?

arent you curious to know about friedman ?
black suits you .
sorry ?
i ...
youre mad ...
my brother hung himself .
leon hung himself ...
but you knew that , didnt you ?
leon could still have hung himself .
but dont presume to understand .
i dont .
good .
is there anything to understand ?
why do i feel i neednt answer that ?
you bastard ...
you splendid bastard ...
are there truly no extenuating circumstances ?
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright .
something like that .
something like that ?
something like that .
here we go again .
where is that ?
simplify and damn .
dont you believe in simplicity ?
should i ?
but its never that complicated really .
i volunteered ...
to get me killed ... ?
well , i hope you enjoyed yourself .
as i said earlier , an autopsy will ...

okay . recommended ...
i hope you can appreciate that , mrs spitz .
i take it your son is called leon ?
how did you do that , mrs spitz ?
do what , mr lombard ?
then you should not have sought an explanation .
i presume you checked your sons apartment ...
yesterday . it all looked normal .
did you look for his passport , driving licence ?
he has had girlfriends , but nothing serious ...
the £1,000 is on account .
my rates ...
he might achieve everything your son never did .
what happens now ?
you can do anything you like .
anything at all ?
vous êtes français ?
problems ?
is my money in there ?
lets go .
am i supposed to know him ?
he bought a boy of yours .
clients come and go .
friedman lives with you at the ambassador ?

get rid of them and were out of business .
maybe i dont .
im overcome by your public-spiritedness .
free . and hope you never die .
huh ... im sure thered be lots of takers .

phil doesnt know where i live .
i havent seen leon for months .
he just said he had good reasons .
good reasons ?
he did .
his mother would be pleased to hear that .
im afraid i dont understand .
do you know leons parents names ?
who else knows about the boy ?
my sister ... she lives in the next valley .
is she on the phone ?
whats your sisters number ?
im sorry . its just you dont look local ...

whats the date ?
the nineteenth ... how come you didnt know ?

quest-ce que tu veux ?

cinq cents .
pas avant la matinée .
où est passé ton salon ?

if you wan na see whats left of him ...
the acid bath ?
it upsets people . its wrong . fucking wrong .
why did you kill him ?
nice way to help a colleague in trouble .
if he had , youd be dead .
so why didnt he ?
what do you think , huh ?
i think youd rather not know what i think .
try again , and this time be polite .
he didnt need your confession ...
youre sure he said his caller was a man ?
when they realise im missing ...
what you gon na do ? kill me ?
moreau ? cest moi . alors ...

sometimes i really wish i could be someone else .
that 's a good idea , sire .
of course i am , it 's just that ...
very generous of you all . how much ?
my dear aulon ... that 's fine ...
... or his hands ?
i would like some fresh straw .
and i would like to see a priest .
now ?
yes . i did n't confess today .
now ?
i also need someone who can read and write .
i thought you were an archer ?
who do you want to write to ?
who do they think i am ? !
jeanne , stop it !
good .
what 's going on ? !
go on ... we 're almost there ...
the king said you 're his finest archer ... ?
well ...
are you alright ?
yes ...
i 'll go .
jeanne ... ! are you alright ?
why are you staring at me like that ?
they 've abandoned me ... like everyone .
what ... what do you mean ?
since the coronation ... no signs ... nothing ...
maybe it 's a sign to go home ?
i do n't know it . i feel it .
tell me ...
meanwhile ... i 'm going to compiegne .
but it is what i want .
will you at least let me stay with you ?
we must sound the retreat !
but ... why ... what 's the point ?
do as i say !
i want to stay with you ...
my gentle captain ... i 'm staying .
i -- i do n't understand ...
one day you will .
you , a lady of title !
it will purify me ...
jeanne 's alive !
good .
we have to press home the attack !
sound the retreat ...
but i promised jeanne we 'd fight on !
sound the retreat for the night !
but that was her order !
!
no ...
did god forbid you to tell the truth ?
i tried to .
it was on a sunday , was n't it ?
do you have a sword ?
quite a few .
did n't you also carry a banner ?
and ?
and so i ... i prefer my banner .
why ?
yes , probably ... maybe ...
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword ?
like this ?
am i correct , bishop ?
and when was that ?
well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...
w-w-what are you doing ? !
arrest them !
that is your prerogative .
scared of a girl ?
you look pretty ordinary to me ...
am i ... am i dead ?
dead you 're worthless , darling .
where ... where am i ?
my king will pay any ransom you ask .
god defeated the english , not me .
are you alright ? did they hurt you ?
quick -- hide in here ...
but where are you going to be ?
who are you ?
trial ? what trial ? ?
the english ? ?
where were you born ?
in a village called domremy .
how old are you ?
nineteen ... or thereabouts ...
were you baptized ?
yes . in the church at domremy .
recite the lord 's prayer .
these questions have nothing to do with your trial .
not long ago ...
a day , a week -- when ?
what were you doing when the voice came ?
praying .
the voice was in your cell ?
yes .
what did it tell you ?
many things ...
yes ...
is that what you want ? ?
please ... may i have it back ...
you tricked me ... !
why ?
he 's feeling wonderful .
thanks be to god .
and your duke ? the duke of bedford ?
buying her ?
you think ?
you will ? ?
but ... her army 's so small now ...
there 's no need to be afraid , sire .
you did well ...
... you look wonderful ...
she says she 'll be here tomorrow ... !
what difference does it make where she comes from ?
... as always , majesty ...
part of it ... or all of it ?
his face .
does he have hair ?
yes .
by what he said ?
go on to the next question .
5,000 gold crowns .
that 's not a lot .
were you sent by lord dunois ?
yes ... they were .
good . where are the english ?
everywhere . where is the food ?
i know ...
good . can you bring me to him ?
wait , wait ...
answer me ? !
can we -- uh -- discuss this later ?
the wind will be against us ...
what 's going on ?
stand by with the battering-rams ...
we need another ten minutes ...
well ... ? shall we go ?
not yet .
!
yes , it 's a miracle .
damn right !
yes . we can pray .
this is no good !
and ... what does jeanne think ?
but the bridge has been pulled down !
clear ?
is n't this what you wanted ?
do we let them go too ?
jeanne ... we 're not enough ...
so ... bring up the reinforcements !
jeanne , look behind you .
do you know how to count ?
who told you to wear men 's clothes ?
i 'd rather die than fall into their hands .
did your voice tell you to jump ?
yes , but ...
and you did n't jump of your free will ?
no !
stop it ! what are you doing ?
why not ? he has good teeth ...
besides , what about these ... ?
yeah ...
?
what happened ? who gave the order to attack ?
god knows , but it was a bad idea !
prepare these as battering-rams !
what 's the use ? the drawbridge is up !
we ... won ? !
all this ... this blood ... this smell of ...
mmmmmmm ! i love it !
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first !
jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ...
you do n't believe me anymore ?
yes ... a half-steed ... white .
who gave you that horse ?
my king .
how many did he give you ?
five steeds and a few hackneys ...
jeanne ... what are you doing ?
what have you done to me ?
who ... who are you ... ?
are you god ?
what are you doing out here ?
i might ask you the same question .
it 's your lies you ca n't stand anymore ...
what do you want from me ?
why were you yelling like that ? !
please ... leave ... you ca n't stay here ...
why ? are you waiting for someone else ?
yes !
yes ... that 's what i pray for ... !
why not ?
they wo n't come anyway .
what do you mean , they wo n't come ?
why would they ?
god asked you to do something ?
i ca n't remember ... leave me alone !
i did n't kill that man !
so your memory 's coming back ?
in his name ? ?
you fought for yourself , in your name .
or should i have let myself be killed ?
i never took pleasure in hurting anyone ?
do you think this cross will protect you ?
`` love your enemies '' ...
i do n't think so .
yes i am .
are you willing to follow all his commandments ?
you think you are ready now ?
yes , my lord .
i need to confess .
but you already confessed this morning ...
i need to confess again .
there 's no sin in charity , jeanne .
mine were too small .
whose were they ?
my father 's .
oh yes ... very .
and your mother -- everything 's fine with her ?
so ... everything sounds ... wonderful ?
yes , it is .
then ... why are you here so often ?
and it 's where i can talk to him .
who is this `` he '' ?
he never says his name .
beautiful .
why did she have to die ?
!
i do n't want to wait for his call .
jeanne , be patient .
why are you here , mr. wladek ?
someone you know ?
a beauty . who is she ?
wladyslaw szpilman . marek gebczynski sent him .
i 'm going to get a doctor .
hello .
oh ! you 're bleeding .
meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful .

he 'll be back before curfew .
i need somewhere to stay .
how long have you been married ?
and how 's yurek ?

it 's not going to be very comfortable .
i 'll be fine .

i 'm on the run !
what 's happened ?
ca n't i take my chances here ?
have you seen this ?
calm down , what , what is it ?
halina ?

and suppose they take the table away ?
let 's enjoy our meal .
henryk , i said nothing bad .
they bombed us , we 're off the air .

that makes a change .
you know what we do ? we use psychology .
