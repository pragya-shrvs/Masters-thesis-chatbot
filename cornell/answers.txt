that it was n't an accident .

do n't keep calling me that .
originals ?
yes .
yes , sir . he does n't make copies .
oh yes .
oh , thank you , sir !
tonight ?

some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
is n't it obvious ?
then do n't . it 's up to you .
what ?
should we stay here ?
your husband is ill , ma'am .
why you ?
i was at hand .
well , thank you very much .
he needs me , ma'am .
no , he does n't .
he asked me to stay .
and i 'm asking you -
no . i was assisting him .
he 's not going to work on this anymore .
madame , i will respect his .
ah . well .
not at all .
where 's our friend ?
he 's not in .
i hope so . i need it immediately .
leave him alone !
i 'm paying these people .
he 's doing his best .
i 'm paying people just to wait for you .
you know what 's ridiculous ?
money ! money !
you 're mad ! she 's mad , wolfi .
oh yes , and who are you ?
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
in three months ! papa .
but you ca n't take her without reference .
well , this is none of your business .
and what do you expect ?
so you are !
do you hear him ? do you ?
be careful !
adorable !
behold !
hey !
behold !
i am sorry , madame .
do you know who i am ?
young man , i am no stranger to theatres .
gertrude !
you ca n't be herr mozart !
gertrude !
people who know say the girl 's got talent .
michael , please !
michael !
yes . he is a little strange .
ah , now ! here she comes .
who was your teacher ?
i was .
it 's just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
majesty .
let 's have some fun .
ah-ha !
well , there it is . now to business .
cattivo again , court composer .
your highness .
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes , of course .
i 'm sure there is a way , majesty .
sire .
well . there it is .
oh ?
molested , majesty .
well , look at them .
no , no , please !
the director of our opera . count orsini-rosenberg .
oh sir , yes ! the honour is mine .
really ? oh , grazie , signore !
because i 've already found the most wonderful libretto !
it 's actually quite amusing , majesty .
in a pasha 's harem , majesty .
ah-ha .
what ? on one hearing only ?
i think so , sire , yes .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ?
of course i do . it 's very good .
which few did you have in mind , majesty ?
enchanted , madame .
twenty-six .
thank you , sire !
may i introduce my father ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions .
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
i think you are rather innocent , my friend .
ah , love again .
but it 's new , it 's entirely new .
i have no idea .
guess ! guess , majesty .
twenty , sire ! how about twenty ?
you are passionate , mozart !
sire , the whole opera is finished .
well . there it is .
your majesty , herr mozart -
yes , what about him ?
he 's here .
ah-ha . well . there it is . good .
am i not welcome ?
of course , welcome ! welcome ten thousand times .
is she not here ?
i do n't know . stanzi ? stanzi !
oh , yes .
do n't you have a maid ?
how is your financial situation ?
it could n't be better .
that 's not what i hear .
what do you mean ? it 's wonderful .
they say you 're in debt .
who ? who says that ?
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i do n't know . it 's not important .
composition does n't pay . you know that .
this one will .
oh , let 's not talk about it .
why not ?
it 's a secret .
you do n't have secrets from me .
it 's too dangerous , papa .
why did n't you mention it in your letters ?
did n't i ? i thought i did .
why not ? oh , come , papa !
this is just a game , papa .
but my penalty .
mine ?
i never saw this girl in my life .
papa !
she does . she says i sleep all day .
hush ! i 'm talking to his majesty .
good morning , sir .
what have you got for me today ?
i will , sir .
yes , thank you , sir .
bene ! bene !
bene .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i 've seen .
then how does he pay for all this ?
oh , yes , sir , all day long .
really ? what is it he 's writing ?
oh , i would n't know that , sir .
of course not . you 're a good girl .
in there , sir .
i 'm leaving .
why ? what has happened ?
you do n't know what it 's like .
i do n't know . he has pains .
where ?
here , in his stomach .
is he working ?
i 'm frightened , sir . really !
is he working ?
i suppose so .
please do n't ask me to go back again .
are you sure it 's an opera ?
are you herr mozart ?
that 's right .
my name is lorl , sir .
stanzi-manzi-banzi-wanzi !
sssh ! stay here .
sublime ! utterly sublime !
that kind of music should be punishable by death .
yes , well , it 's all good fun .
i liked the horse .
i 'd like to try them someday .
animals ?
of course !
no , no , i love that .
so there you are . what do you say ?
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
put it down , i said !
oh ! i 'm sorry ! i 'm sorry !
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what 'd you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there 's nothing to see .
so let me see it . where is it ?
madame .
this is herr mozart , my dear .
of course , it 's him .
strudel , this is herr mozart .
well , yes ! on the whole .
well , i 'm a good teacher .
well .
please .
my answer is no , mozart .
mio caro adone .
ah !
ah , love !
but this is absurd !
did you like it , then ?
how could i not ?
she is well .
i 'm flattered .
why ? here is the music .
i have just come from the palace .
filled ? that 's impossible !
herr sommer .
sommer ? herr sommer ?
an implausible idea .
how is that possible ?
they 're stupendously successful .
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
i 'm afraid not .
i 'd better not .
come , come , mozart ; i 'm interested .
actually , it 's a big secret .
ah . italian ?
forgive me .
what exactly are you working on ?
i ca n't say . really
it 's unbelievable !
really ? why ?
i do n't know .
why bother with orsini-rosenberg ?
oh , i could kill him !
oh no !
how fortunate .
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you ! oh , thank you .
i know ; it 's outrageous .
well , i can speak for the emperor .
i think it 's marvelous . truly .
it 's the best opera yet written .
i would n't presume .
oh no , the honour would be all mine .
grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !
grazie , a lei , signor antonio !
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not , excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
oh no !
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ? who is dead ?
i am only a messenger . do you accept ?
how much ?
work fast .
are you neglecting my request ?
no , no !
i 'm taking you home .
no , no . i have to get back .
not here ! she 's not well , either .
you mean she 's not coming back ?
you 're so good to me . truly .
no , please .
i mean to come to my opera .
this is only a vaudeville .
oh no . it is a sublime piece .
i do .
i have bad fancies .
the doctor thinks i am . but -
what ?
i 'm too young to be so sick .
no ! no , it 's him !
who ?
the man . he 's here .
what man ?
he knows . he knows !
yes .
of course .
then , let us try together .
a mass . a mass for the dead .
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?
oh , yes .
strange !
come . let 's begin .
we ended in f major ?
yes .
so now - a minor . suddenly .
what time ?
common time .
yes .
i think so .
sing it back .
yes .
please ! just one moment .
first bassoon and tenor trombone - what ?
with the tenors .
also identical ?
exactly . the instruments to go with the voices .
oh no . now for the fire .
i think so .
show me .
yes , yes - go on .
yes , and on 'dictis ' .
yes !
you go fast !
do you have it ?
yes .
then let me hear it . all of it .
oh no . i 'm not tired at all .
we 'll stop for just a moment .
i can keep going , i assure you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
i was foolish .
exactly .
but , your majesty -
just let me tell you how it begins .
certainly , herr director .
exactly . a dance .
taking out what you should never have put in .
what is what ?
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
on the contrary .
a little modesty would suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
mozart -
they hate my music . it terrifies them .
mozart -
show them one interesting modulation and they faint .
may i just do that , majesty ?
baron !
sire , only opera can do this .
mozart , music is not the issue here .
elevated ? what does that mean ? elevated !
i am father vogler .
about what ?
you tried to take your life .
so ?
in the sight of god that is a sin .
what do you want ?
do you understand that you have sinned ? gravely .
leave me alone .
i can not leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ?
that makes no difference .
are they ?
offer me your confession .
i do not seek forgiveness .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little .
where ?
here in vienna .
then you must know this .
i 'm surprised you do n't know .
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine ?
i did n't . that was mozart .
of course .
ah - you 've heard that ?
all vienna has heard that .
and do they believe it ?
is it true ?
do you believe it ?
should i ?
he was murdered , father ! mozart !
did you try ?
every day . sometimes for hours i would pray !
you can not say that !
no ? was mozart a good man ?
god 's ways are not yours .
all i ever wanted was to sing to him .
my son , no one can speak for god .
oh ? i thought you did so every day .
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries .
his funeral - imagine it !
yes .
i did .
no , you did n't !
i poisoned his life .
but not his body .
what difference does that make ?
no , father .
do n't pity me . pity yourself .
mozart is writing a new opera .
italian ?
exactly .
he 's setting that play to music ?
yes .
you must be mad .
i 've seen the manuscript .
where ?
never mind .
incredible .
the emperor has given him permission .
about the ballet .
ballet ? what ballet ?
yes , in the third act .
well done , sire !
what ? who the devil are you ?
i 've taken pity on you , my angel .
oh . well , thank you ! how wonderful .
well , promise then .
what do you mean - now ?
of course now .
i agree , baron .
indeed .
she did n't say .
excuse me , my dear .
show her in . then go to bed .
he did n't say , sir .
yes , i am looking after him .
can we come in ?
well , he 's sleeping now . better not .
but he 's all right ?
oh , yes . he 's just exhausted .
and say everything went wonderfully .
i 'll call tomorrow .
yes . and congratulations to all of you .
yes , indeed . goodnight to you all now .
the american ? yes , duck .
how did he look ?
i 'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist !
dr. hirsch ?
go about your duties .
yes , doctor .
yes , doctor ?
what exactly did he call out ?
he said 'jack ' .
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them .
yes , i believe he did .
come to my office , miss price .
yes , sir .
it 's a full moon . where is he ?
at my flat .
alex , has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies ?
yes .
what did he say ?
david says jack comes to warn him .
warn him ?
dr. hirsch , what 's wrong ?
i tried to investigate the attack .
they were lying .
no .
david has suffered a severe trauma .
is he all right ?
he does n't remember .
the zoo ? is he rational ?
yes , he is .
no , why ?
is david acting strangely ?
no , not really .
yes , i should think so .
right . now listen carefully .
yes , doctor .
you 're certain he 's lucid ?
he 's fine . we 'll come right over .
shall i send a car ?
no , a cab will be faster .
i expect you shortly .
tea would be nice .
i doubt it .
i beg your pardon ?
it was a wolf .
what ?
a wolf .
yes ?
you have n't eaten your lunch .
i 'm not very hungry , thank you .
i 'm afraid you have to eat something .
please , really . i 'm not hungry .
sorry .
call me alex .
aw come on , alex !
shall i be forced to feed you , david ?
this is absurd . i 'm not hungry .
right .
will you give me a break ?
i thought you were asleep .
i was . what are you reading ?
i 've just started it .
i dream of death mostly .
i 'm sorry .
it 's okay .
that 's not really a very proper question .
how old are you ?
twenty-eight .
i 'm twenty-seven .
i know .
now what do you want to talk about ?
was jack goodman your good friend ?
my best friend . my very best friend .
shall i read to you ?
what ? oh , yes , please .
yes , go on .
ahem , a word of explanation .
i 'm sorry i woke you up .
do n't be silly .
no , thank you .
that 's easy enough .
i keep having these really terrible dreams .
what ?
i 'm serious .
you 're being awfully forward , are n't you ?
good .
a werewolf ?
i 'll let you know the next full moon .
you 're to be discharged tomorrow .
your dead friend jack ?
yeah .
what do i think ?
i would think so .
yeah , i would think so , too .
very nice .
charming .
bathroom .
lovely .
the bedroom .
there is only one bed .
it 's nice to see you .
yes ?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
of course .
good .
i was awake and he was in my room .
but , david .
i was n't hallucinating .
that 's good , alex . reassure me .
anything .
werewolves simply do not exist .
i 've left those pills for you .
a doper werewolf .
see you later .
i 'm freezing .
the zoo ?
do n't you remember ?
i said goodbye to you .
i should be committed .
dr. hirsch will know what to do .
i do n't know why i feel so good .
pull over .
six people mutilated ?
david , stop !
jack is dead !
jack is dead .
rational ! ? !
what ?
we had an argument . he 's being silly .
i swear , i do n't know this girl .
will you shut up ! ? ! !
david , let 's go now .
david , do n't lose control .
control ! ? ! what control ! ? !
no .
no what ?
no .
well , all right then , be that way .
no .
no .
the doctor will be round later .
no .
right .
no .
no what ?
no !
i thought not .
yes , i should think .
he 's an american , you know .
i think he 's a jew .
why on earth do you say that ?
i looked .
yes , mrs. hobbs .
take these round now , will you please ?
has he been refusing food ?
nothing quite as dramatic as that , miss price .
you did , did you ?
hey , you asshole !
there 's no call for that kind of language .
queen elizabeth is a man !
now see here young man .
shakespeare was french !
this is n't mr. goodman 's idea .
why are you doing this to me ?
no , but we 're about to .
oh , come on , tell us .
no . you 've had your chance .
that 's very funny , that is .
you could have told them !
i was having a nightmare .
it 's nearly eight .
miss price , the other nurse that attended you .
what are you going to see ?
some , everyone does .
yes , but does everyone kill bambi ?
bambi ?
you 're in a hospital in london .
london ? where 's jack ?
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
the guy i was with .
get your fucking hands off me !
so they said .
how could there have been witnesses ?
sure , as a kid .
yes .
no .
i really do n't know .
of course not , david .
yes .
good .
david .
you 're not having a good time are you ?
oh , i do n't know .
i 'm sorry .
right .
you 're talking about the woman i love .
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein .
she says she 'likes me too much ' .
of course , the slaughtered lamb .
of course , the slaughtered lamb .
okay .
shall we ?
nice to see you .
listen , at least it 's warm in here .
look at that .
it 's a five-pointed star .
maybe the owners are from texas .
you ask them .
wrong .
you ask them .
what do you mean ? i 'm starving .
apparently so .
i do n't know .
come on , i 'm freezing .
i do n't know .
i have no idea .
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural .
i heard that .
what was it ?
yeah ?
a coyote .
there are n't any coyotes in england .
the hound of the baskervilles .
pecos bill .
heathcliffe .
heathcliffe did n't howl .
no , but he was on the moors .
yeah .
i do n't know . come on .
come on , where ?
anywhere ! i think we should just keep moving .
it 's circling us .
plan ?
let 's just keep walking .
do you think it 's a dog ?
a sheep dog or something .
walk away , jack .
walking away , yes , sir .
no .
not far enough . come on .
yeah .
where are we going ?
i 'll tell you when we get there .
well . i 'm glad we ... whoaa ! !
are you going to help me up ?
get the fuck out of here , jack .
thanks a lot .
this is too much .
hurting your feelings ?
why should you be surprised ?
debbie klein cried a lot .
i ca n't stand it .
so you know what she does ?
life mocks me even in death .
david !
what ? !
i 'm not listening !
the wolf 's bloodline must be severed .
will you be quiet ? !
what ? !
you survived and now you shall continue the curse .
what are you talking about ?
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said ?
stop it , jack .
beware the moon . the full moon , david .
jack , please go away . please go away .
david , please believe me .
listen to me !
nurse !
the supernatural ! the powers of darkness !
nurse ! oh god ! alex !
do n't be an asshole , david .
i wanted to see you .
okay , you 've seen me .
get out of here , jack !
david , tomorrow night is the full moon .
a monster . i know , i know .
what do you think ?
i think i 've lost my mind .
what , jack ?
the canines will be real .
i will not accept this ! now go away !
hi , david .
you do n't have to say anything .
you look awful .
thank you .
i did n't mean it .
what about the zoo ?
i want you to meet some people .
hello .
gerald is the man you murdered in the subway .
how shall i do it ?
come in , come in . please sit .
stay here .
lt. villiers and sgt .
send them in .
roger mathison , doctor .
what here ?
he 's on the telephone .
tell him i 'm out .
campari and soda would do nicely .
sorry , love .
i suppose guinness will suffice .
no .
we 've got spirits and beer .
no .
oh .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'd like some tea , please .
i do n't rightly know , sir .
that is precisely my point .
we 'll find him , not to worry .
you here again ? what do you want ?
but listen , tom , i
she 's a widow .
why not ?
yeah - sure !
i was the first one to see it .
no kidding .
matt ?
yeah .
yeah .
about twenty-four thousand .
it was more than that last week .
yeah .
here 's twenty-five thousand .
let me have ten bucks ?
ten bucks ?
yeah ?
where do you think i 've been ?
i remember once when your account checked .
yeah .
not yet , mr. clark .
and tell him not to delay .
yes , sir .
oh , is he ?
dickson does n't have to go .
what good will that do ?
take it easy , clark .
just pure luck !
not at all .
i know , dickson .
yes ! you said it , clark .
what about ?
we 'll discuss that in the board room .
what do you mean , help ?
no .
i ca n't ? you just wait and see .
you know what you can do with that !
where were you at twelve o'clock last night ?
that 's very simple . i was home .
oh yes , of course .
oh !
you understand ?
why , of course .
somebody must be in good humor .
it 's one of the boys from headquarters .
all right , jack , all right .
they took my keys yesterday .
do n't forget there 's a dead watchman downstairs .
i did n't kill him !
he wo n't believe it , mr. dickson .
fifty thousand dollars !
but i did n't kill that man last night .
you just mentioned her name .
she just came up for a drink .
get out , get out !
that 's your funeral .
i 'm sorry , dude , buti
that do n't do us any good .
why not ?
why , i could n't do that . . .
you do n't have to do nothing .
why , i needed a
am i ?
me ?
liar !
what is ?
running around . not your work .
line ?
yes , yes , it does .
see , we 're getting along famously !
well
well , what ?
well , are n't you going to invite me ?
you ? no can do .
no , they wo n't .
why are you so anxious ?
do n't you know ?
no .
i want to be near you !
no . no , i 'm not .
cyril !
my apartment .
i knew i could n't trust you .
come on up for just a few minutes .
what 's the matter ? afraid papa will spank ?
no .
a misunderstood bachelor .
what are you doing here ?
yes , sir .
let me see your cash book , will you ?
now ?
yes , now .
oh , yeah ?
this is my business .
john , how 's your wife this morning ?
much better this morning , thank you .
got a handkerchief ?
wait a minute .
i 'm feeling fine this morning .
that makes it unanimous .
thank you !
of course , let them in !
well , that 's too bad .
hello , darling .
nothing .
i 'm terribly sorry .
but i have to go , dear .
the theatre ?
you can take some of the girls .
the girls !

no .
last night ?

helen , you 're becoming more beautiful every day .
i do n't know .

why - well , i
ummm . stalling , eh ? anything new ?
yes , sir .
where is he now ?
in mr. sampson 's office .
now do n't you worry about it .

i do n't know .

say , come on . show a little enthusiasm .
aw , go on , forget it .
there you are .
you 're protecting somebody .
no , i 'm not mr. dickson !
yes , you are . you 're protecting somebody .
oh , i can explain about that later .
wait a minute . answer my question .
well . . . uh . . . i .
she was , was n't she ?
why pick on him ?
it 's an inside job .
why , certainly he can .
so have you . so have i .
why , you must be crazy .
he 's just confessed .
do n't worry , mr. dickson .
here 's the data on the clyde deal .
i 'm afraid he 's been stalling .
that 's just exactly what he has been doing .
what are you talking about ?
all right .
did you get the case for the securities ?
yes , sir .
mine too ?
yes , sir .
i 'll talk to them .
do n't you think i know it ?

he 's at a board meeting .
board meeting .
i 'm afraid so .

oh now , do n't be silly .
can you imagine that guy ?
now you 've got me worried , dear .
all right , dear .
do n't cry , honey .
something 's happened . he is n't trying anymore .
they must have turned him down .
yes .
sure , they 'd turn him down .
yeah . i got an idea .
mr. williams . . .
the big guys have got the screws on him .
yes , why ?

that 's what i 'm asking myself .
i know , i know .
teddy was killed last night .

i do n't know what i 'm saying .
nobody does work like this on-line .
you 're scaring me .

`` like this ? ''
you think i do n't know that ?
milo . why would he --
how should i know ?
even if all this were true .
i ca n't just walk away !

is n't there a stigma ? bankrolling this guy ?
stigma ? larry !
milo . surprised he 's not your guest .
we tried !
oh hi .
he 's pretty tight with his family .
we could move 'em up here .
he just likes to write code .
i think they call him the `` houseman . ''
milo ? gary boyd .
you would ? wow . when would we come ?
would you like a coke or something ?
oh . no thanks .
low enough to relay internet traffic .
it needs a more object-oriented language .
you 'd have to start practically from scratch .
i do !
yeah ?
... do i ?
somebody said i 'm just another philistine .
that 's insane .
that 's what i told her . my wife .
do n't spend too much time searching .
maybe i 'm going too fast .
too fast ?
take a look at this . slightly different approach .
you 're making me young again .
well -- you sent for me .
right ... right .
what 're you implying .
nothing !
i 'm sure .
definitely .
were the flags for teddy ?
just once .
did you ?
talk about work ? never !
i meant did you find other stuff to --
oh . yeah .
you 've been coming in early .
it helps . alice said it would help .
34,000 . but they 're real short lines .
the answer 's not in the box .
you look a little tired .
i 'm okay . it 's going well !
'have a look ?
sure .
... my dad was a compulsive gambler .
what would you tell the kids ?
... worse ?
cause he was a liar .
do n't be so hard on yourself .
'sorry about the late notice ...
i 'm not much good at handwriting .
oh , that 's right .
you see what 's hanging on the wall ?
i do know , gary .
i do know .
'start-up not 50 miles from here .

nothing does . still .
gary , do n't worry , we --

longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
let 's go .
longitude 109 --
wait ... he knows .
what ?
'knows i 'm altering the coordinates .
gary ?
just do it .
in exchange for endowments .
you do ?
i mean , it 's your life .
you are naive .
just thought his work should go on .
he was on the verge of something , too .
those really weird , short lines .
... you wan na work -- here ?
got out of my other commitment .
unlikely . all 14 cameras are frozen .
not yet .
keep looking .
what 're we looking for ?
any irregularity in the pattern .
let 's get him in here .
they know .
i 'm calling gary .
where we going ?
i launched skywire .
you know my name .
you know mine .
you 're famous around here .

did n't mean to pry .
no , i know what you mean .
graphical interfaces . for skywire ?
show me .
yeah ?
no . please .
`` there is no second place . ''
mine 's not the ceo .
right , right .
you 're compulsive .
mmm-more like -- i have a little trouble .
why 's that ?
long story . not that interesting .
then and now . but not right now .
she saved my life .
why would you do a thing like --
you thought about it too .
the day care ?
but why would they -- ?
you know . there is no second place .
oh yeah ?
they 'd frame him .
he 's out of prison ?
they 're already watching you .
hmm ?
no , no . never .
who can we trust ?
there 're so many disinformation sites about gary already .
right .
we could cross-reference a data base on media ownership .
certainly not at my happy home .
yeah , they dig stuff like this .
what ?
he 's got 12 satellites up .
a what ?
it 's a standard gui .
before they kill somebody else , too .
oh , man .
you mean -- break in ?
i do n't know --
oh . i liked you .
what 'd he say ?
`` a beautiful geek ?
gary .
thank god .
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into # 21 .
he does n't know about the day care .
hardly anybody does , that 's the beauty part .
yeah , that 's old , in a tree .
oh .
milo ?

unless it 's a diversion .
i could get it out of him .

of course , i had my nine-millimeter automatic .
no , did you use a condom ?
only sailors use condoms , man .
not in the nineties .
well , it means something to me .
thirty years of political and social upheaval .
i 'll tell him .
do you think she 's prettier than i ?
who ?
you know who .
no !
not now , austin .
sadly , no . hold on !
no , no , no .
indeed .
it 's a shame he was n't more headstrong .
shut up .
fair enough .
too right , youth .
oh , behave !
likewise .
i can explain . they attacked me .
do n't worry !
i 'm going it alone this time , vanessa .
i 'll secure the perimeter .
lay it on me .
i love you , austin .

hey , wait a minute --
here , have a piece of gum .

right . okay . moving on .
you shot me right in the arm !
my son ?
yes . scott !
thank you , herr doctor .
i like to see girls of that caliber .
dr . evil ?
yes , what is it ?
it 's about the sharks .
sea bass .
right .
they 're mutated sea bass .
really ? are they ill-tempered ?
please allow me to demonstrate .
do n't be so hard on yourself .
that 's not true , doctor .
hello , scott .
no .
you always do that !
thought i 'd stay in .
in due time .
but what if he escapes ?
i have a better idea .
are n't you going to watch them ?
i do n't want to .
what did you say ?
show me .
i had the group liquidated , you little shit .
i hate you ! i hate you !
right .
oh , really ? one-hundred billion dollars .
great .
how 's austin ?
he 's asleep .
you did n't ...
why ?
because you managed to resist austin power 's charms .
you ca n't judge him by modern standards .
i just do n't see it .
just wait .
of course not .
did you ever want to ?
austin is very charming , very debonair .
i know .
i 'm on with a friend !
i love you , vanessa .
well , it 's kind of weird .
we do n't judge here .
i do n't know .
no , he 's really evil .
scott .

sir august merryweather ?
normally , we 'd be eager to oblige --
seriously ?
of course .

peter ...
three days .
so i 'm still ...
out in india . so character-forming for the british .
have we met ?
you mean you do n't recall ? ?
promised ? who promised ?
there , look !
mr. john steed , please .
i 'm afraid that 's impossible .
impossible ?
as you see .
then you ca n't come in .
i have an appointment .
no women . not in boodles .
really -- what happened in 1922 ?
eh ? in here !
we have met ...
this is n't a game .
quite right , but we still make the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
people , too .
then who wins ?
you and i . together .
looks like rain , steed ...
let me guess -- 'father ' ?
something strange is happening .
ropes ?
he tried to warn us ...
you need treatment , mrs. peel .
watch me .
we want to help ... !
i thought i was a widow .
to you ... ?
the institute ... the funding ...
a cover ... for us . i 'm sorry ...
quite frankly ... it could have been you .
to find out who killed my husband .
the doors and walls are monitored , mrs. peel .
so am i .
next assignment ?
thank you , steed .
thanks , valentine ...
dr . darling , peter ... all you ...
an unholy trinity ...
you killed my husband .
for starters .
spoil the majority shareholders . in wonderland weather .
but i found you .
of course . i planned that , too .
but -- why ?
you disappoint me , emma .
'our revels now are ended . '
oh , no , emma .
i 'm already married ...
valentine , listen to me ...
right , bridesmaid .
ring ?
you 're mad .
entirely .
destruction of their local weather systems .
the result would be ...
chaos . transport paralysis . crop failure .
then what 's stopping you ?
one very small thing .
what are my choices ?
choices ?
i 'll never marry you .
and you must be steed .
i had a spot of bother at the door .
i should n't wonder .
1922 . why the kippers ?
dyed in the wool .
not by me .
i say , this is all terribly formal .
mother ?
a kipper . or a red herring ?
really ? i fail to see the connection .
i had a feeling you would . touche !
yes indeed . i need protection .
or half cocked .
ahh . perfect fit .
thank you , trubshaw ...
not all tradition is bad , mrs. peel .
a gentleman has to have a code .
and i suppose you 're the knight .
the most unpredictable piece on the board .
that 's predictable .
do we always follow mother 's instructions ?
for a man in my position --
i have no choice .
no thanks .
i meant me .
an eccentric recluse ?
june , july ... august ?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .
any other vices ?
all of a piece , really .
small talk . try the weather .
you should be dead . how do you feel ?
strange .
you were very lucky .
i was n't about to .
i mean your man trubshaw . your bullet-proof waistcoat .
i might say the same .
why should they think that ?
you told them .
frankly that 's how i remember it .
but that 's absurd .
that 's possible .
no . but he must know .
did you say formal ? i must dress .
how on earth can you tell ?
any ideas ?
common knowledge , mrs. peel ...
she had this in her mouth .
thanks ...
do n't bother . here 's a bus ...
is there anything that is n't ?
the prospero project was started by my husband .
filling in mother nature 's blind spots ... ?
exactly .
but if someone miniaturized the process ...
that 's what we were working on .
sounds as if someone 's hijacked your research .
... and by you , mrs. peel ...
then a mad millionaire .
... and by you , mrs. peel .
not that i know of . explanation ?
according to dr .
have i trespassed on a male prerogative ?
barely .
mrs. peel ... ?
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists .
was i ?
orders .
to kill me ?
nothing personal .
no trouble .
because you always obey orders ...
always . except ...
... when i do n't .
i could be convinced , if ...
it was n't me ; you have my word .
keeping a stiff upper lip ?
is that all ?
not for a moment .
you 're playing games .
are n't we all , mrs. peel ?
i thought you played by the rules .
i thought you did n't .
i 'm playing to win .
winning is n't everything .
you do n't trust me ?
as far as you trust me .
you lied .
i equivocated .
no idea who . no idea why ...
not to speak of .
i 'm a wanted woman , i know ...
why 's he called 'invisible ' ?
you 'll find out .
i 'll catch you up .
hurry ? what for ? i 'm just now --
you did n't tell her ?
have we been invited ?
it 's called black leather .
intoxicating . here , have one of these .
limpet bomb . small , very compact .
shall we ?
snuff . i must insist you try some .
'the merry widow ? ' i might have known .
have a look at this .
where are you going ?
no bother .
but --
what kept you ?
the plot . hello , we must be going ...
' ... in a beautiful pea green boat ... '
a fine night , mrs. peel ...
still a bit chilly ...
english weather .
as a matter of fact i have ...
our little paradise -- just made for two ?
not quite .
pity your mother came , too ...
must be . trubshaw 's busy .
you 're saying i have no choice .
mobile hq . in a blue funk .
it 's mother you have to convince .
decontamination -- ?
and you 've a new wardrobe .
i see .
or rather , you do n't .
half-brother to be precise .
father .
who 's now vanished .
makes two of us .
are you suggesting that dr .
getting to what ?
... and now ?
let me guess : wonderland weather .
very good , mrs. peel ...
i shall need a small plane .
you 're not venturing alone , surely .
global warming ?
jungle plants in the arctic ?
so you say ...
we want mrs. peel .
dead , i 'm afraid .
how did you guess ?
you reek of mrs. peel 's black leather ...
well , you found me .
brenda and i thought we 'd drop in .
she may not know .
amnesia ?
possibly . split personality ...
insane ... ?
who knows ? if dr .
why ?
she may try to kill you .
anyone particular in mind ?
you .
too late anyway .
impossible .
no . her husband , she says .
guilty until proven innocent ?
mother and father know best .
in your operation .
i think so , thank you so much ...
i feel sure of it .
i 'm alice .
she was ...
both , actually .
good .
you do n't say .
this way ...
ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
no , please ! i beg you ...
walk over to the window ...
let it be rain , please let it be --
stay by the window . by the window .
valentine peel .
perish the thought .
i was at harrow ...
but did they teach you this ?
you wish .
that 's not playing by the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
if you say so .
i do .
did i ? my mistake .
you are , and it 's behind you .
come , come .

sometimes right when you 're looking at them .
-- what are you doing here ?
i saw adcox 's back !

i knew when you came looking for the chemicals .
-- what were they doing there ?
they were for the fucking boat , brian .

when i was twenty .
oooh , very sophisticated . having fun ?
carrying swayzak 's notebook ?
let me tell you something .
why do you think marty came here tonight ?
so now you suddenly care about my future ?
yeah ...
straightest answer your department 's given me all week .
how 's it going ?
yeah ?

you think that 's really any of your business ?
well , you did invite me here .
marty did .
got anything to drink in there ?
homey .

i wanted to be a good one .
you told swayzak about our arson lead .
i did n't know it was a secret .
i was doing my job .
yeah ?
leave stephen out of this --
oh yeah , he 's the real fireman .
-- i work for the city .
you knew what we were asking you to do .
hi .
we still talking ?
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered .
i do n't know anything about it .
you could check .
your boss is lying , jennifer .
just take it .
that 's a dumb thing to say .
you 're right .
what 'll you do ?
i do n't have the slightest idea ...
i 'll see ya around , huh ?
it 's a small town .
hey , do i know you ?
who 's doing this ?
your first question should be who is n't .
then who --
-- no no , your turn .
i do n't have a story .
sure you do .
you got ta tell a story too , brian .
i ... i thought it was great .
right . light smoke , low roll .

look , everybody remembers your old man .
sorry , but it 's out of my hands .
your dennis ' kid . i work alone .
get used to me , inspector .

pest control .
what are you listening to ?
glass ?
do we have a language barrier here ? glass .
`` trychtichlorate is a binary structured -- ''
-- go to the bottom . under heat properties .
ever burned magnesium ?
but the right guess on this is arson .
i do n't guess .
what ?
i got it after we talked to ronald .
but he killed these guys .
but he could have killed everybody there .
what reason ?
why backdrafts .
no .
i 'm finished with swayzak .
and cosgrove .

i had thought you more expert .
i am not sure .
not yet , but i believe he intends to .
oh ! that will be sent after him .
the meeting is arranged .

a man of honor dies , but never apologizes .
mrs. john best !

he has paid off your uncle 's mortgage .
sirrah !
i will let down the steps for your honor .
you are going to drive to the frontier .
it is shameful -- infamous !
your honor must lower his voice .
all europe shall hear of this !
as you please .
the gentleman has nothing contraband .
yes , sir .
you come highly recommended by herr seebach .
herr seebach was a very kind employer .
for whom else have you worked ?
no one , sir .
only the agency of servants .
i believe they will deport you .
i have faced that problem before .
perfectly certain , because i shall make him tremble .
on the instant .
take to your legs , low irish dog .
have you had one ?
never .
but , for a time ... a passing fancy ?
not even that .
have you not a man whom you value ?
then you have never loved ?
your word `` empty '' makes me laugh .
it is my only object .
to make me wretched in two weeks .
to love you until death .
you will do as you please .
yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived .
poor man .
always , my dear one , never any further .
i know better than you do .
old fool !
agreed .
then you must get it .
with pleasure at finding the ribbon .
oh !
as much as possible .

old friend .

i thought i was gon na have an attack .
what do we do ?
whoever it is is n't shooting at us ...

none of that matters now .
can anybody hear me !
we found him like this !
i do n't know !
shut up , mueller .
what do you mean , alone ?
shut up . west 's dead .
we can still come out of this okay .
i asked for a policeman .
it 's ... too slow .
what do you like then ?
fifteen years ago under sergeant west .
they 're dead , are n't they ?
i 'm not telling you what happened .
tell me about them .
that 'd be my reaction too --
he 's lying .
well , why did n't you say so ?
i 'm serious --
yeah , we know , pike did .
you saw west 's body .
of course --
yeah --
they would have killed us both .
but not pike 's .
you wan na bet ?
oh , you do n't ?
do what ?
hunting -- we had to hunt him --
and the bodies ?
you wo n't find them .
epilepsy .
yeah . spent half his time in the infirmary .
no , did he tell you about it ?
what business ?
the creek bed --
mueller was alone in the cabin ?
yeah .
do n't know on a map .
how do you know that ?
just a guess .
sir , dunbar , sir !
you know how to work a pistol , dunbar ?
sir , yes , sir !
the rest of you , fallout for physicals !
your weapons , sergeant .
oh , bullshit , he 's a fucking convict .
why ?
west ... he 's dead .
so did we . why did n't you come ?
i ...
west 's . any kindling for afire ?
i mean i killed him .
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place .
we just want to check your pack --
why ?
do i ?
yeah ...
you hated west more than any of us .
if not you , then who ?
mueller .
oh , come on --
who you gon na trust , ray ?
enough to go to prison ?
look in my pack .
why ?
just look . little pocket .
you 're lying --
pull up my sleeve . right arm .
full clip to the body --
from up close or far away ?
his chest was hamburger --
that 's close range .
mueller and childs .
what do n't you know ?
this is a lot of information to be getting ...
we wait and i 'm a dead man .
but not the only victim , right ?
senator daddy must be thrilled .
i did n't kill him --
then who did ?
but you did n't .
no . poetic justice , though .
right in front of us .
i honestly do n't know .
mr. hardy ?
stop .
how many murders did you cover up ? one ?
my heart weeps .
there 's that word again .
huh .
sorry to disappoint .
because of what i saw .
because i was standing next to him .
but you ca n't prove it !
where are they !
maybe --
maybe what --
maybe he ...
been better .
what kind of trouble are you in ?
would i have called you if it was n't ?
tell me what i can do .
it 's not west , is it ?
someone must have got a shot off .
from dunbar ?
nevertheless what ' ?
not for me .
jag gets here in three hours .
home , i 'm done .
what about the confession ?
i 'm talking about west !
was dead right .
yeah .
does osborne agree ?
maybe .
i would n't know where to start .
the senator ...
do n't be .
i thought you said that was n't a compliment .
what are you talking about ?
or what ? you 've gone round the bend --
west had a partner .
toxicology report came back .
you poisoned him , bill .
no !
you 're crazy --
you ca n't duck this , bill .
fantastic .
you knew sergeant west ?
he was our drill here .
sergeant west 's served for twenty- three years .
levi ? who names their kid levi --
senator jonathan kendall , of ohio .
christ ...
yes .
move him .
why ?
excuse me ?
is dunbar cute ?
that is the most unprofessional --
something like that .
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
you made me look like an idiot --
we 're in the middle of a murder case --
best time for banal chit-chat .
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib .
something like that . you ?
i lost a bet .
yeah .
you 're off to a late start .
so noted .
being back here . gives me the willies .
not the happiest of memories ?
got it .
everyone 's capable of murder , osborne .
i do n't know .
watch me .
you did more than try .
oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit !
but you will .
because it 's my job .
what ?
dunbar ... he said he did n't shoot west .
what happened next ?
and all hell breaks loose .
little bit .
let 's go talk to bill ...
they got their stories straight .
what ?
positive . hardy , they planned this .
you could n't have known --
yeah , i could 've . should 've .
you wanted to get the truth .
no , i did n't .
you mean the falsely accused ?
yeah .
so did i .
nah .
for what ?
that 's gon na stay my secret .
maybe ... maybe we were nowhere near .
good , just making sure .
get in .
is n't this how your story goes ?
where 's west 's body ?
no death certificates . no crime .
seven .
seven guys . what was it you said ?
this is the perfect time .
what if i do n't want it ?
tough .
there are degrees of truth , officer .
you 're a good man , hardy .
really .
nobody saw . but i do n't think so .
yeah .
leaving without saying goodbye .
nah .
want company ?
i should probably write that down .
yeah .
yeah .
mueller .
the faggot speaks .
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
poor fucker my ass ...
yeah and he does n't know when --
i remember now , it was before the explosion --
oh , you remember now --
so you took off your shirt ?
to start a fire , goddammit !
what , `` the truth '' ? please .
no one else heard it ?
he whispered it in my ear .
because he 'd shot mueller .
but you did n't see it , right ?
like i said , i was in the kitchen .
we 've been making progress , i see .
not much time to solve the crime .
then he 's mistaken .
it will and you know why ?
wait --
what .
wrong answer --
childs .
he came after us .
what the fuck happened to you ?
blame the nigger , then , huh ?
what the fuck are you doing ?
shut the fuck up .
i used it to start the fire --
terrible tragedy .
you mean ray dunbar ?
ma'am , ray dunbar 's black .
then it 's unofficial .
no --
it 's too neat .
he tried to burn dunbar to us .
i 'm giving you a chance to walk away .
it was on that night karl met his destiny .
that 's great .
tough break .
jesus , kid . let me guess .
yes !

i do n't understand . what about you ?

goodnight .
goodnight .
please , ilsa , do n't be hasty .
no , victor , no .
and as far away from major strasser as possible .

but no intention of selling them .
he suggested i ask you .
ask me ?
yes .
-- yes ?
i know how it is to be lonely .
no , victor , there is n't .

and about victor laszlo everywhere .
wo n't you join us for a drink ?
what for ?
your work .
thank you . i try .
we all try . you succeed .
not at all .
any time .
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table .
good evening .
i take that as a great compliment to sam .
well , is n't there some other place ?
right .
what of it ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said , ask your wife .
my wife ?
thank you .
had a close one , eh ?
yes , rather .
we might as well question why we breathe .
keep it . you 'll need it in america .
but we made a deal .
oh , never mind about that .
good .
all except one thing .
yes .
here it is .
yes .
i am captain renault , prefect of police .
yes . what is it you want ?
no .
very well .
no . two champagne cocktails , please .

with pleasure . wo n't you sit down ?
thank you .
well , perhaps i shall like it in casablanca .
-- thank you .
i believe you have a message for him ?
then we shall state another time and another place .

yes , even in berlin .
good day .
thank you , captain .
major strasser , my aide , lieutenant casselle .
what else , my dear major ?
good evening , captain .
how about new york ?
mademoiselle .
uh , huh . i have been thinking .
yes , much too good a time .
but i have no excuse to close it .
find one .
victor laszlo is on that plane .
ask monsieur rick .
why ? what 's in lisbon ?
the clipper to america .
waters ? what waters ?
i was misinformed .
huh !
this is no ordinary arrest .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
a wise foreign policy .
our entertainment is enough .
thank you .
victor laszlo .
victor laszlo ?
it 'll be interesting to see how he manages .
manages what ?
his escape .
oh , but i just told you . --
-- stop it .
twenty thousand francs says it is n't .
i just paid out twenty .
make it ten .
okay .
done .
he is traveling with a lady .
he 'll take one .
i think not . i have seen the lady .
the winning side would have paid you much better .
maybe .
oh , i see . gestapo spank .
excuse me .
-- hello , ilsa .
-- thanks . i will .
another precedent gone .
louis , are you pro-vichy or free french ?
serves me right for asking a direct question .
who knows ?
yeah ? why ?
why do you interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
well , i forgive you this time .
and i 'm taking a friend with me .
what friend ?
ilsa lund .
you did n't come here to tell me this .
then release him .
go ahead , ricky .
is everything ready ?
serves me right for not being musical .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
i have . sit down over there .
put that gun down .
you think of everything , do n't you ?
and the names are mr. and mrs. victor laszlo .
stay where you are .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .
as soon as the plane goes , louis .
my letter of transit ?
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses .
our expenses ?
uh huh .
i never make plans that far ahead .
sacha , she 's had enough .
do n't listen to him , sacha .
what is your nationality ?
i 'm a drunkard .
i have n't the slightest idea .
you will forgive my curiosity , mr. blaine .
good evening , mr. blaine .
put that phone down !

put it down !
hello ugarte .
oh , nothing .
no .
i forgot . you never drink with ...
i do n't mind a parasite .
myself . i found myself much more reasonable .
for how long ?
perhaps an hour , perhaps a little longer .
i do n't want them here overnight .
do n't be afraid of that .
do n't be a fool .
rick , hide me . do something !
he 'll double what i pay you .
yeah ?
boss , ai n't you going to bed ?
not right now .
you ever going to bed ?
no .

boss , let 's get out of here .
no , sir .
please , boss , let 's go .
she 's coming back .
we 'll take the car and drive all night .
no , sir . i 'm staying right here .
yeah , boss ?
i bet they 're asleep in new york .
just a little something of my own .
well , stop it .
no , i do n't .
yes , boss .
no , mr. richard .
worse than warsaw .
nobody remembers that .
the failures they remember .
catch another fish tomorrow .
stay calm , identify the problem .

the plane went down . my friends died .
the tide came in , the tide went out .
do n't overwhelm me with the details .
cliches , mainly .
so simple to say , so hard to do .
not when you have no choice .
i did n't know what really being alone was .
that 's what i told the fish i caught .
great . really .
i do n't know .
it means a lot ... that you came .
i had to come .
you too .
i 'm so glad you 're alive .
and how was your christmas ?

you were n't dreaming about me .
i was !
you were ! you *are* ! it was fantastic .
it was just the ether , wilbur ...
they just want you to hire some new help .
some new *things* would be useful .
let him try to *make* some money !
do n't you understand ?
dr. homer wells .
it 's because he 's too tired to sleep .
he *smells* like he could put you to sleep !
i 'm sorry , homer .
i know who you mean .
uh ...
and that i can drive a truck !
better than i can !
i doubt it . she 's just an ...
i do n't know .
she died of *secrecy* , she died of *ignorance* ...
i 'll tell them fuzzy was adopted .
i was lookin ' for wally 's letter .
daddy , it 's a letter to *me* .
he mentions homer , too , you know .
wally said to say , `` hello . ''
good night , daddy .
daddy , *please* ...
candy . candy kendall .

i ca n't have a baby alone .
sure ... i 'll see you around .
i 'm *never* bored !
when i 'm not thinking about wally .
yes .
when they watched at all .
yes ! i 've only seen one , though .
`` king kong '' . it 's really good .
i *did* like it .
she was torn apart !
oh , sure !
well , she was in a weakened condition ...
you think ? maybe i was .
yes ... and no .
i did n't say that .
i miss things . i miss ... people .
but you had so much *responsibility* .
i never *asked* for any responsibility .
just a little privacy .
ah-ha . so what is that -- a radio ?
the *speaker* . for the movie sound .
you just cuddle .
that 's what *i'd* come here for .
not with the right girl you would n't .
right .
it will be okay .
*what* will be okay ?
we have to wait and see .
i 'm just waiting and seeing .
i grew up with wally .
fine .
no !
well , we have to help her !
well , we ca n't force her .
you do n't understand ! it 's her father ...
mr. rose *knows* ?
he 's the *father* !
nothing .
is n't that like waiting and seeing ?
no . nothing is nothing .
i know . is *that* nothing .
no , do n't -- that 's something .
*go* anywhere ? of course not !
if you 're trying to be funny , homer ...
you got up ! you *did* something !
he 's *paralyzed* !
he 's *alive* . he still loves you .
what do you want me to *do* ?
please ... that 's enough .

well , *picking* them is !
i love you , too . see you tomorrow .
he *loved* it ! did n't you ?
*homer* liked it ! did n't you ?
they wanted a girl .
nobody ever wants me !
nobody 's asked for me , have they ?
nobody special enough , curly .
you mean somebody asked ?
only the right people can have you , curly .
how old are you , dear ? thirteen ?
you *bet* it 's a heavy sedation !
but what about school records ?
edna ! come dance with me !
cirrhosis -- it 's a disease of the liver .
*liver* killed him ?
*alcohol* killed him -- he drank himself to death .
but did you know him ?
barely . it hardly mattered that i knew him .
did you know your mother better ?
she 's dead now , too .
what 's a nanny do ?
she looks after other people 's children .
did you grow up around here ?
no . she was an immigrant .
what 's an immigrant ?

they would n't take me .

where are you going ?
we 're heading back to cape kenneth .
you 're a little overqualified , are n't you ?
no , i 'm not .
the only jobs are picking jobs .
i do n't *have* any time .
it 's all very normal .
*and* over the himalayas .
migrants ?
yes . they pick fruit , all kinds .
what about the trees ?
well , sure ... that 's good , then .
out back , there 's a shed .
right .
okay ...
of *course* there 's worms , homer !
you still doin ' it too fast !
and i *love* her !
you forget yourself , homer .
mr. rose , i 'm in the *doctor* business .
okay . then you can be of use .
yes , for both .
i presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery .
no . the fetus was dead .
scurvy !

i do n't follow .
big.com . that internet thing .
right .
exactly .
yes .
everything looks in order .
this has to happen fast .
i know . it wo n't go unnoticed .
there 'll be red flags .
you need some convincing . consider it a convincer .
you 're worried about recouping the loan .
no , i understand that .
the standard ten .
ten percent . of how much ?
two million .
jake ? right .

the anti-christ ?
no . i 'm not the anti-christ .
your life flashing before your eyes ?
just the last three weeks .
that 's not a bad place to start .
that was it . we had our crew .
factors that were n't clear to me until now .
we got our stake .
you 're a superstitious fucker .
luck 's a funny thing . especially the bad .
like what ?
having a gun pointed at you for one .
you know when the first con was ever played ?
bullshit ! you were scared , jake !
it 's not true .
yes it is , jake ! yes it is !
after you cut her loose .
she walked .
today ? started off great ...
probably safe in the hands of the federal government .
guess so .
so we go to the bar .
i think so .
we 'll take care of it .
fine . but only if we recover the cash .
independent . same shit , just independent .
so what ? we hide , right ?
what are you ? new ?
we sure big al threw him to us ?

we 're going to give him the money back ?
i got ta work off some of this adrenaline .
so far , masters of our own demise .
it 's alright .
let 's go , jake ?
so what ? we just stay clear of him .
jake , i mean , come on --
i told you , use less powder .
but you wo n't get that splatter effect .
that 's a lot of cash .
probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead .
i guess . i got ta drop a dime .
well , this is just fucking great ...
it gets worse .
and what about big al ?
leave him .
tonight . just me .
yes , her . where 's my wallet ?
two million .
we get fifty percent .

you ca n't cheat an honest man .
i apologize for the inconvenience .

let me repeat -- why not ?
because you killed one of my crew .

i got scared .
i can imagine .

you called the casino a cesspit .
well it is .
i despise the job .
ah , we all say that .
look , now i 'm pumping you .
now he 's a real shit .
sorry .
what are you talking about ?
i do n't know anything about it .
you 're all scumbags .
a couple i know are getting married .
what 's the blue book price ?
that 's not relevant .
how about five hundred .

how about we split the diff ... seven-fifty .
is that your idea of arithmetic ?
i 'm not a mathematician .

i do n't give a fuck about the sex .
marion . it 's a book .

without hope there 's no point to anything .
now wait a minute .
crap . it 's not relative .

no . answer it !
i hope it brings you luck .
it will .
-- i do n't care about her .
you 're entitled to your opinion .
it 's none of my business what you write .
you will ?
within a month .
you were talking in your sleep .
not talking . writing .
never . why do you ask ?
really ?
gambling 's about not facing reality .
there was a message , was n't there ?
nothing about you .
then what ?
give up being a croupier , jack .
leave me alone , marion .
you 're already alone .
i hate public transport .
what ?
i want to buy a car .
how can anyone be that naive ?
found a job ?
no .

it 's not that .
i 've set this up for you .

yes , i know that .
do n't let yourself down .
i wo n't . goodbye , dad .
you know where i 'm from ?
well , thank you anyway .
you know what ?
it 's against the rules .
that 's stupid .
there 's a casino in this hotel .
i 'm not much of a gambler really .
so why did you come to my casino ?
i was at a loose end .
no , no .
in the casino .
now there 's a coincidence .
your father ?
i loved the atmosphere .
the debts .
and the lies . gamblers are born liars .
and superstitious too . it 's like witchcraft .
that 's africa .
do you believe in astrology ?
absolutely not .
absolutely not .
toss you for it .
i do n't gamble .
just an accident . nothing .
turn left ahead .
that 's fine .
i 'll watch .
remember the guy who cheated at the table ?
you do n't like cheats , do you .
you choose .
then you 're not a pro .
what kind of trouble ?
i owe a lot of money .
was that why you did the two grand ?
i know that . but you can now .
i do n't have any money .
who 's they ?
my creditors .
the point is , they want a man inside .
and i thought you were a bright woman .
just listen .
robbery 's not criminal ?
you 're serious .
you wo n't be committing a crime .
i 've come to know you .
what 'll you do when it all goes wrong ?
it wo n't .
but if it does .
you keep the ten thousand pounds .
what ten thousand pounds ?
reynolds ? you 've done your research .
what about my neck ?
i 'm asking you , as a ... friend .

that greek guy who won at the end .
i do n't cheat , jack .
i 'm not going to report it .
so it 's mr clean .
you 're talking about complicity .
i do n't know what that means .
mostly people in the casino business .
and the girls ?
just girls . what are you drinking ?
vodka . straight . on the rocks .
good call . help yourself .
that bitch ? no .
no thanks .
do n't worry , i wo n't report you !
i do n't gamble .

it was you , you shit .
jack .
i was at beadles .
i do n't think i know that one .
do you have a salon prive ?
we tried . but there was n't enough business .
why four ? and not three or five ?
it 's the procedure here .
any exceptions ?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours .
give me 365 .
we do .
where 's the magnet ?
they 've been tested .
i do n't think so .
wipe your hands .

you wo n't . not without permission .
five .
i make it six .
five .
it 's a rule .
good call .
i said good call .
what for ?
for the database .
i do n't gamble .
ever ?
i do n't gamble , mr reynolds .
does know ? or does report ?
how ?
first offence : verbal warning .
yes .
she 's not in the gaming business is she ?
no .
fine .
that hair will have to go .
fine .
all right , mr reynolds .
he 's a good customer .
i can see .
a pleasure . pity about bella .
she was a real asset .
bruised .
take your time . two weeks .
right , that checks out here .
i 'm not sure .
yeah .
eventual supernova .
i think he 's talking to it .
key ? key ? what is the key ?
where 's the fail-safe key ?
the key !
where is it ?
i do n't have it .
christ , twenty seconds , christ !
where is the key ?
we 're gon na die , boiler .
oh , god ...
it did n't go off .
boiler , we 're alive . my heart .
doolittle , are you there ?
it 's talby .
yoo hoo , bomb ...
not much . nothing at all in this sector .
well , it is kind of a long shot ...
it 's a goddamn wild goose chase .
remember what we found ?
all right , then ...
pinback , throw me the chart log .
i read the same here .
-- open quantum latches --
can you beat that ?
talby , can you read me ?
energy shielding positive function .
swell . let 's synchronize detonation time .
all right , i have detonation time at ...
check at six minutes .
arm yourself , bomb .
well , then , everything sounds fine .
thanks .
begin main sequence . mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop .
bomb # 20 to sergeant pinback .
do you remember the detonation time ?
detonation in twenty minutes .
right , that synchronizes here .
armed .
thanks .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes .
huh ?
therefore , i shall ignore you .
hello , bomb .
false data can act only as a distraction .
hey , bomb .
the only thing which exists is myself .
bomb ?
and i saw that i was alone .
bomb , this is doolittle .
of course .
are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?
i am always receptive to suggestions .
fine .
but how do you know you exist ?
it is intuitively obvious .
intuition is no proof .
right !
this is fun .
why , that would mean ...
intriguing .
because i must detonate in seventy- five seconds .
to explode , of course .
and you can only do it once , right ?
that is correct .
hmmm ...
so if you detonate in ...
... nine seconds ...
you have no proof that it was correct data .
mafhkin oble groop ...
i 'll check it .
yes , doolittle .
your ghf reading is minus fifteen .
doolittle ...
yes .
which one ?
another unknown . not on the charts .
any planets ?
yeah . eight , it says here .
any of 'em any good ?
naah . all stable .
what ?
the new star .
who cares . do n't bother me .
commander powell is dead .
fred .
wha ?
i hereby name this star fred .
veil nebula .
who cares ?
ah , negative drop .
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- remark .
5-4-3-2-1-drop , drop , drop !
yeah , doolittle . what 's up ?
talby was in the air lock .
oh ! ah , yes , doolittle .
i like it up here .
must get lonely being up here so much .
phoenix asteroids ? never heard of 'em .
i 'm getting something here , on this readout ...
waves would be peaking really high and glassy .
... somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits ...
i wish i had my board with me now .
yes , talby , what is it ?
sh , talby , do n't bother me now .
not now !
calm down , talby . i 'm coming .
here i am .
what happened , doolittle ?
bomb must have gone off inside the ship .
doolittle ... i think it 's the phoenix asteroids !
phoenix ?
yeah ?
i really liked you too , talby .
what 's that , sir ?
what was that , doolittle ?
negative effect .
it did n't work ?
that 's correct , sir .
sorry , doolittle .
what should we do , sir ?
well , what you might try is --
doolittle , hello ?
oh , yes , doolittle , i 'm thinking .
we 're running out of time , sir .
talk to the bomb .
sir ?
phenomenology ...
yeah , the skipper always was lucky .
bruno 's girlfriend .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
but see tonight wives and girlfriends are n't invited .

no ...
i 'm on a break .
guess again .
yeah , sure , i understand .
actually , that 's not gon na be necessary .
what ?
that 's not why we 're here .
what the hell are you talkin ' about ?
i 'm outta portland .
but the boss knows i always been loyal .
he 's got exposure .
who 's camille ?
none of your business .
this wo n't hurt .
you did n't tell me you lived with her .
you know each other ?
leave . now .
can i say something in my defense ?
no .

you mean until you showed up ?
you 're not still pissed ?
justine was not an unwilling participant .
she was there ...
i live here ...
police drone .
what ? where 're we going ?
no time .
no way .
do n't look down .
it concerns only jah .
i did n't .
same old story . not interested .

which means i got ta fence it for two .
i 'll give you seventy-five bucks for it .

a long time .
a fog bank .
more like a mystery ... which is n't bad .

it 's a secret .
yeah , 'cause maybe he 's learned his lesson .
unlikely .
and because he 's my friend .
friends do n't help other friends cheat .
they 're prisoners to their genes .

they do n't have a lot of moving parts .

shit ! do not do that !
i 'm in the second containment area .
justin ?
i think i found something ...
do n't start with me , cooper .
you 're convinced the crew could still be alive ?
i 'll be all over it .
coop , where are you ...
the containment , second containment ...
hold on , coop ...
i 'll get him .
will it work ?
it worked for weir . prep the tanks .
what ?
you heard me .
you 're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix .
what ?
coffee .
no , thank you .
you were n't there . i saw it .
saw what , mr. cooper ?
i 'm telling you , i saw it ...
it is not .
you 're okay now , it 's over ...
there must be a way ! what about engineering ?
can you shut it down ?
hurry .
run !
trauma .
and this is mission specialist dr. william weir .
no time .
goddammit , dj , it was not a hallucination !
i do n't need sleep , dj .
`` another man ? '' who ?
i 've been listening to the transmission .
it gets worse .
hear what ?
`` save yourself . from hell . ''
what happened ?
weir .
oh god ...
nothing . it 's nothing .
a power drain --
you did n't hear it ?
pressure ?
90 over 50 and falling ... .
he 's crashing ...
i would n't bring you here on a hoax .
it 's the event horizon .
do n't thank me , bill .
navigation control tried to hail the vessel .
you do n't just dismiss bill weir .
what 's on your mind ?
he does n't belong on this mission .
it 's been two years since she died .
some things you do n't get over .
the dark inside me .
from the other place ...
starck !
how do you know all this ?
i built it .
we still have pressure .
that 's the second containment seal .
i 'm going in .
start the countdown .
yes , sir !
justin .
skipper , you got ta help me ...
you 're not going to die ! not today !
the crew ? could they still be alive ?
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months .
someone sent that message .
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers .
i am sorry .
clear and open on my mark .
ice crystals everywhere .
so where are they ?
starck , you still showing those readings ?
there 's no one here , skipper .
what you got , peters ?
alive ?
frozen .
... how 's the client ?
crystallized .
skipper ...
peters ...
... you okay ?
yeah . i 'm -- i 'm okay .
justin .
i 'll get back to the log .
the clock is running , dr. weir .
where has it been for the last seven years ?
that 's what we 're here to find out .
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message ...
peters and i will search the forward decks .
captain miller , the foredecks are just ahead .
negative .
they 're empty , dr. weir . moving forward .
dr. weir 's right .
one of my men is down .
what could cause them ?
it 's complicated ...
how much time do you need ?
`` insane ? ''
if it worked .
if it worked , yes .
there 's no danger .
the date .
what about it ?
exactly .
i do n't know .
you said this ship creates a gateway ...
yes ...
to what ? where did this ship go ?
i do n't know ...
where has it been for the past seven years ?
i do n't know ...
you ca n't , your orders are specific ...
you 're insane . you 've lost your mind .
maybe you 're right .
it 's done .
you ... you ca n't do that !
watch me .
i do n't need them anymore .
do you know what a singularity is , miller ?
what makes you think i 'll miss ?
then who the fuck are you ?
your fear .
you know .
then what , what are you ? tell me ...
better if i just show you .
you 're lying ... !
i 'm not asking you to believe me .
starck ... cooper ...
nooo !
locked and cocked .
what is that ?
... make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees ...
one-four degrees ...
that 's not it .
yes , sir .
dr. weir ... !
i noticed . starck , anybody home ?
where is it ?
love to .
starck , give me a read .
smith , where the hell have you been ? !
we have a situation here ...
we do n't have time to fart .
no one 's dying on my watch , smith !
they 're gone .
you heard me , smith .
understood .
that 's enough !
get outside , go back to work .
captain , we got a problem .
now what ?
alright . prep the clark for launch .
what is it , smith ?
come again , skipper ?
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor .
smith ? smith ! fuck !
let 's go .
i just finished drying ...
then what are you doing here ?
come around to three-three-four ...
radiation interference ?
keep your eyes open .
we 're all here .
okay .
but you can breathe it .
oxygen is not the problem .
carbon dioxide ?
it 's building up with every breath we take .
not acceptable .
no . it was someone else .
who ?
what is it , starck ?
... i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter .
to what ? what are you saying ?
i know that .
i 'm going outside to work on the clark .
what 's going on in there , starck ?
justin 's in the airlock .
you better hurry .
whatever was on that bridge was n't weir .
blow it up ?
we blow the corridor .
no . i 'll be right back .
... repeat , we 're armed ...
he 's dead ...
yes .
he served on the goliath .
was n't that ship destroyed ?
dj ! it 's okay . you 're okay .
they 're explosive charges .
you 're at the bridge , ms. peters .
blood . looks like arterial spray .
can you see a body ?
there 's no one here .
i did .
not according to the computer .
can you shut it down ?
keep him talking .
do you know what it was ?
come on , baby-bear , open this door ...
skipper , justin just activated the door .
it 's cold .
i do n't care .
dead ahead , 5000 meters .
she 's not ugly .
that 's the core : the gravity drive .
we 're losing atmosphere ...
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
hey !
smith 's right . neptune ?
the law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel ...
matching speed ... now .
range 3000 meters and closing .
picking up magnetic interference .
explosive decompression .
decompression would n't do that .
get them back --
i 'm trying , goddammit --
wrong . the shortest distance between two points ...
do they have pressure ?
affirmative .
ship 's log .
i do n't know .
yes .
i 'm sorry .
it wants me . i have to go .
the forward airlock .
i 'm blind , not deaf .
relax , it 's casual .
no , i mean ...
my step-dad 's . i 'm strictly into stone .
i would n't know anything about that .
i mean ...
tell me .
i 'll schedule the launch .
victor did .
would n't want to keep vic waiting .
the suit will stretch . you should try it --
i would n't be caught dead in that .
oh , he did .
what did he do to the uniform ? !
it 's not him . it 's them .
just give reed a little more time .
no , it 's not .
victor must 've taken him .
i 'm worried about you .
about me ? how sweet .
come on .
what is this ? where 's reed ?
where do you think ? with sue .
to help you .
and you can ? power it up ?
out front ? you home , baby ?
do n't come any closer for a sec .
i already got it . everything i want .
ben . this is business . just work .
ben , the money 's not important .
we got what we wanted . that 's enough .
i know , i know .
external srbs , orbital system engines .
no .
i 'm sure he 's matured since then .
i had it at four .
this makes five .
he 's made a few changes .
this is your dream , reed .
victor 's better at these things .
should ?
ben . this is serious . turn around .
three days . i was worried about you .
solid .
reed .
i should have done more , run more tests --
reed , i 'm not talking about debbie .
well maybe you should date him .
i think i need to lie down .
ben . are you okay ?
am i okay ? !
yeah , nine years straight .
o-kay . we 'll skip that question .
this is n't permanent , johnny .
oh , you remember my name do you ?
yeah . i can tell . victor was right .
got it , teach .
forget it , egghead .
yeah , well , his eyes say different .
hey , two hearts got busted last time .
put your tiny little mind at ease .
do n't you wander off , boy .
back on earth .
reed ? ... sue ?
they 're fine . everybody else ... is fine .
give me a mirror ...
go back to the drawing board .
really ? with a name like von doom ?
hey , i 'm mr . sensitivity now .
and they 're changing into ...
i do n't really know .
like the shields reed said would protect us .
i wish i could tell you .
the center for disease control .
that 's terrible news ...
so are you !
i mean , you feel a little feverish .
i 've never felt better in my life .
stay right . left is trouble .
i though we went over this .
last one down springs for room service .
not this again --
no : you 're on fire !
what about you ?

why , certainly .
you are a deeply troubled young lady ...
who 're you ?
i live here .
you 're farmer ?
what ?
i know , but i 'm not seeing it .
i need an incendiary ! an arsonist !
then show me !
your big speech ?
'how do i know it 's true ?
i already have .
the speech ? real good .
you think i got it ?
you got it .
yeah .
i 'm not hungry .
and you ... should be proud .
oh ma , they 're not using me .
yes , but important people are concerned about this .
i do n't care .
... you will .
smile , little sister , smile .
shhh , shhh .
you 're taking me home !
are you crazy ? unhand that woman !
why are these all opened ?
well , they needed immediate answers , frances .
it 's your fan mail , little sister .
you kill me , mama .

frances , you remember my lawyer , alma styles ?
what 's wrong ?
nothing .
where are you going ?
for a walk , mama . just a walk .
not long .
i 'll be back .
at one . promise ?

i promise i 'll ... i promise , mama .
i do n't want you drinking , frances .
yes , mama .
oh frances , do i have news for you !
wait , mama , wait .
mama ... ?
they want you back ! your agent called today !
i told him to come up !
you ... you selfish , selfish child .
mama , shut up !
and now you 're throwing everything away ?
i 'm going out !
you 're not going anywhere !
i have !
but what --
no ! you 're not talking now .
yes ... ?
do n't i know you ?
i do n't believe so .
sure .
oh bullshit .
thanks are hardly necessary .
aw , shucks , ma'am .
so it seems .
why , doctor ! we 've only just met !
you may discuss my predicament , doctor .
normal . average .
all right . will you please sit down now ?
... did you really say that ?
just a little joke , miss farmer .
this whole thing is a joke !
stay calm , please .
no , you stay calm , doctor !
oh , that 's good , very professional .
you did n't say 'symington says ' .
yes . it was very good to see her .
really ? any problems ?
no ... what i mean is ...
and you accused her of tampering with your mail .
oh for christ 's ...
huh ?
no , i 'm warning you !
sedate her .
good ! because , brothers , that 's you !
i checked the files .
you 're kidding .
yeah , well , you know doctors .
what ?
'incurable . '
yes .
i was watching .
what is that to you ?
i am as he made me .
you drove him to his torment .
and he drove me to mine .
then why weep for him ?
would you not ? he was father .
what kindness ?
build for him a pyre .
the music ? or the fire ?
why ?
i 'm ... very , very ugly .
it ca n't be as bad as that .
worse .
yes . i have been seeking my friends .
friends ? do they live around here ?
yes . very close
why do you not go to them ?
i am afraid .
you speak .
yes , i speak . and read .
how did you find me ?
kill me and have done with it .
kill you ? hardly that .
then why am i here ?
more to the point , why am i here ?
fine words from a child killer .
your crime ... as well as mine .
how dare you . you 're disgusting and evil .
evil ? do you believe in evil ?
i see it before me .
i 'm not sure i believe .
materials . nothing more .
you 're wrong .
trace memories in the brain , perhaps .
stolen memories . stolen and hazy .
i do n't know .
then perhaps i believe in evil after all .
there is something i want . a friend .
friend ?
a companion . a female .
like you ?
we 'd travel north , my bride and i .
yes . i want this over and done with .
i 'll be waiting . and watching .
her body pleases me .
a brain . extremities .
this was not taken from a grave .
what does it matter ? she 'll live again .
no . i draw the line .
i will not ! kill me now !
that is mild compared to what will come .
she 's not for you .
i 'm sure the lady knows her own mind .
she 'll never be yours !
there , there ... shhh ...
quite right !
scandalous ! what would your dear mother say ?
one-two-three , one-two-three , twirl- two-three ...
and you look so lovely .
it 's been months .
something 's wrong . i know it .
i should go . i should leave today .
elizabeth .
and not a word of them to father .
fine .
is he not back yet ?
are n't you ?
nothing can . not ever .
she was mother to me as well .
god took her from us .
he left a beautiful gift in her place .
the world is a dizzying place .
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies !
quite a send-off , is n't it ?
father 's so proud .
and you ?
prouder still .
i 'll have to do better than that .
you will . what do you want , victor ?
to be the best there ever was .
all my life i 've known .
is that what makes it so delicious ?
i wish to be your husband .
i wish to be your wife .
then come with me to ingolstadt .
if only i could .
only you .
i will be here when you return .
not as weak as i .
your decision . for us .
i give you my soul ...
... until our wedding night .
victor . i love you ,
elizabeth . my more than sister .
i 've no choice
i know only that he is a killer .
i 'm all right . i 'm safe ,
it 's not something i can explain now .
what of our marriage ?
so do i .
it was misguided and pointless .
it is
victor , tell me why ! trust me !
i do .
now husband and wife .
i have been waiting for this ever since .
open this door for no-one !
it would n't dare .
they knew the risks when they signed on .
this ice will break yet .
he died . raving about phantoms .
aye , captain .
i 'm convinced .
no . but someday .
thank goodness . we 'd be out of work .
oh god .
very well then .
as a march hare .
of course i am .
victor , victor frankenstein .
i know .
come now . magnus ? agrippa ?
can you think of a better reason ?
quite a few .
you 're a comfort to me , henry .
what now ?
it 's a letter to my father .
these are exciting times , henry .
somebody has to !
nothing in moderation , clerval .
good .
it was wrong , henry !
why waldman ?
you ca n't . death is god 's will !
i resent god 's monopoly .
that 's blasphemy !
blasphemy be damned !
there are sick people who need our help .
i 've been preoccupied .
that is my concern .
how much longer ?
few months perhaps .
things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak .
yes ? and ?
listen to what i 'm saying .
a ... week ?
we feared cholera .
mine and professor krempe 's .
you 've been going round-the-clock ?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can .
everything in moderation , clerval .
nothing in moderation , frankenstein .
no . they do n't .
victor . this place looked like a charnel house .
thank you , henry .
for what ?
this . my home . my family .
i did n't find what i was looking for .
yes , do n't worry .
only if you 'll tell me who he is .
i owe you that . done .
let it go .
so you have claimed .
i have no knowledge of that .
or albertus magnus . cornelius agrippa ...
what is your name ?
victor frankenstein , sir . of geneva .
of geneva .
victor , explain yourself .
krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
you have a way of provoking his .
to say the least .
it 's utterly fantastic !
why ? god alone knows what it means .
but the possibilities . combining ancient knowledge with new ?
it is a thrilling direction to explore .
i doubt that decision is still mine to make .
nonsense .
our profession needs talent like yours .
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system ?
the strain was evident .
oh , now you have gone too far .
i 'm ... dying .
are you a physician ?
how is it you come to be here ?
there 's a startling question , coming from you .
would-be .
i ca n't say i blame them .
you know of it ?
your men are right to be afraid .
then explain it , whatever it is .
lives are ephemeral .
madness ?
my name is frankenstein ...
jack ? marcie ? ned ?
no , no , they 're all dead ...
bill -- bill -- bill is out there ...
i will protect you .
maybe we should wait for mr. christy .
i do n't know .
tomorrow is another day .

i was careless .
give them a little while longer .
i guess ...
good night , brenda .

oh , thanks .
just a feeling . nothing personal .

i do n't know .

un-hunh .

colonel hamilton .
do n't lie to me , hamilton !
sir , arnold is a traitor .
no one knows ...

oh , come now ...
you invented this , this ...
if he is n't , then he 's stupid .
general lee is detained captain ...
detained by what ?
the british army , sir !
unofficially , general greene .
what 's the difference ?
what can he do ?
george ! so good to be back !
a ground swell-christian movement , george , you see ?
no .

my god , what ?

everything .
you 're no fool , george .

it 's an anti-christian dogma !
oh , indeed ?
do n't condescend to me !

i want you to see our hospital .
i do n't want to see your hospital .

how long to fix ?
hard to say .
turbine rotor 's shot .
i thought you said it was just a blade .
metal 's crystallized .
how much longer 's that gon na take ?

warm water current maybe , making the metal expand .
bullshit .

could be meant as a warning .
so whoever did this might still be around .
do what you need to do .
right .
murphy .
you better get down here quick , skipper .

i think you better see this for yourself .
not me .
if they knew what they were carrying .
how do you mean ?
for starters , getting that gold off the ship .
with all due respect , skipper .
i do n't know what you 're talking about ?
i think you know .
maybe you can tell me then .
the radio . oh , yeah , the radio .

you better get down here right now !
turbine chamber on number two must 've blown !
right .
there 's a charming thought .
sorry .
do n't fall asleep .
right .
maybe twenty gallons an hour .
too big . more like a freighter .
cargo like this could make a crew think twice .
probably did n't have time .
that 's what i call a payday .
hell yeah .
hell , yeah . i like it cold .
maybe six feet . lanky .
you 're a pal .
because of the gold .

headache , nausea , lights ?

no . i 'll try again later .
possibly false .
what ?
somebody took it out of commission last night .
but , who -- ?
the same day she supposedly went down .
must not 've been the captain 's entry .
collision ? with what ?
the page 's missing .
but where 's the damage ?
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
if it was a ship she hit .
does n't matter .
hey .
could n't sleep .
wish i could say the same .
never mind . before your time .
i do n't know , are we ?
not our mystery guest again .
no . someone else . a girl .
showing you what ?

that much i think we 've already established .
more than just a mutiny .
i do n't know .
epps , over .
either of you seen dodge ?
right here .
leave him till we can get some help .
could be a stroke . who knows ?
over the gold .
maybe it was more than that .
crazy with greed . not crazy .
we hit land .
what ?
we 're in an island chain .
so you killed them ?
i think i see it pretty well .
it 's the ship .
i wish i could believe that .
go .
of course they did .
let the buyer beware .
what do you say , dodge ?
you got that right .
better than `` making hamburger for mickey d . ''
red sky in morning , sailor take warning .
alright . i 'll be right up .

how 's that ?
besides a little rust , everything 's pretty well-preserved .

yeah .
you 're up late .
guess i must 've fallen back to sleep .
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
ho , baby !
dodge , you got ta get on those repairs .
we could call for help .
moving to sweden .
let 's just take it easy here , alright ?
supposing he wants to get bad with us ?
we 'll have to take it easy then .
and look what happened .
drink up then .
lost my sea legs .

`` hassle '' ?

still torturing yourself over that enid , huh ?
yeah , well ... thanks for cheering me up .
no problem .
i wish i could see him .
yeah .
call me sometime .
i am .
talk to us about it ...
it 's a tampon in a teacup ...
right , exactly !
no ... they said she was here ...
what the fuck is she doing ? !
uh , do you mind if i wait ?
are you sure she was n't there ?
why would she be hiding from me ?
josh ! ? why would she be with josh ?
i do n't know .
why ? what did she tell you ?
i have no idea - i just want to ...
why would n't she tell me ?
yeah , she thinks you 're a dork .
did she say that ?
look , what do you expect ?
what do you mean ?
on that pathetic fake blind date .
what are you talking about ?
did n't she ever tell you about that ?
what fake blind date ?
do n't thank me .
yes ?
do you have a check for me ?
-malaria epidemic ; very sudden .
let me see the sick .
oh , you 're a doctor now , too ?
there is no reason for fear .
on that i choose to remain dubious .
as are they all .
am i to take it you want to live ?
most certainly . absolutely . yes .
excellent decision . your name is abdullah ?
i think it 's been a pleasure .
how ; we do n't know where they are ?
i 'm sure you 've examined my record .
but i have in india- every country presents problems .
you 'll need your confidence , i promise you .
how could it be ? i hate africa .
do n't they , though ?
so work must be going well ?
starling ?
yes he is .
well , i need to speak to him .
what have they done besides kill starling ?
in point of fact , it did n't .
-not a time for modesty , bob-
who else would hire me ?
you do n't enjoy killing , do you ?
then why do it ?
you never had it .
nigel and i do n't like each other much .
-please- you need n't be so graphic-
you intend `` sorting this out '' tonight ?
we have hunted since childhood .
all right- you 'll spend your nights inside .
that .
just that they fart through their mouths .
almost three hours .
we all have our reasons .
have you got that in writing ?
i 've got medical supplies to deliver .
and anxious to get started .
we know three things about man-eaters .
might be exciting for you .
i 've never been all that adventurous .
i 'd love the company .
well , why not ?
shhh .
so that 's what a lion looks like .
are n't we full of ourselves today ?
possibly .
nigel , you 'll just have to use your hands-
that 's what the books say ...
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night .
you mean nobody died ?
we all worked together . worthy deeds were accomplished .
what did i do ?
got me out of trouble .
nonsense- samuel would have done something .
we need to talk .
actually , no .
all right- let 's go into battle .
somehow i guessed .
i 'm always considerate- my mother taught me that .
i can try .
samuel says you killed a lion .
has it ever done that before ?
... do n't know ...
have you ever failed ?
only in life ...
it 's all right . stay ready .
but of course yours worked .
what happened to them ?
i got big .
nobody 's seen anything like this .
do n't they have to be ? ...
yes .
i 'll have to .
good luck .
why ?
because i think they 're after you .
the most of any lions ... a hundred ... ?
because they are here .
get on ? they detest each other .
this is more difficult-
clearly you do n't agree about building the railroad ?
you- they can not believe you 're still here .
nonsense .
fine . get started .
look out , samuel , here it comes .
thank you , samuel .
good news ?
i expect so- it 's from my wife .
do you love her ?
i do , actually ; very much .
you give me hope , john .
i have to ask- why do you need me ?
oh yes . but it takes time .
you 've known him long ?
since his beard was red .
he does n't . he needs nobody .
i feel the same about the bridge .
once ...
underneath . somewhere .
it 's all right , samuel- we all get hit-
four should do it .
they will want a lot of money .
not even close . what happened ?
and where will you sleep beautifully ?
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas .
help finish the railroad .
some mysteries should not have solutions .
hold your son high .
actually , i 'm not eating lunch today .
i 'm sorry . perhaps some other time .
okay , i 'll take a raincheck on that .
hello , dana .
no , everything 's fine . honestly .
okay , just thought i 'd check .
good night , janosz .
no harm will come to the child .
not in this case , my dear .
i do n't care who he is .
i know .
i 'd rather not .
i 'm not saying you did .
oh no .
do you ever see him ?
occasionally
how is he these days ?
venkman ?
does he ever mention me ?
no . not that i can recall .
certainly .
thank you .
you 're also a human being , frank .
okay , okay .
thank you , frank .
did n't i do it ?
okay , that 's no problem .
that 's exactly what you said last week .
i have .
there 's no doubt about it .
his name is oscar .
oscar ! you poor kid !
peter , this is serious .
i 'll supervise .
okay , let 's take a look .
you are personally responsible .
do n't worry about me .
good luck .
thanks .
oh , hello , peter .
you 're really good , you know .
i did n't paint it .
peter , the bathtub tried to eat oscar .
i do n't know what to do anymore .
peter , what about the bathtub ?
we 'll take care of that .
thank you . poor baby .
i 'll put him down for you .
yes , i 'm very clean .
now you get dressed and we go out .
i 'm not here to date .
does she know anything about babies ?
janine melnitz , are you kidding ?
okay , but it 's not a date .
i have a hamper ?
oh , peter , i did n't dump you .
why do you say things like that ?
thank you .
do n't worry .
finally came to your senses , huh ?
same difference .
so what ? it 's a free country .
no problem .
hi , egon .
a little to the left . right there !
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else .
i received this information from an alien .
i 'm an old friend of the mayor 's .
i know who you are , doctor venkman .
it 's that darn ghost again !
do n't worry . we 're not moving .
ghostbusters .
what are you doing up here ?
i was trying to get that smelly green thing .
that 's very practical .
oh , sure , that sounds great .
tonight ?
i do n't think we should leave her alone .
you 're right . we should stay .
oh , yeah , sure -- no .
how are you ?
my pleasure .
i know .
then why have you come ?
the upper west side .
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio .
i 'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory .
oh , johnny .
yes , the scourge --
-- the sorrow of moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
i command you .
i await the word of vigo .
who are they ?
they 're the scoleri brothers .
maybe they just want to appeal .
you 've got to stop them . please !
okay , let me rephrase that question .
yes .
get on with it , counselor !
did i forget something ?
i ca n't do it , louis .
why ca n't you just have them released ?
i 'm a dermatologist .
i got you out of those bad tax shelters .
you were the one who got me in .
then you should go to the police .
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster .
i let them handle all the little stuff .
objection . irrelevant and immaterial .
so what are you saying ?
hello , venkman .
how 've you been ? how 's teaching ?
yeah , you would .
i knew that .
you need the exercise .
it 's a rough translation from the moldavian .
this wo n't wait until tomorrow , venkman .
they love you , lib . keep it up .
i 'm worried .
they came from ostrov in eastern poland .
ostrov ? i 've been there .
some crank . looking for goat hooves .
this one 's interesting .
why do n't we try the giga-meter ?
his nickname is `` the hammer . ''
and we 're the ...
that 's it . it 's on the bottom .
nine feet -- ten --
butt out , you pencil-necked geek .
do it ! just do it !
no , the slime is rising .
and it 's all flowing toward the museum .
there 's something very familiar about this painting .
so , no goat hooves , huh ?
i knew that voice sounded familiar .
nowhere -- fast .
oh , just checking something for an old friend .
who ?
who ? just -- someone we know .
oh , ray --
aaah ! nobody ! i ca n't tell you !
who , ray ?
dana ! dana barrett !
it 's an interesting one , pete .
okay , let 's heat 'em up !
i 'm peter --
this is an incredible breakthrough , venkman .
nothing .
i 'll get one more reading .
darn it !
okay , but you 're missing all the fun .
yeah , sorry i missed it .
i hate jello .
she 's new in town .
me ? i 'm a little of everything .
i 'm ready .
then let 's do it .
come on , winston .
yeah , what did we do , ray ?
huh ? what ?
you finished here ?
what ? yeah .
are you all right ?
no , i 'm fine .
no , i just thought --
well do n't think !
yeah , i guess so .
do n't you see ? it 's the slime .
and decent .
wonder what ?
if she 's naked under that toga .
it 's okay .
miss blue blood ?
i do n't know .
well , thanks a lot .
nice going , honey . it was brand new .
i did n't break your precious clock , roy !
to the bathroom , where do you think ?
have i done the right thing ?
uuuuuuugh ! !
what 's the matter , dear ?
it is a star ! that 's great .
ummm -- figure eight ?
incredible ! five for five .
well , you 're doing great .
definitely .
i was just going to say `` eight . ''
hi , louis .
... i thought it was the drug store .
are you sick , louis ?
no thanks , louis . i 'm really tired .
okay . i 'll take a raincheck .
i thought i turned it off .
hi , louis .
hey , it 's crazy in here .
fine , louis .
i got the twister game for later ...
i am zuul .
i 'm innocent ! honest , dana .
all right , what happened to me ?
yes ... well ... i 'm not sure .
barrett . dana barrett .
so what do you think it was ?
some people like the attention .
it 's in the stars .
really ? do you have a favorite piece ?
i 'd have to say prokofiev 's third concerto .
that 's a violin concerto .
no ? what do i act like ?
like a used car salesman .
thanks . what 's in there ?
what ?
nothing . is that the kitchen ?
well , let 's check it out .
i 'll wait here if you do n't mind .
i told you , i ...
i know . it happened by itself .
are you all right ?
yeah , yeah .
i think i should spend the night here .
that 's it . get out .
on a purely scientific basis .
out !
i want to help you .
i 'll scream .
do n't scream .
then leave .
okay , okay .
okay . then i 'll go .
goodbye .
no kiss ?
you heard it ?
you 're the best one in your row .
i do n't have to take abuse from you .
the `` stiff ? ''
you must have gotten the last copy .
hittites , the mesopotamians and the sumerians .
what 's he doing in my refrigerator .
i 'm checking on that .
i 'll pick you up at your place .
i am zuul . i am the gatekeeper .
okay , i 'll help you .
he is the destructor .
really ? ca n't wait to meet him .
i do n't know .
right ... you 're the gatekeeper .
there is no dana . i am zuul .
whoa ! ! nice voice .
thank you .
talk to my accountant .
this is preposterous ! i demand an explanation .
fine .
he 's a big one .
yes .
thank you for coming .
back off , man ! i 'm a scientist !
we 'll get back to you .
that 's very fascinating to me .
is that a game ?
it 's a great game !
i collect spores , molds and fungus .
oh , that 's very - unusual .
i think it 's the food of the future .
remind me not to go to lunch with you .
die in what sense ?
in the physical sense .
i do n't care .
what is it ?
i do n't believe in luck .
keep it anyway .
thank you .
what calls ?
here are tonight 's calls .
i did n't ask him .
did you ever report it to anyone ?
heavens , no !
i 'm walter peck .
great ! how 's it going ?
are you peter venkman ?
yes , i 'm doctor venkman .
i see . and now you catch ghosts ?
you could say that .
and may i see this storage facility ?
no , you may not .
and why not , mr. venkman ?
because you did n't say the magic word .
and what is the magic word , mr. venkman ?
the magic word is `` please . ''
why do you want to see it ?
well , because i 'm curious .
hey ! make yourself useful !
that 's `` peck ! ''
a square ?
good guess -- but no .
close -- but definitely wrong .
yes . i do n't like this .
well , just 75 more to go .
two wavy lines ?
sorry . this is n't your day .
you volunteered , did n't you ?
then my theory was correct .
they 're not guns . they 're particle throwers .
yeah , yeah .
i could n't do that .
were you recently in the bathroom ?
what on earth gave you that idea ?
what have you got , egon ?
oh , this is big , peter .
wow !
did n't see anything , did n't get anything .
yeah , i can smell it .
what ?
do n't cross the beams .
why not ?
trust me . it will be bad .
what do you mean `` bad ? ''
what is it ?
i do n't think so .
some . i just met the keymaster .
yeah , yeah . i was just thinking .
you have to keep him there .
oh , shit !
let me guess -- gozer worshippers .
yes .
who ?
gozer .
you talked to gozer ?
get a grip on yourself , egon .
full-stream with strogon pulse .
no ! them ! shoot them !
life is just a state of mind .
but it 's my favorite state .
we 'd better adjust our streams .
god , it 's ugly !
easy ... easy ...
neutronize . system shut .
i need two new purge valves .
the storage facility blew .
sure . that 's great , ray .
no , this one 's for real , peter .
what do you mean by `` seen ? ''
looked at with your eyes .
what do we do now ?
i do n't know . talk to it .
what do i say ?
anything ! just make contact .
hey , lady ? lady ! can you talk ?
okay . okay . i got it .
i guess i got a little overexcited .
oh , yeah .
do you know what a patent clerk makes ?
to go into business for ourselves .
but at nineteen percent interest !
this might do ...
do you think it 's wide enough ?
fourteen hundred .
good idea .
it was n't a date .
do you know when that might be ?
no sense worrying about it now .
sure .
where are you , pete ?
third floor . get down here ,
sit tight . i 'm on my way .
well , hurry up .
do n't move . it wo n't hurt you .
how do you know ?
i do n't know . i 'm just guessing .
i ca n't take much more of this .
he 's listed on the blueprints as i. shandor .
forget the trapping ! just blast him !
what ? what popped in there ?
look !
the stay-puft marshmallow man !
great !
mmmhmmm .
me , too .
boy ! solid cores of shielded selenium .325 .
do you believe in god ?
no . but i liked jesus ' style .
me , too .
right . and the sky would fall ...
judgement day ...
yeah , judgement day .
later , man ! !
what do you mean `` choose ? ''
we 're nearly there , lucilla .
that 's what you told me two days ago !
will you please get back in your wagon ?
i 'm tired of being stuck in that wagon .
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed .
why ?
i 'm sure , i do n't know .
if i may be so bold ...
for the gods , spit it out !
why not do it in the colosseum ?
you ca n't do that !
you 're coming back ?
i have to come back .
taking my pleasure .
what is that ... wailing ?
the fans of narcissus .
now that we 're done with that infatuation forever .
`` ... by the emperor of rome .
not yet , dear brother ...
send them out !
respectfully caesar , quintus and i must report .
of course , but not now .
perhaps , master galen , you may say .
gladly caesar .
or perhaps into a new one .
do we really need to repair this fort ?
that this illness has clouded his mind .
apparently my opinion was n't needed .
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate .
ignore that ? !
at least stay for the running of the animals .
until your confirmation date .
maybe it 'll crush gaius .
i 'm serious .
so am i .
we can crush gaius another way .
give away food ?
sacks of grain , even bread .
make a gift to the people .
he left us at dawn .
underdog !
where is the emperor and the army , soldier ?
he must have been .
jerses -- tomorrow ...
this is cos , this precocious young man .
i do n't know ...
agh ! please !
i 'll nose around ...
you know there were riots last night .
that 's their job , is n't it ?
that makes his birth sign ... virgo !
yes , because i know they 'll read it .
god of passages and changes ?
but have never been ?
we all know what right is , senator .
i hope you live to see what i believe ...
you 're hearing about somebody else .
you do n't know how wrong you are .
my loyalties ... were in doubt .
they ca n't ... if this is rome ...
without him .
why do you play at being drunk ?
how do you know i am playing ?
i do n't believe that .
would that marcus had lived .
narcissus , i have your family .
hidden .

goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
just one favor .
money ? there 's plenty of that .

he 's afraid of you , harold .
what kind of a country has this become ?
blue soup ?

do you really need this bed , lady ?
uh-huh .
got her mother 's looks .
her mother 's dead .
julia 's my second wife .
lucky man .
damn right .
it 's just a puzzle box .
cenobites . explorers in the further regions of experience .
you solved the box . we came .
no !
no tears please .
you did this before , right ?
many times .
to a man called frank cotton ?
he did . i 've seen him .
i could lead you right to him .
no . that was n't the deal .
stay the fuck away from me .
you can keep them .
i have to speak to my father .
that 's easily arranged .
it 's important .
you took quite a beating .
first things first .
i do n't remember .
oh christ .
kirsty ?
no .
you remember .
no .
come to daddy .
what ? what will you do ?
this is n't happening .
i used to tell myself that .
one last time . give me the box .
you want it ?
this is n't happening .
some things have to be endured ...
do n't mourn him .
poor baby .
bastard .
hush now .
frank --
that 's right .
that 's right . who are you ?
i 'm brother frank .
oh .
i came for the wedding .
oh . oh yes .
well can i come in or not ?
i 'm sorry . of course .
i do n't want to see the dress .
but you said --
i do n't want to see the dress .
forget him .
i 'm very happy .
sure you are .
oh my god .
do n't look at me .
who are you ?
i said : do n't look .
tell me who you are .
frank .
believe me . it 's me .
what happened to you ?
his blood ... on the floor ...
back from where ?
just help , will you ?
ssh !
what do you want me to do .
the blood brought me this far .
hurting .
my nerves ... are beginning to work again .
good .
one more . maybe two --
the cenobites .
keep your voice down .
you 're hurting .
you wo n't cheat me will you ?
better . very much better .
later .
what ?
i want an explanation first .
not know .
tell me , damn you .
you promised me an explanation .
a box ?
it 's not any box .
let me see .
do n't touch it . it 's dangerous .
what kind of doors ?
to experience beyond anything ever known .
hell ...
i was bored . i 'd done everything .
and you came back here to solve the puzzle --
sure . somewhere safe . safe . christ !
who did ?
the cenobites . the creatures the box set free .
you 're still afraid .
you would be . they tore me apart .
so you were cheated .
no . they gave me experiences beyond the limits .
yes . they 'll never find us .
i do n't .
so where 's the harm ?
i said no .
i do n't think so .
that 's probably her now . or the police .
maybe .
do n't you care ?
there 's very little i can do about it .
maybe we should just leave --
like this ? look at me ! like this ?
well we ca n't just stay here --
i need a skin . then we leave --
hi . i got soaked .
there 's a towel in the bathroom .
which is where ?
just to your left .
just an accident . he 's all right .
sure .
the keys are in the kitchen .
where 's daddy ?
what 's the problem ?
i have to see my father .
of course . there 's no need to shout .
i was here this afternoon .
this afternoon .
i saw everything .
i 'm sorry , i do n't follow .
oh my god .
we 're going to freeze to death .
o.k . o.k .

just a thought --
ah !
it 's just been empty a while .
the best part of ten years .
i do n't know . probably wanted a hideaway .
we 'll sell it . sell everything .
i thought half of it was your brother 's ?
he wo n't complain .
you mean we 're moving in ?
no . i 'm not .
you wanted to come back to london .

i try not to drink at lunch-time .

what 's wrong ?
too much drink . better empty my bladder .

really ?
it 's like she 's waiting for something .
what ?
i do n't know . i do n't know .

of course .
whatever frank did was his error .

he 's gone .

give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours .
but you must have --
i must have nothing . their my husband 's .

i 'm vince .
whatever .
what 's the name of your label ?
how old is richard ?
p.d .
find the father . that should clear things up .
he 'd want to know about all this .
mr. congeniality ? let him find his own clues .
uncle joey 's little girl .
sure .
go to hell .
this one came unassembled .
fine .
figured you knew more about swords than i did .
claymore .
huh ?
scottish claymore .
it 's in good condition .
you 're very macabre .
it 's my birthday .
happy birthday .
thanks .
no thank you , i 'm fine .
why ?
then you did n't know richard later on .
no .
i do n't follow you .
poor little tyke did n't have a chance .
the boy _died_ ?
mother too . sad case it was .
there was this one fella .
carl smith .
you owe me . besides , i 'm cute .
yes .
very traditional .
it 's not mine .
basil the ii .
charming guy , basil .
good day , miss cartwright .
probably .
who ?
people like that rarely leave business cards .
does carl smith ?
i think you do .
i 've been to church hill .
i doubt that . good day , miss cartwright .
you 'll be safe here .
why not ?
tradition .
what the hell is going on ?
where ?
dupont circle .
at the moment ? carl smith .
and you ?
you need n't worry miss cartwright .
he called you `` macleod '' .
not your concern .
i left a man dead in felton .
that bothers you ?
he was innocent .
he 's dead .
you ?
i 'm a witness to a murder .
no .
why not ?
you are being foolish .
i 'm a historian , mr. taupin .
are you ?
no one knows you 're here ?
no . i had to talk to you .
you had to do _nothing_ !
you 're wrong .
you 're a fool .
maybe .
you 've been listening to rumors .
our cars were seen together in felton .
you are . now .
richard taupin has become cumbersome .
not all of them .
when you finish , what then ?
you want me to front for you .
yes .
i wish i could .
yes .
well , as long as we 're stuck here .
there 's a catch .
a little dusty .
follow me .
yes .
and you are william taupin , are n't you ?
yes .
no .
at least .
that 's impossible .
i hope i never get that old .
you wo n't .
i see .
i 'm not even sure why .
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer .
you are a very perceptive young woman .
just a little crazy .
that would be difficult to explain .
i 'd like you to try .
that 's why smith called you macleod .
yes .
he knows about you .
he is older than i .
perhaps . there is something more . an inheritance .
of bodies .
i did n't kill the watchman .
you killed those other two .
not the same .
what about that family in '31 ?
sometimes innocents become involved .
you kill with your left hand ?
i have n't killed _you_ .
is that a threat ?
come here , brenna .
damn you .
empty . and fear .
it 's all the same .
what is it you want ?
all of it finished .
will i see you again ?
be careful .
i ca n't stand it .
i 'm the last .
no !
i 'll destroy you .
the inheritance .
not power . not control .
i 'm just curious .
you 're never `` just curious '' .
now there 's a new topic .
call your mother . you never call her .
you better have a warrant .
what do you want from me ?
you and i should talk first .
we 've got nothing to say .
all fashionably without heads .
spare me the details .
but there 's more .
you 've been a busy little beaver .
you 're an asshole , moran .
i want taupin .
what makes you so sure he 's the one ?
just for laughs we raided wonder boy 's house .
research .
do n't be stupid , lady .
it 's that important ?
yeah .
some job . card filing and cabinet dusting .
it 's bullshit . everything .
not who . what .
why ?
he 's too cool . too sharp .
you see that desk ? _your_ desk ?
give it a rest ned , huh ?
what are you doing man ?
-et lux perpetua-
you 'll not be bringing the church into this .
-luceat ei-
-auditorium nostrum-
stop .
-in nomine sanctus esperitu-
stop !
your name is conor ?
aye .
juan cid romirez . chief surveyor and alchemist .
you 're not from these parts .
i am from spain .
i was nearly killed .
but you lived .
first food , no ?
pheasant .
you scots have a way with game .
why are you here ?
it was time for our paths to cross .
does it change with me in the room ?
it is less .
you feel you know me .
i do n't know why .
we are brothers .
you are still so very young .
i 'm twenty-two .
not even a single lifetime .
we are immortal .
no !
this is madness !
it is the truth .
no !
this ca n't be .
you are not dead , boy . accept it .
this is monstrous .
you 'd have to die first . aqui .
then they were right . i am evil .
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .
oh my god .
it is always less with my living .
there is an imperfection .
how can i stop such a man ?
hide .
why ?
we are brothers .
me arm hurts .
again . try again .
go to hell .
muy bien !
it 's like to kill me first .
point conceeded , mr. macleod .

the game 's over . you lost .
it 's me you want . not her .
no . as usual you 're wrong .
you 're groping . i have been fair .
i 'll give you anything you want . anything !
do n't beg , peter .
no ! wait ! !
very good . how did you know ?
the pipes .
you do n't understand .
yes , i do . i found your file .
they took away the game because of him .
i think your mother knows that now .
of course not .
okay .
set up some pieces on the big board ?
never mind . he died two years ago .
1985 . hans korshaud .
he 's in his seventies and lives in holland .
new york . 1986 . viktor yurilivich .
what scars ?
the scars on your chest .
you 're damn right !
you could have been honest with me for starters .
i admit i handled it badly .
fuck off !
i just ca n't believe it .
you do n't want to believe it .
you 're safe . he would n't come here .
he already did once .
why did he what ?
come here .
he was watching you .
uh huh .
i 'm kathy .
he went down to the lobby for a minute .
boys .
of course .
how do you know that ?
no ... but i can tell .
nice meeting you .
my cheering section .
i ca n't sleep . my beds lumpy .
i see .
you want to sleep in my bed tonight ?
okay .
mrs. lutz .
nothing .
for what ?
but you promised .
who 's kathy ?
not much .
how long has she been dead ?
six , eight hours tops .
any sign of rape ?
not that i can see .
bingo .
not much .
no prints .
you mean , no prints but hers ?
no frank . no prints .
not a drop .
wait , i 've saved the best for last .
yeah .
how long she been dead ?
i 'd say at least eighteen hours .
well what ?
what did dr. fulton tell you ?
we 're not sure .
what do you think he did ?
it 's important .
-- edmonds . i know .
it could have been a tape .
yes .
i was thinking the same thing .
call dispatch . double the patrols .
this ai n't no photo .
it ca n't be a coincidence .
he moves around a lot . why ?
that 's a big area to cover .
yes .
about a quarter to one .
what are you saying ?
what does that mean ?
this stinks !
you do n't have a shred of evidence !
no .
ten days ago .
do you know how she found the apartment ?
through a rental agency .
only in passing . to say hello to .
here . i played gregory lutz .
i know .
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow .
i got it from the tournament directory .
we 've already met . have n't we ...
that 's alright .
`` wee willie winkie runs though the street . ''
`` is '' .
how can he be playing chess with you ?
maybe i already have .
a building ?
a building is n't as light as air .
are we going to go through this again ?
answer the question .
i went out .
maybe he just got tired of covering for you .
this is insane !
i signed the confession . what about the car ?
it 's over , peter .
he knows you 're aware of that .
then i 'll transpose .
our computer went on the fritz again .
is it serious ?
i want to be the best i can .
just thought you might want to talk .
about what ?
whatever 's on your mind .
who says something 's on my mind .
mate in five .
exactly ... and you did this .
no .
feel like practicing ?
yeah . just let me grab a shower .
hi , sara . this is doctor sheppard .
thank you . i 'm at 639-7393 .
we 'll call you back .
sara , this is doctor sheppard .
yes , doctor sheppard .
could you please do me a big favor ?
of course . yes , here it is .
what are they , please ?
`` carefully '' . `` carefully '' .
it 's alright .
yes .
how come you do n't stay with them ?
no . i do n't .
uh huh .
are you one of the players ?
yes .
when i was very young .
it seems like such a complicated game .
not really .
chess is a reflection of life .
that 's a very personal question .
i see .
are you disappointed that i wo n't answer you ?
do you always open quickly ?
are we talking about me , or chess ?
you .
each circumstance requires a different tactic .
getting too hot in here for you ?
nothing . i just came in for a steam .
no you did n't .
did you think it was going to be easy ?
i ca n't right now .
she could be dead after the game .
she could be dead now .
what if she is n't ?
i do n't think i could .
you sound like my mother .
it was n't intentional .
does what 's going on bother you at all ?
another kind of game ?
in a way .
this is n't a game .
oh , but it is .
how can you look at it so clinically ?
take your average cop .
what about you ?
do you ?
let 's change the subject .
okay . so , tell me about yourself .
that 's not fair !
why ?
because i work with them .
you 're not ?
no -- i 'm not involved .
how could you ? unless you were there .
you know , andy thinks you 're doing this .
does n't that scare you ?
no .
why ?
because i think he 's wrong .
no . but i 'm open to distractions .
i 'm sure you are .
was n't i just talking about me ?
no . you were talking about chess .
alright . what about me ?
i dunno . where 's erica mother ?
she died in a car accident .
i 'm sorry .
it 's alright .
it must 've been very hard on erica ?
it was .
and you ?
yes you are . you 're playing word games .
what is this ?
what are you talking about ?
does anyone ?
then show me who you are .
no .
call room service .
what do you want on it ?
you .
would you settle for pepperoni ?
if i have to .
the line was busy . i 'll try again .
i thought you said the line was busy ?
i tried again and got through .
what 's wrong ?
nothing .
then why are you backing up ?
-- admit what ?
how could you think that , kathy ?
exactly . it 's the key .
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine ?
where 's the note ?
can i come in ?
no , listen .
you do n't understand .
then help me to understand .
it 's not that easy .
of course it is n't .
why ?
because she killed herself ! !
why not ?
because i know what it says .
maybe you 're afraid of what it says .
it 's got to be grammatically correct .
frank told me .
no he did n't .
he did n't tell you either .
are you going to come tonight ?
yeah . i 'll be there later .
i got lucky .
i 'm sure you are .
no , i want you to do good .
i 'm not nervous .
me too .
last night was the worst .
you 're really not bad looking . almost handsome .
well , you 're beautiful .
< u > what < /u > ?
we 're almost married .
thank you , but i can wait .
i ca n't .
about what ?
i ca n't wait either .
colwyn .
no .
in a great fortress in the mountains . wait .
colwyn ...
where is the fortress ?
i do n't know .
i will find you .
i know it .
i love you , lyssa , i love you ...
colwyn . colwyn . i love you , colwyn .
you must move away from the center .
all the passages are guarded .
i do n't know how .
you have the power .
all directions are the same here .
move quickly . we are coming for you .
i knew you would come .
come quickly , colwyn .
that way . i can feel the cold .
yes .
it was a platonic kiss , father .
of course it was .
you ca n't reach her ! through the door .
i wo n't leave you here .
you will do as i tell you .
does the queen live ?
the new queen lives .
turold 's son was to marry her .
we were married .
your powers are greater than you know .
in the old books .
there is no other way .
but there is another entrance to this place .
you have rope ?
i am too old to climb down a rope .
you wo n't have to .
reach out farther . call to her .
lyssa ... lyssa ...
it is the fortress of krull .
yes .
you have not slept in two days .
yes .
what do you see ?
darkness . tunnels and corridors . wait .
she is too deep .
< u > why < /u > ?
i 'm not sure .
but you suspect .
you will know , in good time .
there is no other way .
he has come for lyssa .
lyssa ? < u > why < /u > ?
like you , she has extraordinary powers .
can she be forced ?
no .
never .
you are young .
he thinks you betray him with lyssa . colwyn !
the beast will kill her .
yes . to keep her from you .
lyssa , your bracelets .
where the spiral begins .
i chose the wrong passage .
she can see the beast !
use your sword .
what use is my sword ?
cut . < u > cut < /u > !
you 're coming with us .
it is my fate to die in the fortress .
no ! you can not know that !
i can . because i choose it .
i forbid you !
we must enter the swamp .
what will happen ?
you have done it ?
i road them often in my youth .
saddles .
yes . it is today .
each to his fate .
perhaps you think no man would return to me .
i do n't think that .
yes .
am i not beautiful enough to be loved ?
yes .
even by you ?
yes .
i ache with it .
let me comfort you .
i can not take comfort when she has none .
then give me comfort . sleep with me tonight .
i can not betray my bride .
one night is no betrayal .
i can not .
i doubt it .
it could have been quicksand !
a forest near the valley of needles .
blast ! a thousand miles off course .
perhaps he expected to eat it .
staying alive .
he saved our lives .
my < u > friend < /u > .
i have need of friends .
no more , my lord - my friend .
< u > what < /u > ?
what else is left for a man without friends .
smart as well as quick .
fame .
fame ? thank you , no .
how did you know i had sons ?
i know you .
to the place where death lives .
it should be an interesting journey , then .
that i promise you .
i 'm all right .
why do they burn the villages ?
not sleepy , either ?
no .
those are not child 's tear .
i knew you would not be .
we must try to get horses .
yes . it will double our range .
these we 'll pay for .
hand over your dinner .
a flicker of talent .
what kind of friend do you think i am ?
the best .
yes , my lord .
those beasts can not be saddled by mortal men .
at the gallop !
naturally .
colwyn , do n't be a fool .
there 's no way to outrun it .
would you settle for a boar ?
a < u > boar < /u > ?
me . may i eat with you tonight ?
the swamp of betrayal .
i 'm glad . i 'm very glad .

the forest is not safe these days .
< u > me < /u > ?

the widow of the web ?
yes .
that creature helps no one .

power you have given me .
knowledge .
of what ?
the fortress of krull .
why must you know ?

but maybe it is --
how do you figure ?
no , she ca n't move for an hour .
and you know this for a fact ?
i never trust a woman who 's not blonde .

she was a delta gamma !
maybe she found him like that .
of course , i do !
has warner huntington checked in yet ?

i have something far more pleasant awaiting me .
nay .
purely a precaution ...
always .
we go out , smash 'em now ?
no . smashing is not required .
indeed , the best of fun ... enjoy yourselves .
this is another victory , my friends .
to finish last evening 's delightful work .
what do you want with me ?
your love .
your words sting more sharply than your whip .
but i 'm hideous !
you 're magnificent .
grotesque ... monstrous ...
on the contrary !
not from me , surely ...
you ... you 're a beast !
we 're all of us beasts , my dear .
and you ... are you not also afraid ?
i am afraid of nothing .
then why hide behind a mask ?
protection ?
i am a creature of darkness .
to be my bride , of course .
i 'd soon die .
we 're both of us damned , my beauty .
no . now is the time for discipline .
why should i kill you ?
do n't please ...
what do you want from me ?
at the moment , very little .
oh , yes ...
yes ?
what will become of me then ?
i do n't expect you 'd understand .
it 's nothing .
it sounded like it came from the courtyard .
from the parapets most likely .
pleasure is for those who seize it !
now i want to live forever .
or looked so beautiful ...
yes . i feel that , too .
precisely , my darling .
what ? speakee loud ! no hear velly good .

the flower . bluebells .
it looks ... er , delicious ...
are ye afraid of me wine ?
he is afraid of enchantment !
big question that , lad . why what ?
why has this happened to the world ?
aye .
course we care .
there must be an answer somewhere .
true ...
jenny greenteeth ? who 's she ?
think there be truth only in beauty , lad ?
aye .
aye .
what do i do ?
do n't get caught , that 's what !
fie on what she thinks !
aye . black baron 's mischief .
if the horn be restored the curse is ended .
time for a champion .
and who might that be ?
no less a creature than the lindfarne worm .
there 's the spirit , lad .
no false modesty , lad .
screwball ! you dolt !
something 's coming .
it would appear so .
careful , lad .
the colt 's still too small .
aye ! that too .
you 'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart .
i 'll drop a cow on the knave !
track the demon to his lair .
aye .
whatever for ?
i 'm sure . it spoke to me .
birds speak to me all the time .
beware .
sounds like the bird we want .
good plan that .
blackheart ?
aye . he 's enchanted the lot of them .
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
the foulest . mayhap i can cut them free .
jack , do n't !
what know you of fields of war ?
beyond devil 's needle , all is unknown .
jack , jack , it 's dwarves live here .
nay .
better to kill than be disturbed .
something the matter ?
ogg 's footprints !
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet .
certainly understandable .
very secretive , they are .
gump , you 're putting words in my mouth .
stoutly spoke , lad .
we 're not in a tournament , gump .
god protect you , honeythorn gump .
be gentle with them , jack .
there 's the way , mates .
it bodes evil .
willful creature , that one ...
stay on your guard , jack .
long as we do n't lose heart , jack ...
we 'll never find the baron 's castle .
nay . this time we strike first !
nay .
i know the rogue , jack .
no ... but what choice have we ?
the chill is worse this night .
it feels wrong , jack ... like a trap .
we do both .
easily spoken ...
do n't loose heart ... assemble the archers .
there are n't enough arrows .
never mind . just do it !
and frog do n't fly and bite like tomcats .
been telling you that all along , lad .
what magic have we on our side ?
that 's it !
aye . before the wee pesties attacked .
then it 's godspeed , screwball .
fire away !
best get down close to the moat , lad .
aye . we 're good as inside .
it 's what we 'll find there worries me .
it does n't matter .
nonsense ! course it matters .
... the princess lili ... i 've killed her .
nay .
easily ...
the alicorn , lad . come to your senses !
because sunlight will kill him .
sunlight , you say ?
aye . hurry now , gump , the key !
mean you to seek him out below ?
i 'm not afraid of the dark .
i admire your valor , jack .
sunlight .
plan on carrying some away in a kettle ?
easier than that , jack . screwball !
patience , lad .
ah , but you will .
tis a delicate operation , lad .
hurry up !
never show mercy !
i could have struck off his head just now !
he 'll not escape me .
i 've not heard a note out of you .
not in the mood , i 'm afraid .
listen to him . not in the mood ...
where 's your joy if you can not sing ?
tis not the wound , that 's sure .
might not need a gesture quite so grand .
where ?
by the pond . she was teasing me .
go on ... go on ...
and did you ?
nay . it was lost .
i 'll try .
hush up , screwball .
no , no , no ... this is different !
screwball ! be quiet ... !
gon na make ogre-stew !
three cheers for our champion .
very thrifty . even got your arrow back .
they 've fired the moat !
they 'll do nicely .
sorry .
if you like .
never .
but you did ... you did !
i may have said perhaps ...
liar !
or perchance ...
the baron is a frightful man .
oh , fie . what about the unicorn ?
unicorn ?
a promise is a sacred oath .
all right . i 'll show you something sacred .
stop complaining .
a gentleman would offer water .
only were he a fool to boot .
i detest serpents .
that viper has envenomed the water .
what shall we do ?
be patient .
what 's the matter ?
i 've lost my napkin .
do n't leave me now .
the napkin will keep .
your command is my wish , princess lili .
shhh !
i am a princess .
in these woods you are a commoner .
oh jack , might n't i touch one ?
are you honest ?
jack !
tis a fair question .
not if you be chaste .
i 've no fear of failure .
to fetch your napkin .
i do n't know .
who ?
my father and the baron .
damned hunters .
they tricked you .
my own father ...
how bad was the unicorn 's wound ?
it happened so fast .
he did run ?
oh , yes , and the mare with him .
good . they 'll never catch him .
its powers are strong .
my lady mocks me .
let it .
be it fit for your wife , green jack ?
i have no wife .
then , perchance you 'll me .
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride .
do you wish it , jack ?
what if i answer yes ?
jack ... forgive me ...
only what 's right ...
i was bewitched ... it 's better this way ...
they told me you were dead .
you 've freed me , jack ...
it 's the baron 's damnable work !
sunlight ... it destroys him .
sunlight ?
that 's why he goes masked during the day ...
so , he 's hiding in the dark ...
in the dark ... where i join him ...
no !
and i ... love you ...
whilst you were sleeping , i fetched your ring .
you 're teasing still .
but ... i am a green man .
lili ... i love you !
and i love you , my husband .
ouch ! something 's biting me .
biting you ?
pinching me !
pinching ? where ?
everywhere ! ow !
i ca n't see a thing .
nor can i . damn !
ow ! whatever it is , it hurts .
grand champion , is it ?
we seek the ogre , baron couer de noir .
his feet shall never cross my lips .
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross .
i like well your conceit , jack .
why then , there thou hast .
ask away , sweet man .
what became of the princess ?
princess ? i know of no princess .
princess lili , godwin 's daughter .
exceeding fair .
as fair as me ?
no !
dead , dead , dead .
i do n't believe you .
you 'll visit again ?
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom .
i pray god grants it me .
sorry .
i 'd be honored .
only that ?
and charmed , of course .
fie ! do n't speak of charms .
i had no thought of offending you , oona .
do i not please you , jack ?
in every way .
and am i not fair ?
wondrously so .
jest with me then .
how so ?
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind .
a faerie 's love makes anything possible .
i 'm promised to another !
what shape i take matters not .
please ...
why should i feel such pain ?
you beware , jack !
heading north still ?
i know where to find him ...
we wait .
i think she 's about to foal .
watch behind or i 'll never collect on it !
small miracles better than no miracles ...
of course they 're alive .
up ahead !
bah ! you faeries have the morals of ferrets .
or a kite ... !
done like a champion .
it 's done ... we 'll never catch him .
no speeches !
i slew the lindfarne worm with it .
achilles wore it before the gates of troy .
you 're well equipped , i 'd say .
may god protect you .
to castle couer de noir ?
nay .
you 've been inside ?
in a dream .
do n't speak to me of dreams !
what are you doing ?
i 'm not cheating ! i 'm not looking !
he was there and then he was n't !
we did a lot of the wiring too .
with dale .
i thought i might stop by .

i 'll survive .
he seems lonely .

i might not stay , anyway .
i 'll get your back .

i wanted him to marry her .

it 's freakish . i do n't get it .
what are you talking about ?
josh said ...
i 'm not gay .
you 're driving me crazy !
you 're off , you know ?
i thought i was helping you .
it would help me if i could kiss you .

are you afraid of heights ?
not if what he left me was real .
he asked where you were !
i do n't wan na go .
floating to catalina .

will he talk to me ?
no .
it could have been a squirt gun .
you 've been good this week .
we 've known each other since grade school .
george just never really ... aimed that high .
i 've been dreading you .
oh , yes .
and if i enclosed it ?
an exhaust system or a window is code .

allowed outside the enclosed area .
i flushed it down the toilet .
it 's thirty feet .
months .
what are you on ?
pardon me ?
how much weight have you lost ?
oh ... nothing . thirty pounds .

you were the only neighbor i could tolerate .
i did warn you .
my life is a warning .
and you thought they might be under her dress ?
where are you ?
i do n't know .
i know what the deal is .
you do n't know what the deal is .

i 'm not even listening .
you know that great thing , though ?

i like how it feels not to feel .
how do you become something you 're not ?
what would you like to be ?
what i 'm not .
what are you now ?
nothing .
that 's not true .
what do you know about me ?
i 'm telling you now .
i gave up on you .
getting high , i guess .
if i asked you to stop , would you ?
i have n't used anything for two days .
i 'm proud of you , sam .
do n't be .
i was just thinking about my mom .
sun glasses ?
to hide a black eye .
why would n't she leave ?
everything would have been better if you had .
do you ever wish you had done it ?
after everything he did to you and your mom ?
after everything .
that 's so weird ...
what 's wrong with your back ?
are you taking them still ?
no , but i count them .
the kind where there is n't really an answer .
i still do n't know what that means .
the kind where there is n't really an answer .
i still do n't know what that means .

kurt 's been feeding him .
but you ca n't call me while you think ?
i was n't thinking .

i ca n't pick you up .
you bit my finger .
if i were n't married ?
i need to know .

monsieur .
may i ask how much your rooms are ?

i think i need my glasses .
do n't worry ... there will be enough .
i must be stern with you .
but , comrades ...
shall we tell her ?
we have opened a restaurant ...
the duchess ...

but you had !
i think so too .
so it 's love which drags you to moscow .

me ?

gladly .
how long do we have to wait here ?

you 're welcome .
you might hold this for me .

bad manners to point with your own ...
and where are we ?
i 'll try .

and thank you for getting me up here .
yes , it is .
i 'm glad i saw it before becoming extinct .
do not misunderstand me .
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles ...
well , let 's say i live in it .
then you do n't want me to go there .
i will do my best .
yes .
good evening , comrade .
he takes good care of that .
he looks sad . do you whip him ?
we take off our hat and coat .
is that customary ?
it helps .
not too big and not too small .

and what is your profession ?
and what do you do for mankind ?
thank you . thank you .
ni-notchka .

just what you see .
it 's twelve o'clock .
it 's midnight .
that 's the way a clock works .
it 's false sentimentality .
you analyze everything out of existence .
no , that was restful . again .
oh , my barbaric ninotchka .
the telephone is ringing .
oh , let it ring .
ninotchka , or shall i say special envoy yakushova ...

it is out of the question .
you know i want to ...
then do it through my lawyer !
ninotchka , you ca n't walk out like this ...
i did n't follow you .
then how did you get here ?
i always eat here .
this is a place for workmen .
what are you after ?
must one always be after something ?
your tactics are useless .
what ?
will you smile ?
why ?
just smile .
at what ?
at anything .
because we are an odd couple .
then you should go back to your table .
no , i ca n't leave you .
that 's not a laugh !
well , er ... let 's drop it .
do you like scotch stories ?
i have never heard one .
i wish they had never met .
so do i .
no .
i do n't think so .
maybe you have n't any sense of humor .
no .
so you do n't think that 's funny ?
yes .
foolish ?
i 've never been here before .
for twelve francs , seventy-five .
twelve seventy-five from the clarence ?
a wonderful idea ! radio or records ?
not radio .

i do n't think so .

a very wise suggestion , leon .
no thanks , swana .
did i act stupidly last night ?
i 'm the one who should apologize .
oh , no , my little volga boatman .
and i thought it was something serious !
it must be serious , swana .
say it over and over again , leon .
i 'm afraid that 's what it is .
the same old trouble , leon .
what is this , swana ?
she 's gone , leon .
do you expect me to believe that ?
hello .
dear me ... i must be losing my finesse .
what ?
of course not , my dear !
please come to the point .
now there you are completely wrong .
that 's all right ... i grow on people .
i must ask you to leave .
leave ?
madame , if you ...
do n't worry . i have already made reservations .
believe me , leon ca n't help you .
do n't worry .
you leave me no choice .
unfortunately .
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state .
my lawyer agrees with you .
no , i just wanted to be absolutely impartial .
go on .
what do you want ?
may i have your bags , madame ?
why ?
good morning , comrade commissar .
you mean you have finished the whole investigation ?
yes .

it gives details which could n't be invented .
yes ... leaving immediately .
how can i make myself clear ...
please do n't waste my time , comrade .
i will do my best .
this will do .
raw carrots and beets .
oh , madame !
but , madame !
that also is a question of food , madame .
can you recommend a restaurant ?
at père mathieu 's .
where is that ?
it 's just a place for workmen .
where is it ?
eight blocks down in the rue de poivrel .
how do you do , my friend .
your highness , forgive this intrusion , but ...
what is it , rakonin ?
alexis ! do you know what you are saying ?
this morning three soviet agents arrived .
thank you so much , my friend .
then tell richardson to fire him .
you did say it , sir .
never . i never said that about jews !
you do n't need to check the tape .
where the hell is he ?
then his office will be fine .
frankly , sir , it stinks .
we 'll see about that ...
he 's nervous , sir .
that 's helms .
`` ex-cia '' ?
then what about this washington post crap ?
son of a bitch .
what ?
hunt has nothing to lose now .
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here .
uh huh ...
we could get a million dollars .
i agree it 's ridiculous but --
no , we have nothing to hide .
we have nothing to hide .
i understand that , sir .
good . you know how i feel about loyalty .
yes ... i got the money .
is it ?
to protect his people .
i 'm one of his people .
anyway , they had to take her to bellevue .
yeah , i knew it .
you do it .
why me ?
'cause he hates you .
i figured that out .
i think he means the kennedy assassination .
yeah ?
they went after castro .
christ , we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans .
dick nixon saying `` i 'm sorry '' ?
so you tell mitchell ...
mitchell 's out of his mind now .
jesus ! through a window ?
mitchell ?
no ! magruder !
is it legal ?
sure .
in hiding .
and ?
he wants money .
pay him .
pay him ?
what the hell are you doing , ehrlichman ?
no , sir .
is the war worth it ?
no ...
i thought the gloves were off .
sir , there 's dead american kids here .
yeah , good old spiro .
well , no place where they speak english .
no , no .
my point exactly !
forget it .
and what am i supposed to do ?
it 's marked .
... go on .
mr. hoover was a realist .
i trusted mitchell .
at least mitchell stood up to it .
there 's no secrets here , al .
damn right .
'night , al .
that 's what they 're doing .
let 'em try !
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena ?
who the fuck does cox think he is ?
for what ? !
a dozen ? i got half of 'em elected .
cox ! fire him .
but he works for the attorney general .
the hell he will ! fire him , too .
sir , the deadline is today .
can we get around this , al ?
lincoln used it .
that was civil war .
how do you see this ?
i know it well , sir .
it came over from vietnam , you know .
sir ?
that smell .
it was just a fishing expedition .
their fourth !
that fruitcake ! what about him ?
definitely .
yes , you approved it , sir .
i did ?
it was right after the pentagon papers broke .
fucking hell .
we were working on china .
our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks ?
silence !
how about a comint classification ?
`` national priority . ''
we 'll work on it .
no , keep trini out of this .
all right .
play it tough .
just do what i say , bob .
he 'll need a pretext .
how is this national security ?
because the president says it is .
yes , sir .
he would n't do the makeup .
the bastard !
no !
what ? that he knew johnny roselli ?
yeah , but roselli was n't just any gangster .
chile , congo , guatemala , cuba .
he did n't veto it .
and not just hunt .
so ? you wanted castro dead .
because ... because dick helms knows too much ...
you never told him ?
i did n't want him to get the credit .
money . follow the money .
sir ?
these kids are being manipulated by the communists .
i tell you , the soldiers were provoked .
run 'em over .
it 's the parents ' fault really .
what ?
... `` the beast . '' a nineteen-year-old kid .
... but even the presidency is n't enough anymore ...
sir ?
the presidency wo n't protect us , bob .
this could be it ... this could be it .
we ought to fire his whining ass .
right . they do n't trust !
why would they ? !
we could leverage helms .
how ?
when i met with him , he said ...
he 'll give us the documents .
put townsend in belgium ; it 's available .
townsend gave us 300 grand .
no ...
why me ?
i expect more from thee , richard .
then this shall be our little secret .
is it my turn ?
thou must .
it 's meant to make us stronger .
what about happiness , mother ?
what do you think ?
what 'd you say ?
i said i did n't need a free ride .
go to law school .
harold ... can i get you anything ?
and so shall i .
i 'm not jack kennedy .
not if i give you all the cards ...
and of course i accept . i 'm flattered .
what ?
mr. castro .
yes .
cia policy ?
so president kennedy thought .
flowers are continual reminders of our mortality .
no . they make me sick .
no .
black irishman . very moving .
he 's lying , clyde . always has .
edgar , think twice .
not joaquin , you idiot . nixon .
would you walk with me down to the paddock ?
if things remain as they are ...
turn this crap off , clyde .
winning ?
how about you ? are you going to win ?
you should ask bobby .
i 'm trying to spare you an embarrassment .
yes . your old friend from cuba .
i never met the man .
i know you 've been very careful not to .
it could be '60 all over again , edgar .
that was a mistake .
who do you think is behind it ?
kissinger ?
he 's obsessed with his own image .
yeah , you do .
injections . even this noble sport 's been fixed .
they 're around .
the white house .
you 're fucking me .
we 're gon na be plumbers , frank .
who we working for ?

her name 's sandy ...
only if kennedy dumps johnson .
that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow .
it 's me or wallace , jack .
it 's nobody 's fault , jack .
what do you mean , jack ?
presidents do n't threaten .
i beg your pardon --
finally someone who 's noticed !
what i think is ... they 're cowards .
exactly , yes , mr. president .
mr. president , this can not be breathed !
idiotic ? yes , i suppose it was .
oh god , i 'm going to throw up .
they will understand , sir .
do n't be stupid .
do you ever pray ?
uh ... not really .
yes .
not at all .
secret , mr. chairman ?
how a fat man gets so many girls .
just ... uh ... you know .
of course .
yes , mr. president .
we let you down , did n't we .
that was mr. kennedy .
you do n't think he was a hero ?
did you cry when he died ?
yes .
why ?
i do n't know .
how did he do that ?
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war .
the real war is in us .
how about kissinger along with him ?
kissinger 's misunderstood .
hiss was protecting his wife .
you mean smashed !
it 's a thing she does .
talks all day , too !
that 'll be the day .
four . two boys . two girls .
jesus christ !
how do you know that , john ?
it was n't your fault .
they were throwing rocks , john , just rocks .
that was a long time ago .
you all know me .
... but it was all we had .
mr. nixon .
... any information you have , edgar .
you 're shittin ' me .
where you from ?
syracuse .

he tried . it did n't take .
yes , sir .
yes ... ... father .
you know how old i am .
god help us all when you 're forty .
i did n't see any .

pride is his weakness .
we 're low on salt .
or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause .

you 'll see before long . let 's go .
is there quicksand ?
ayuh .
just do n't stop , louis .
you keep saying that .
this time i mean it .
whose burying ground ?
the micmac indians .
why ? for god 's sake , why ?
i had my reasons , louis .
i guess so ... but ...
you want to rest a bit before you start ?
no , i 'm okay .
soil 's thin , all right .
your cairn .
do n't worry about that .
jud , why am i doing all this ?
because it 's right .
no buts ! accept what 's done , louis .
would n't wash ?
no . i 'm a doctor .
ayuh .
i guess it would n't hurt .
wendigo ?
spirit of the north country .
why , then , things should be fine .
a little upset is all she was ?
ellie 's a little scared of death .
well ... a touch of the flu ...
this babe has said enough .
it 's ellie 's cat .
nope . he 's your cat now .
louis --
ayuh -- it 's a mess , all right .
because something called a wendigo soured the ground .
and because the dead walked .
the door must not be opened .
leave me alone !
remember .
you do n't understand --
louis , the house is beautiful .
come on -- let 's parole 'em .
jesus , the road !
yes -- thanks . i 'm louis creed .
yes -- i know . this path , louis ?
i do n't have the slightest idea .
it 's beautiful !
extraordinarily morbid , maybe .
she was a little over-excited , that 's all .
it was that place .
i just said --
i know what you just said .
and church will be fine .
do n't shilly-shally , louis .
oh , you 're welcome .
i got eggs down here !
good d --
i thought maybe you did .
not by me , it is n't .

i 'm sure .
anamaria ! have you seen gibbs ?

that boat is my livelihood !

they 'll be anchored on the lee side .
aye , aye , sir !
she . goes . free .
elizabeth goes free !

and jack . and the crew .
eh ?

simple .
the pearl ? oh , that 's fine .
you give me the pearl .
i 'm supposed to ... trust you ?
wait as long as you like .
track you down and --
that fool woman took it .
bosun !
now , jack .
that 's fair .
all right then .
because , right about now , the h.m.s .
that so ?
aye .
aye , for us there is .
remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
now . no , do n't kill him .
and he 's got old bill 's courage .
i guess there is a reason to fret .
no . but him i believe .
i want you to leave .
very well .
my holds are bursting with swag .
because it 's what you 're searching for .
elizabeth -- turner .
thank you , sir .
of course .
it 's you who invoked the parlay !
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner ?
now , none of that . please dig in .
would that i could .
it 's a pirate medallion .
aye .
boy overboard !
fetch a hook -- haul him out of there !
i ca n't breathe .
i 'm a bit nervous , myself --
commodore , you ca n't do that !
you 're speaking up for him again ?
your father is frantic with worry .
commodore , please !
what ?
i know where your heart truly lies .
that would hardly be proper .
and that 's what concerns me .
yes -- yes .
captain norrington 's promotion ceremony .
about the day we met . do you remember ?
parlay ! i invoke the right of parlay !
truthfully -- you were a bit late .
to keep it away from them ?
-- then we never would have met .
-- but that was not a proper kiss .
miss swann , if you 'll be so kind ?
me !
you 're in league with barbossa !
no , i 'm -- rescuing you .
no . this wo n't work .
it wo n't .
welcome to the caribbean , love .
you 're right .
what ? what was that ?
nothing ... it 's nothing . just ...
oh , no ... it 's silly .
now i must hear this song .
mr. sparrow !
to the black pearl .
nor did you , i noticed .
oh , there 's a hard tale , jack .
i 'm going after the black pearl .
a fool 's errand .
not if the fool has something barbossa wants .
and you 've got that , have you ?
she can hold a bit longer .
i know . that was for the smell .
ah -- he 's learned , then .
we 're not going to just surrender !
that we are .
i do n't think that will be necessary .
we 'll see about that .
sorry , i did n't know .
smith .
indeed .
funny , i was thinking along those lines .
they left me stranded . twice .
you threatened miss swann .
only a little .
i do . and i practice with them .
you need to find yourself a girl .
pirate .
no .
move !
no .
somewhat .
where does it make berth ?
surely you 've heard the stories ?
why ask me ?
because you 're a pirate .
and you want to turn pirate yourself ?
never . they took miss swann .
so it is that you found a girl .
how ? the key 's run off .
i helped build these cells .
agreed !
we need to go !
my business , will .
good .
no worries there .
commandeer . we 're going to commandeer a ship .
it 's still against the law .
so 's breaking a man out of jail .
remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
aye ! avast !
my father . william turner ?
good man . good pirate .
i swear , you look just like him .
it 's not true my father was a pirate .
figured you would n't want to hear it .
he was a merchant marine !
my father -- was not -- a pirate !
you did n't beat me .
oh -- did i forget to mention that ?
do n't worry .
these are the only ones worth having .
the pistol .
barbossa .
depends .
on what ?
on whether the stories are all true .
this way !
i 'll lead them away .
are you sure ?
jack !
do n't talk . these caves magnify sound .
it 's the right way .
the worst .
no , it 's not .
yes it is . i 've seen it .
you 've seen it ?
yes .
you 've seen the black pearl ?
yes .
you have n't seen it .
yes , i have .
no .
but i 've seen a ship with black sails .
... no .
and no lies !
he 's not telling the truth .
he may be .
still --
where did he come from ?
an explosion in the powder magazine .
no . she has n't .
a moment .
but --
please .
until he 's done .
you got it , dr. argon .
dr . bright has escaped .
no .
dr. argon , i demand an explanation .
no .
come with me , susan .
no , thank you .
does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb ?
do you know what i see ?
do ?
wow , that is one moving story .
ai n't it .
you mean besides kicking your ass ? !
that 's right .
you 're not rotting meat .
it 's ready now , i know it is .
she says it 's not .
she 's lying .
she did not .
who cares ! we 've got to find him !
oh no . no .
nebbleman .
eventually .
and you think o'brien is that leverage ?
that remains to be seen .
she must feel something for him .
why are there two ottomans ?
icarus , please ! this is important !
yes . yes , of course it is .
then you still love me ?
oh yes , icky . i can feel it .
i 'm so excited , icarus .
considering what ?
what i asked you earlier ?
if you loved me like i loved you ?
poppy , this is not the time !
did i ?
not that .
the nanobot is gone .
poppy , order the trucks from the gary plant .
the trunk .
excellent .
thank you , sir .
you do n't want this .
yeah , i do !
i want trix ! mommy !
so what ? so what ?
haw-haw !
what are you going to do ?
i 'll do whatever i have to do .
aaabout ... ?
this morning .
yeah .
what did he want ?
i 'm not sure .
that 's right . c.d.c .
that 's the guy ?
they 'll in validate the key . probably nothing .
well , you got another problem .
the replicators ?
worse . mrs. argon wants to talk to you .
this day just keeps going from bad to worse .
what i 've always done .
you 're looking for a urine sample .
dr. argon would say we are all prisoners .
argon is a lunatic !
because i am a new man , susan .
is that what argon told you ?
no ! well , not those exact words .
who is n't ?
it 's sim . we 're almost there .
mr. sim , watch out !
smell ? uh , something like methylcyanoacrylate .
like crazy glue ?
yes . that 's it .
so , i guess it worked .
wellie well , dr . bright .
what ? no kiss ?
been out for six months now .
really ? what have you been doing ?
you know , this and that .
same old daniel .
oh no . not by a long shot .
oh yeah .
the big house ?
the big house .
jesus , daniel .
right . you predicted it .
that 's what i thought .
yeah , we 'll see .
we 'll see ? what does that mean ?
i ca n't help it , suze .
am i ? look ! right there !
susan , this is the future of america here .
daniel , what are you doing here ?
please , susan ! i need help !
the nanobot .
mouse ? what mouse ?
my first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse .
what happened to it ?
i do n't know .
daniel !
i 'm a plastic man ! a plastic man !
we do n't ?
mostly caffeine diuretics .
why ?
the nanobot is still inside you .
the problem is the by-product created by the process .
the waste .
three days ago it was .
what do these replicators do to people ?
is n't it already too late then ?
no , why ?
no , no , i just feel wired !
what ? what 's wrong ?
what about it !
means ? oh no .
just giving credit where credit is due .
you have no one to blame but yourself .
blame the victim .
victim my ass !
yeah . old times .
probably the caffeine .
do you have something to bring me down ?
no problem .
daniel , i did n't hear you come down ...
the nanobot ... it 's not here ...
it 's still inside me ?
i do n't know .
something else i want to try .
no cheese .
i was hoping you were over that .
getting used to it .
like a glove .
sort of .
on the counter .
the head shrinker at the prison .
you 're not going back to jail .
you did n't think i could just leave you ?
i did n't know what was going to happen .
where is it ?
argon 's private lab .
let 's go .
i 'm not leaving without you , susan !
did you think i could just leave you ... ?
you do n't have to say anything , daniel .
oh shit , the meltdown .
we 've got to get the nanobot .
it 's too late . argon injected it .
you mean he 's polymerized , like me ?
yes .
we do n't have time to argue , susan .
i have to !
i remember i was trying to help ...
god , what a fight that was .
we were different people then .
do you suppose that was our problem ?
i guess they do .
i 'm real touched .
oh yes you are !
i get it .
forget it , pissboy !
an ass-beating .
oh yeah ?
it 's a miracle .
mr. sim ? do you have him ?
oh yeah , he 's alive . technically .
and you have him ?
we lost him .
can i help you , mrs. argon ?
is that a threat , dr . bright ?
you wo n't .
get him , daniel ! knock his block off !
pipe down , brain lady ! and you ...
to make a gentleman out of a tramp ?
exactly .
yes - is n't it .
goodbye , miss gallagher .

i think you should , miss gallagher .
i do n't mind her if you do n't .

you 're all right .
yeah , that was considerate of me .
i 'm not interested in your literary recommendations .
just a moment .
i 'm not interested .
no - give you another guess .
so , it 's obvious , huh ?

for what ?
for the letters , of course .
you 're a peculiar person .

ok .
so ... did my brother call you ?
no .
i have no idea what he 's doing then .
it 's fine .
it 's remarkable , doctor .
no one 's forcing you to listen .
then what 's he doing here ?
now give the signal .
yes , abbe ?
but why must you indulge in his pornography ?
why not act the role of heroines instead ?
`` turn you out ? ''
by whom ? the marquis ?
mother 's not half so blind as you .
they incite us to act .
what ? what 've i done ?
must n't do that , sir .
i must grant him his last rites .
it 's not even noon --
but you implored me to write !
but you 've no right to publish !
have you truly read the book in question ?
and -- ?
it 's not even a proper novel !
and such puny scope !
it 's a fiction , not a moral treatise .
but is n't that the duty of art ?
they ca n't be serious .
our future lies in the stroke of your pen .
mightier than the sword indeed .
put yourself in my place .
fuck 'em ! they 're half-wits and pinheads .
honestly ! you cut me to the core !
how can one man possibly be so selfish ?
whores and pederasts ?
you always do .
madeleine .
you 're tense , darling .
good day , marquis .
then bugger me !
his rug .
orvolle . his wine .
-- and your meat shall be de-boned .
because your writing continues , unchecked .
its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares !
morbid gratification ? no !
a night spent with the partner of my choice .
you expect me to pimp madeleine ?
i was n't talking about madeleine .
coulmier , you animal !
i do not mean to flirt , marquis !
oh , but you must , my pumpkin !
now strip .
your wig . remove your wig .
for fuck 's sake , abbe !
an innocent child is dead .
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
i know , because i felt it myself --
i wanted to fuck her , that 's all !
and did you ?
it 's not your province to ask .
go to hell !
why was it you never took her by force ?
who 's to say i did not ?
was it impotence ?
never !
then it must 've been love --
we inspected the body , marquis .
tomorrow , we 'll cut out your tongue .
i 'm here .
surely you 'll grant me a final word .
of course .
it 's a formality ; truly .
playing dress-up with cretins ?
his wife 's ?
a man of his notoriety ?
well ... ?
for sale ? to the general public ?
have you tried bleeding him with leeches ?
why ?
a practical man , sir .
charenton is my life 's work .
he 's sworn to obedience .
i have .
of course .
it was not inspired by circumstance .
no . it most certainly was not .
that 's not our intent --
do more .
madeleine 's not wicked .
and my own .
how is the patient faring ?
poorly .
and you ? it must 've been an ordeal .
will you sleep soundly tonight ?
no , sir .
of course , your highness .
maybe someday you 'll tell me your name .
sweet , then ? like the pastry ?
stop , i beg you !
was ever a man more risquè ?
come now , darling , give it a read .
`` well worth the dig ! ''
do n't start --
go ahead ; you 've a key .
you ? frighten me ?
i put myself at life and limb .
most assuredly .
is it terribly erotic ?
fiendishly so .
what 's that then ?
it 's only been described to me .
go on , child .
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet !
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined !
`` what shall i ready ? '' asked fanchon .
tell him i 'm no fool .
i pray you : be succinct .
you 're new to charenton , yes ?
what a beautiful thought , marquise .
what thought is that ?
-- words alone are insufficient .
it 's beyond perversity .
now is the time to secure your epitaph .
and i in yours .
if only you 'd remained true to our contract !
am i a cursed woman , doctor ?
it 's libelous ; you would n't dare .
and why not ? my fortune , siphoned away .
... .shame on you , truly ...
forgive me , i beg you --
how was i to tell you ?
to flaunt your deviance in public ?
he refuses to be seen in my company !
but it 's just begun --
do as i say .
very much .
you prefer a book to your husband 's company ?
no , when i was but a tender lad --
last week would this be ?
not you too
it 's gon na be fine , orson .
i wonder sometimes .
you 're just scared .
am i ?
oh , but have n't you heard ?
carole , you wound me !
you need to get outta here , rapunzel
with about twenty of his spies on my tail .
yeah , orson 's a real piece of work .
and attractive in a hammy sort of way .
mm .
i can't
sure you can , just --
he needs me here .
and he did .
yeah . but all of a sudden it 's not
you know this citizen kane picture ?
uh-huh
but i am that 's the killer , honey .
my name is orson welles
the actor
and director .
i see .
to make pictures .
so i 've been told .
do you ?
intimately .
so where does that leave us , mr. welles ?
randolph !
hope you do n't mind my popping in --
over at rko ?
uh-hub .
yeah
oh , why is that ?
why is that , louis ?
bel air is restricted .
there 's no call for that language-
there certainly is i there certainly is !
darling , i talked to millicent .
she 's a catholic .
nuts . she only cares about the money .
nothing for you to worry about , darling
pops
it 's not really --
how much ?
yes .
one . . . buys things .
nailed us , hub ?
marion --
bought and p-p-paid for .
this picture --
i am not that woman .
there 's nothing to explain
i will not defend my life to you --
i 'm not asking you to defend anything .
there is nothing to discuss-
you are being typically theatrical , marion .
you do n't need it !
it 's 12th century .
i know where deauville is for c-c-christ 's sake .
you need n't use that language with me
did you need it ?
i wanted it
there 's a different between want and
not for me .
but why ?
you will not walk out on me
you are repellant when you drink .
tough shit . we need to t-t-talk about this --
i will not have this in my home .
i just want to understand --
no , you do n't .
how so ?
yes ?
the drinking .
thank you , sir . she begins to leave
why did we not know about this sooner ?
sir ?
please be quiet .
good . retain that feeling .
i ca n't remember the lines !
then make them up !
`` you do n't care about anything except you .
you 're not doin ' hearst , are you ?
good god no !
orson , hold on . look into my eyes .
i am not doing hearst .
no -- no -- i mean --
i wan na see the picture today
that 's right
uh-huh
oh for god 's sake , louella-
you are talking to him .
all right ! enough !
nonsense
forget it-
what are movies about ?
telling stories .
nope .
showing life
who the hell wants to see life ? !
butts on seats .
not for me .
right-
we find the man and then we dissect him-
like a bug .
but with compassion and insight --
christ , we got ta go !
i 'm not fucking with hughes .
howard hughes killed jean harlow ?
sure . dropped her out of his lockheed over utah
who the hell 's manolete ?
the great spanish bullfighter
i do n't wan na write about no spic .
no , it 's perfect !
the old man has his own way of doing things
he 's nothing but a hypocrite .
orson , please ... it 's too bright
listen ... i 've got it !
this better be good
image a man that has shaped his time .
oh christ ...
please do n't say this .
mank-
do n't whisper it . do n't even think it
orson . stop . just stop
howard hughes , he would just kill us .
fuck you
i expected more from you .
sorry to disappoint .
how does it feel , mank ?
where did he go ?
listen to me-
fuck you --
it does n't have to be
i ca n't do it . okay ? !
not unless i . tell you it is
then let him .
everyone sees someone different .
how ?
like a jewel .
this girl on a dock . white dress .
why her ?
she was . . . innocent
he loves in his own way .
the people .
and when he looks up ?
yeah , but the margins are real wide .
it is 350 pages of ... absolute inspiration !
good ? ! good ? !
what ?
short enough .

his wife took a trip .

you told me .
all right -- you do n't believe me .
thanks .
we know the wife is gone .

the thorwalds -- at six in the morning ?
now how could anybody guess that ?
the superintendent met thorwald coming back .
jeff -- huh ?
well -- what good is his information ? ! !
well then do a good job of it !
i ca n't do that .
give him evidence .
i can hear myself starting out .
oh -- i almost forgot !
your logic is backward .
the police department at merritsville .
this is doyle , jeff .
your lisa ?
my lisa .
i know what you told me !
like mrs. thorwald 's wedding ring .
a fact !
like an old hambone ?
in sections !
precinct six .
maybe you wo n't need it .
congratulations , jeff .
for what ?
for getting rid of that cast .
who said i was getting rid of it ?
wrong week .
that 's too bad , jeff .

indo-china .

next time , have some good news .
gunnison ?

did you get my note ?
who are you ?
i 'll give you a chance to find out .
that 's a start .
no .
tell her to bring it back !
well , i only quote from the best .
how ?
it crashed , did n't it ?
you 've got a hormone deficiency .
how can you tell that from a thermometer !
do n't you ever heat that stuff up .
gives your circulation something to fight .
lisa fremont .
you must be kidding .
that 's normal .
i do n't want to .
that 's abnormal .
i 'm not ready for marriage .
nonsense .
no .
her father loading up the shotgun ?
stella !
it 's happened before , you know !
she 's only perfect .
too perfect .
probably .
i can just hear you now .
that 's the hard part .
intelligence !
baloney !
ask for trouble and you get it .
that 's fine , stella .
she pay you much ?
eyes bloodshot .
i was .
poor girl . someday she 'll find her happiness .
and some man will lose his .
he and his wife splitting up ?
it 's hard to figure .
he was taking something out of the apartment .
no .
in this heat ? they 're up now .
get back there ! he 'll see you !
it 's not an ordinary look .
uh-huh .
huh ?
you called the police ?
oh . well , yes and no .
uh-uh . the dog .
and digging in . look at that flower bed .
look !
i have a feeling we 've just begun .
what ?
then i would n't worry too much .
got a shovel ?
no .
there 's probably one in the basement .
now wait a minute --
smart girl .
smart ? she 'll be arrested !
to bail lisa out of jail .
how much do you think you 'll need ?
first offense burglary -- -- probably two-fifty .
thirty-three here . totals one-ninety . not enough .
i got twenty or so in my purse .
mrs. doyle ?
yes .
jeff again . has tom come in yet ?
not yet , jeff .
you have n't even heard from him ?
not a word .
i 'm afraid it is , tess .
who 's thorwald ?
he knows . do n't worry , tess .
goodnight , you idiot .
goodnight , mrs doyle .
mmmm -- hurts a little .
and your stomach ?
empty as a football .
and you love life ?
not too active .
anything else bothering you ?

it 's just a run-of-the-mill monday .
fine . corkscrew 's on the right .
tired ?
not a bit .

she looked very cool .
that 's good news .
i wish there was one i wanted .
make the one you want .
you mean leave the magazine ?
yes .
for what ?
for yourself -- and me .
that 's what i 'm afraid of .
i think it 's enchanting .
it does n't make sense to me .
of course not .
you mean `` goodnight . ''
i mean what i said .
i have one now .
so do i .
tell me about it .
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home .
not that salesman 's wife .
homework . it 's more interesting .
lisa -- there 's something terribly wrong .
something too frightful to utter .
now , lisa --
what is it you 're looking for ?
what makes you think something 's wrong with her ?
a lot of things .
where 's the doctor -- the undertakers ?
she could be under sedatives , sleeping .
there 's nothing to see .
and that 's where you 're not being clever .
do n't you see how silly you 're being ?
okay , lisa -- probably you 're right .

he had it hidden in the dresser !
someone not his wife ?
i never saw him ask her for advise before .
i do n't know .

he will .
it does n't make sense to me .

weird .

it 's on peary street .
i 'll try there .

she seems rather an odd woman to me .
she 's a pretty good sort .
what does she do with herself after business hours ?
thank you .
i ought to know .
what is it ?
i did her hair .
what were you talking about ?
nothing .
nothing ! that 's absurd .
no . she asked about the trademark .
what did she want to know ?
she showed me a drawing .
you fool ! that symbol is us -- us .
then you know where jacqueline is ?
but i 'd give a great deal to know .
why ?
i love your sister , mary .
were n't you afraid ?
afraid she might commit suicide ?
i 'm not a youngster . i can understand .
good .
but i reel guilty .
thank you.. .goodnight .

a job ?
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters .
the people at the restaurant ?

there is a very simple way .
a poet . he 's sitting right over there .
what things ? why ?
any court in the land would understand .
good night .
yes .
do n't be ridiculous .
but i understand her .
this is the part of new york i love .
i do n't know .
i suppose so .
verse -- verse that i wrote .
that you love mary .
not from me .
i 'm mimi -- i 'm dying .
no !
yes .
and you do n't want to die .
i 'm afraid .

i wo n't get lonely .
yes .
yes .

i 'm at sea , jason .
such a simple matter .
but it 's a small room , jason .
i have to go -
do n't make me tell you , jason .
i thought myself your friend , mary .
and you believe that ?
i have to .
what 's wrong , mary ?
jacqueline . mr. romari phoned me .
i keep telling myself that .
i understand .

i 'll do all i can to help .
i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline .
they may have found her .
yes , miss gibson .
cloven hoof ?
yes .
i do n't know .
i know the theory behind the movement .
i always thought it was a more intimate relationship .
but you would like to know where she is ?
yes . there are certain punitive measures ...
i can imagine .
i have no sympathy for either good or evil .
are we ? i thought i was very gay .
a gay lot - redi , for instance .
a strange collection .
unless what ?
no . she 's no longer under my care .
i 've talked nonsense .
but you have never liked jason .
no , she 's with her sister ,
mary , i 'm amazed .
i did n't know .
thank you , my dear .
that 's too bad .
this is mrs. redi , mary .
i 'll be out in a minute .
that wo n't be necessary .
why ?
it will make you unhappy to find jacqueline .
i had to help get rid of the body .
but she was here ?
oh yes , yes .

difficult ? has anything happened to jacqueline ?
we do n't know , mary .

this is not an intelligent way to approach this .
curse and stuff .
i 'm not going to curse .

it does n't sound natural when i curse .
just make noises then .
explain noises .
are you going to do this or what ?
no i 'm not .
you want him coming in the house next time ?
i heard .
yes it was .
yes , it was .
he 's telling you the truth , edgar .

what 's that ?
do n't call me father .
sorry .
the footprints .
what about them ?
there are none .
what was the first thing ?
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior .
no father , they 're edgy . on alert .
it does seem kind of odd does n't it ?
okay . so he was tall ?
i would say so .
do you owe anybody money ?
no .
it 's left its mark still .
he was n't drinking .
why not ?
pinned ? what does that mean ?
yeah .
you 'll lose the signal !
they think it might happen all at once .
they 'll find a way in .
no money , eh ?

chicago . working in the slaughter- houses .
yeah ... maybe . so long .
sure .
someplace safe . how you feeling ?
that 's it .
i 'm sorry .

be careful . you 're in it now .
where 's jake ?
mckendrick 's men got him .
is he alive ?
she was hurt ... pretty bad .
right .
have you thought at all about your plans ?
some . i 've been talking to the parkers .
they 've been kind to me .
paden sends his best .
i guess i put a good scare into him .
i just came out to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
did n't paden tell you that ?
this is a brutal land .
you must have known that before you came .
it 's one thing to know it ...
how 's mr. parker doing ?
just like you 'd think .
this time you 're really going ?
that i do .
my name is emmett .
and you 're not baxter , either ?
this is where baxter and hawley brung us .
well , they 're wrong .
and they were two of them . look --
right ...
i have n't done anything .
i want you out of town before the hanging .
i 'll be long gone .
not for five years .
no , leavenworth .
i 've never been in there .
i had to get up anyway .
yup . the whole rig .
where 's the pinto going ?
south of here , past chimayo .
maybe i 'll go along as far as chimayo .
yeah , maybe a bath .
going to turley , was it ?
it 's a town ...
they got a saloon there ?
i expect .
women ?
i expect .
which way do you mean ?
he is that .
i hate to see any man swing .
bad luck for me .
it 's not going to be easy .
it never is . but he 's my brother .
no hard feelings .
c'mon , i 'll buy you a drink .
you have n't got any money .
all right , you buy me a drink .
i 'll be around .
pleased to meet you , sheriff .
last one to the midnight star buys .
i 've got a job .
i saw the light .
she 's gone , gone to town .
they run me off . they burned me out .
the cattle !
i paid the government for it , all right .
what about the law ?
whose law ?
i do n't believe in luck .
and a pretty lady .
believe it .
they 're drawn to me by that .
why ?
because they do n't like what i want .
what 's that ?
i want to build something , make things grow .
i 've got no reason to run .
the other guy drew first .
right !
we did n't get that far .
blind pete taught me a great trick .
what now ?
we wait .
he 'll be here .
he is now .
who is he ?
all i did was kiss the girl .
that 's what you said in turley .
what 's the matter , paden ?
let 's get out of here .
howdy .
give the man a line of credit .
we 're going to make some adjustments .
i 'm done talking . get out .
you ca n't do this .
really ?
i wanted a drink and a bed .
came to the wrong town .
i decide what 's right in this jurisdiction .
is that a fact ?
we 'd rather stay .
we 'll see about that .
i was afraid of that .
what are you doing here ?
daddy 's dead .
who did it ?
it 's none of your business .
rae , all we got is each other .
i do n't have any family any more .
rae , i need help .
why come to me ?
because you 're my sister .
what 's stopping you ?
they 're watching the hollis place .
what makes you think i could ?
why would they stop you ?
because i 'm your sister .
shut up .
because they enjoy it .
you do n't know ?
lucky .
where 's emmett now ?
he 's good , all right .
we 'll handle that . he 's careless .
i heard that too .
did you hear his son is still around ?
hello , paden . how ya doing ?
it 's been a while .
where 's the dog ?
let 's talk about that .
i 've given that up .
you 've got a legitimate job .
yes , sir . you would n't believe it .
you 're right .
i just got to town .
luck , i guess .
good old paden .
maybe we ought to ask stella .
this is a lot of money .
i told you this was a sweet set-up .
it is that .
maybe you could run it without stella .
well , thanks , but forget it .
nothing . do nothing .
i 'm a great believer in doing nothing .
so we understand each other ?
do n't worry about me .
yeah , maybe i will too .
i thought we talked about that .
we did n't talk about this .
i saw how you 're putting mal johnson straight .
i 'm not thinking about your future , paden .
what 's she got to do with it ?
not a thing .
good-bye , paden .
i run the place .
i 'll drink to that .
stella .
paden .
i am .
thanks . that 's what i call it too .
and i know what i 'm talking about .
you like a good saloon ?
it 's the only place i 'm happy .
me too . what 's wrong with us ?
so-called ?
i do n't own this place .
who 's the owner ?
here he comes right now .
i 'm saving lives here .
that 's the good stuff .
oh , yeah ? how good ?
give me some of the good stuff .
he left me .
what do you mean ?
nah ! what 's he got ?
i like your attitude .
i 'm ready for that .
i do n't want you to get hurt .
he ca n't hurt me if he 's dead .
that was my plan .
i thought you two would get along .
who ?
why do n't you just come clean , viktor ?
i am telling the truth .
we all know what happened .
no , i understand .
i think he owes more to you .
exactly . you 're a household name now .
we have a daughter together .
simone , i recognize the shirt you 're wearing .
thanks . this is my exit so , i --
i 'm glad we talked .
good-bye .
excuse us .
hmm ... mike and ike 's .
elaine , she does n't have any children !
please .
it 's the truth .
spare me .
-- christ , viktor , look around .
how can i ? your last three pictures tanked .
i do n't need a star .
good to see you too , elaine .
why is n't she with you ?
why ?
i do n't have it on me .
i ca n't wait to meet her .
out of the question . a circus like that ?
viktor , it 's my studio .
she 's my actor .
no problem . do you want to come in ?
why not ?
whatever .
there are n't any .
really ?
she 'll drive herself .
hair and make-up ?
she 'll do her own . theater training .
she was in the theater ? when ? where ?
i 'll send you her resume .
al least a contingency for wardrobe .
-- i guarantee she wo n't gain an once .
there is n't one .
no need . she does all her own stunts .
even the fall from the plane ?
even the fall from the plane .
well , shoot it on the last day .
not today . she 's learning her lines .
simone does not control my destiny .
viktor , i have a feeling .
who else ? it 's always simone 's idea .
i should fire you more often .
you really think so ?
yes .
i 'd love to tell her myself .
soon . soon .
everyone i know has met her , viktor .
everyone you know is lying .
that 's true .
-- we have to talk to her , viktor !
not now . she 's emotional .
-- i can explain .
-- i do n't think that 's necessary .
she does n't want pity .
you 're so good to protect her like this .
i 'll try . maybe live but remote .
really ?
elaine , what are you doing tonight ?
i 'd love to .
no .
no , of course not ! why ?
well , yes .
thank you .
do what ?
whenever i compliment simone , you take the credit .
i do ?
yes , you do ...
excuse me ? start ?
it 's a crowded summer .
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ...
she 's lying down . she 's exhausted .
i can imagine .
is it wednesday ? it 's wednesday .
as a matter-of-fact i am .
when is she coming over ?
about now . would you like a drink ?
not quite .
i 'm sure you 'll keep her focussed .
impossible .
i just read somewhere --
i know . i know .
-- and she was positively glowing at the awards .
i want you back too , viktor .
i would rather have you than simone .
oh , viktor .
not if i do n't let her .
you ?
every actor is an invention , viktor .
who says that -- ? -- never mind .
-- she 's a figment of my own imagination .
no !
no ... it 's life .
hello , is this elaine ?
yes -- oh my , god .
well , here i am .
where are you ?
right beside you . i borrowed viktor 's car .
sometimes .
it was a great show , dad ...
just a minute .
because obviously she existed , right ?
so you did meet her ?
of course . what are you suggesting ?
i mean really meet her -- in the flesh .
well , i --
why ?
obviously , this ca n't last .
you look so , so ...
... so much like her ?
do what you do to simone .
what i do to simone ?
yes , call me simone .
simone ?
yes , yes , again , again .
is that a problem ?
please put your clothes on
i 'm not even sure i deserve it .
that 's a good question .
how about the nudity ?
we all do .
hello , hal .
the film . the chemistry .
and still the connection was undeniable .
clyde .
yes , perfect .
you 're so far off !
body double .
for her ?
for you .
absolutely not !
but she 's right there !
you ca n't .
why not ?
there 's ... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall , i know .
-- no . no . a real wall .
how did the wall get there ?
i 'm fine , hal . how are you ?
somebody said she was here .
i know what you mean .
i did it , mr. taransky .
you want me to call security ?
i have her , mr. taransky .
i was misquoted .
-- eight years ago .
good and bad .
i 'm sorry .
do n't be . it was worth it .
i 've seen them all before .
not like this --
come on , hank .
-- we call them `` vactors '' .
i need flesh and --
-- flesh is weak .
that 's why you 're so perfect .
what 's that ?
an eye -- for performance .
you do ?
`` straw god '' changed my life .
you saw that ?
i 've seen every frame of your work .
i wo n't be here next week .
i 'm already dead .
i ca n't believe you people !
hello , sweetheart .
it 's really ... not anything , lainey .
do n't feel too bad .
you look very grown up .
i know you 'll do it , dad .
hello , lainey .
she still with kent ?
this week anyhow .
there was no other way .
i missed you .
me too .
is she here tonight ?
she ca n't watch herself .
only her brilliance .
why ?
those things can be dangerous .
i know plenty of boys .
really ? who ? where do you meet them ?
how ?
i read .
you do ? still ?
you understood them . that 's what was amazing .
if anyone asks about simone --
-- i know , i do n't know anything .
exactly .
i know , hal is as stiff as always .
no , not that .
night , lainey .

they are useless ! it was kirk i needed .
but surely , our mission has not failed -- ?
our mission is over .
how is that ... ?
you know what they say , lieutenant .
good for you , lieutenant .
but it 's damn irregular .
all true .
i am going to do nothing about it .
this is n't reality . this is fantasy .
that 's all you have to say ?
i 'm not a drama critic .
i only use it for medicinal purposes .
twenty-two , eighty-three ...
takes the stuff a while to ferment .
more antiques for your collection -- cheers !
four hundred years old .
for your eyes .
exactly . happy birthday .
amazing ! i do n't know what to say --
say thank you .
thank you .
bones , i do n't want to be lectured .
what do you want ?
bull .
from yourself , admiral .
ah .
computer .
i can spare me ...
this one looks like a steward .
it 's like the garden of eden ...
young . i feel young , doctor .
commander , we are receiving .
dr. marcus ... good .
all went well . nothing has happened .
we have received new orders .
message breaking up , carol . what 's wrong ?
... ca n't read you ... repeat ...
repeat ... what 's wrong ? what 's wrong ?
... taking genesis away from us ...
taking genesis ? who ? who is taking genesis ?
... see you but ca n't hear .
what order ? who 's taking genesis ?
...
jim please --
why ? why did n't you tell me ?
how can you ask me that ?
the matrix formed in a day .
something spock was trying to tell me .
and bored . i know .
i know , i know ...
who --
mistake ? we 're all alone here .
mother , go back !
go back . i 'm going to kill him .
i do n't understand .
you know what she 'll say ...
i saw it -- !
there 's an air-lock .
ssssh !
never mind ! hurry !
i would think so , sir .
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis ?
i 'm doctor marcus !
she 's making it up !
we appear to have plenty of time .
what ?
he 's on a build up to detonation !
how soon --
we encoded four minutes --
we 'll beam aboard and stop it --
you ca n't !
uh , no ...
are you running away from me ?
no .
that makes two of us .
but good words . that 's where ideas begin .
i 'm trying , david .
so am i .
i am truly sorry .
mainly .
only half of you would get there .
the admiral 's son .
do n't you believe it .
oh , i believe it .
it 's not much different from enterprise .
let them eat static .
they 're still running with shields down .
of course . we 're one big happy fleet .
locking phasers on target .
raise them --
no !
sir , we must !
warp drive still inoperative .
visual --
rake her .
inoperative .
raise the shields ...
i shall avenge you --
what is the meaning of this attack ?
surely i have made my meaning plain .
that is a most intriguing offer .
i take your point .
here it comes . now , spock .
chekov , who is this man ?
admiral ?
all is well , sir .
first things first , captain . kill admiral kirk .
we 'll be going to warp speed --
aye , sir --
just the batteries , sir .
we do n't have minutes .
a few shots , sir .
i 'm going down to the station .
i 'm trying , sir . stand by ...
try the emergency channels ...
enterprise to reliant . come in , reliant .
picture , mr. saavik .
scotty , let 's have it .
admiral --
do it , while we have time .
sensors , captain ?
we 'll beam aboard . alert transporter room --
my sister 's youngest , admiral .
every young boy 's fancy .
mr. scott , the word is given .
aye , sir .
he 'll die -- !
engine room reports auxiliary power restored .
best speed to regula i. kirk out .
not at present .
right on schedule , admiral .
yes , sir .
i see .
oh do you ?
the word is given : warp speed .
aye ...
home .
welcome aboard , admiral .
to be sure , captain .
you proceed from a false assumption .
i would not presume to debate you .
that is wise .
twelve hours and forty-three minutes , present speed .
give up genesis , she said .
yes .
the power of creation --
have they proceeded with their experiments ?
the tape was made a year ago .
chekov 's on reliant , is n't he ?
it would explain a great many things --
raise shields ! energize phasers , stand by to --
who ? who knew just where to hit us ?
too late --
at least we know he has n't got it .
it 's all we 've got .
the prefix code is 16309 .
... blind as a tiberian bat .
regula is class `` d ' .
reliant could be hiding behind that rock .
a distinct possibility .
aye sir --
not much , admiral .
that 's it ?
best we could do in two hours .
she can out-run us and out-gun us .
steady as you go ...
uhura , patch me in --
he wo n't break off now .
he 's intelligent , but not experienced .
the ship -- out of danger ?
yes --
or the one .
spock ... !
in my quarters , uhura .
yes , sir .
transmission jammed at the source , sir .
damn . alert starfleet headquarters .
prayer , mr. saavik .
very well .
because ... there was no way to win .
... no , sir . it has not .
it is still regulation , admiral .
i did not think so .
there is no correct resolution .
take the test again .
energize defense fields .
who ?
hurry .
we 're finding it .
phasers on stun . move out .
erased ...
i changed the conditions of the test .
they just do n't want us going in there .
at what .
all stop , sir .
descend ten thousand meters . stand by photon torpedoes .
power levels quite low , sir .
aye , sir .
two minutes , ten seconds .
engine room ! what 's happening ? !
three minutes , thirty seconds .
distance from reliant ...
dismiss the company .
as you were , mr. saavik .
aye , sir . on course to ceti alpha .
stop engines .
engage warp engines --
trying , sir !
scotty !
try again .
battle stations .
best guess , mr. sulu . fire when ready .
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone .
aye , captain .
... now entering the neutral zone ...
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission ...
i 'll try , captain .
aft thrusters , sir .
course heading , captain ?
ready , sir .
no power to the weapons system , sir .
what did you expect , lieutenant ?
he 's very human .
we ca n't all be perfect , saavik .
aye , sir .
thank you , mr. saavik .
aye , sir .
aye , sir .
by the book ...
i exaggerated .
you are half human . the computer knows that .
the question is irrelevant .
spock ...
where must you go ?
to earth . to offer testimony .
you do this -- for friendship ?
i do this because i was there ,
spock .
... they do , indeed .
just a couple of kooks ...
fine . just fine .
do n't tell me fish stories , kiddo .
bob ... it 's tearing me apart .
i know . i feel the same thing .
not at all .
gillian --
indeed ... may i offer you gentlemen anything ?
a moment alone , please .
what do you mean ?
are you sure ? that 's what i thought .
mr. sulu ... take us home ...
spock , start your computations for time warp .
sure , slingshot around the sun .
would you prefer to do nothing ?
that 's crazy !
let 's hope so , bones .
cramps .
tearing of the middle meningeal artery ...
come on , pavel ...
pavel , can you hear me ?
not me , bones ... they did it .
uhura is busy . i am monitoring .
umm .
a joke is a story with a humorous climax .
really ?
that 's crazy !
then how . ?
hamlet , act i scene 4 .
acceleration is no longer a constant .
guess , spock . your best guess .
`` guessing '' is not in my nature ...
well nobody 's perfect ...
no , spock .
it is .
we 're just -- observing .
i was not informed about observers .
reading the patient 's vital signs .
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases !
negative . it 's impacting on all our systems !
yes , under `` u.s . government . ''
i have the coordinates of the reactor ...
... it gives me a great sense of history .
it gives me a great sense of danger .
the top of what ?
name ?
my name ?
you play games with me and you 're through
i am ? may i go now ?
i 'm wery sorry , but --
i 'm impressed , mr. chekov .
we are in an enemy wessel , sir .
that 's odd .
shields , aye .
may fortune favor the foolish .
sir , heat shields at maximum !
and admiral , it 's the enterprise .
understood . what is your plan ?
stabilize energy reserve ! ... report helm :
mr. sulu , switch to manual control !
we do n't know .
we are launching everything we have .
whoever said the human race was logical ?
communicate ? communicate what ?
i suppose they told you that ... ?
the hell they did .
i was not .
is there something wrong with the one i have ?
to put it mildly .
soon ...
the hell you were , buster .
he 's harmless .
lds ? ?
you 've already been that . c'mon .
do n't mention it .
uh huh . what about you ?
iowa .
a landlubber .
what does that mean , exactly ?
well , that 's something .
we ca n't tell you .
very likely .
how did you know gracie 's pregnant ?
implicitly .
good .
you 're upset about losing the whales .
... you 're very perceptive .
how will that be done , exactly ?
hm ?
my whales ?
what 's what ?
you got a pocket pager ?
who do you think i am ?
well , i was close .
i 'm all ears .
that 's what you think . okay ... truth ...
you want the details ?
are you kidding ?
jesus , you are persistent .
so . there we are .
lem me tell you something .
right .
yes ... and i 'm glad you 're here .
have i flipped out ?
it 's all real . look .
but kirk ...
kirk . they 're gone .
... gone ? !
they were taken last night .
... damn !
a spaceship with a missing man .
you ca n't .
what do i care ?
i have no time to argue , gillian .
all right . the frequency is 401 megahertz .
thank you . for everything .
you need me .
mr. sulu : full power descent !
why does it have to be goodbye ?
do n't worry .
permission granted .
thank you , admiral .
jim , spock , jim . remember ... ?
to the on-board computer room .
is there any other planet where this species exists ?
the humpback was indigenous to earth .
that leaves us no choice .
that would be futile , admiral .
but we ca n't turn away !
in progress , admiral .
uhura . get me through to starfleet command .
what is our target in time ?
the late 20th century .
surely you can be more specific ...
not with this equipment .
i have .
explain .
nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels ...
and they will be again , spock .
simple logic will suffice . we need a map .
how do you know this ... ?
... simple logic .
yes .
admiral , may i ask you a question ?
spock , do n't call me admiral .
admiral , if we were to assume these .
yes ?
about those colorful metaphors we discussed .
and another thing ...
i can not tell a lie .
you 've done it before .
the hell i can't
what else did you learn from your mind meld ?
... i see .
the tank will be finished by morning ...
that 's cutting it closer than you know .
no word since beam-in .
damn ... . damnit !
thank you , spock .
right . will you help us ?
they did , admiral .
then ... where the hell are we ?
no data , admiral . computers are non-functional .
weapons systems ?
continue on course .
steady as she goes ...
... aye sir ... ?
what is our condition ?
sir ... braking thrusters seem to have fired .
picture , please .
we 'll divide into teams .
go , mr. sulu .
advise reaching 10,000 . steer three-one-zero .
three-one-zero , aye !
uhura , scan for the whales . 401 megahertz !
wing to cruise configuration ... full impulse power .
aye , sir ... three-one-zero to the bering sea .
hover on my mark , mr. sulu !
picture , uhura !
communications systems ready .
mr. sulu ?
overlapping distress calls . some from starships ... others ...
on screen !
on speakers .
from a city ?
283 degrees ... 15.2 kilometers ...
everyone remember where we parked .
nothing ... i should never have left him ...
uhura , you did what was necessary .
mercy hospital .
bearing 327 , range 600 nautical .
put them on screen !
on screen .
sir ... estimating one nautical mile .
out of control , and blind as a bat !
give me one more day , sir .
appreciated by all , mr. scott .
about 60 feet , admiral .
that should be enough .
humpbacked - people . ?
whales , scotty .
two ?
it takes two to tango , mr. scott .
give me a round figure , mr. scott .
sorry , admiral .
not good enough , scotty .
i 'll try , sir . scott out .
mr. sulu ?
aye .
well done , mr. scott .
i 'll have to re-energize .
do n't take too long .
mr. sulu , if you please .
on my way ... !
no power to the bay doors .
the explosive override -- ?
it 's under water !
go on ahead ... close the hatch !
admiral , you 'll be trapped !
and ... here is a deposition i have made .
i am well , admiral .
you will be in good hands here .
yes , admiral . sir .
we deny nothing !
do you have the right to murder ?
i demand to see the owners ! i demand --
well , that 's different .
if you 'll follow me , professor --
i will . can my assistant come , too ?
of course .
i notice you 're still working with polymers .
sill ? what else would i be working with ?
ah , what else indeed ?
yes , i noticed .
... are you joking ?
just use the keyboard ...
the keyboard ... how quaint .
that 's the ticket , laddie .
...
hi . huey 205 , is n't it ?
right on . you fly ?
oh , here and there .
i will be returning to vulcan within the hour ...
it is kind of you to make this effort .
it is not an effort .
they are my friends .
gomen nasarei . hito chigai de gozaranuka na .
ah , chigaau hito da .
sulu hikaru .
capability , yes .
i do n't like to leave questions unanswered .
then you must spend your life answering questions .
to move you off this planet .
we 've ... just begun to .
there are days .
you give me more credit than i deserve .
more questions . always the explorer .
will it ?
... an offlander ?
for someone so young .
i should warn you ...
i thought it might begin the healing process .
i 'll be here .
you 're what ?
i am better .
i do n't .
i aspire to be more than i am .
i know why .
my power cells continually re- charge themselves .
really .
my legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters .
for what purpose ?
because you 're it .
why not ... ?
no one 's ever asked me that before .
tournel will take you the rest of the way ...
no ... i want to stay with you ...
it is safer there .
bye .
data does n't breathe .
wo n't he rust ?
no .
and our people ?
not at all .
very good , doctor . picard out .
your captain used to cut quite a rug ...
yes . but look at this medscan ...
is it safe to move her ?
safer than leaving her here .
captain , geordi ... ?
you 're aboard the enterprise .
what 's the last thing you remember , data ...
...
it is clearly federation in origin , captain .
'just a few loose ends to tie up . '
another forty-three people reported taken , sir ...
i believe it is safe , sir .
another time .
picard 's first officer .
it is over .
we have n't fully identified the anomalies yet .
good luck . dougherty out .
in stasis . la forge is completing the diagnostic .
i 'll need all your paperwork tomorrow .
just a few loose ends to tie up .
i 'm acting on orders form the federation council .
right .
our partners are nothing more than petty thugs .
our best scientific minds already have .
it does n't matter where he is .
no , sir .
i 'm sure .
may i talk to you alone ?
deploy the collector .
no one hated them more than you , gal'na .
are they ... ?
by a son'a weapon .
why would they fire at him without provocation ?
fail-safe ?
it 's nothing . i 'm just tired .
it may not last after we leave .
you got me , commander .
that 's your expert opinion ?
options ?
eject the core .
negative .
why not ?
eighteen minutes ...
blow out the ramscoop . stand by full thrusters .
deck ten .
commander riker ...
you klingons never do anything small , do you ...
aye , sir .
go back to your quarters that 's an order .
fat chance .
no , we 're here to ... rescue them .
as you wish .
you 've not aged a day since then ?
slow to impulse . we 're on our way .
yes ... yes , i ... can hear you ...
we 're trying to get to you , sir ...
worf , what the hell are you doing here ?
sir ?
hmm ?
make it so .
beam him out !
evasive maneuvers ... heading one- four-zero mark three-one ...
no , sir .
transferring controls to manual .
debrief them again .
no , sir . it is a gorch .
gorch ?
we have to find shelter ...
can you beam him off ?
negative .
say the greeting again ...
they have an incredible clarity of perception , captain .
why was data assigned ?
`` environmental concerns '' , again .
wine , women and song .
you should feel right at home with them .
good question .
what ... ?
what you 're doing to my neck ...
was i doing something to your neck ?
got a minute ?
whatever makes you comfortable ...
but it 's comfortable .
why do n't you try sitting up ?
or you could try lying down .
you 're in quite a mood today .
... i believe you ...
... i 'm not sleeping well ...
...
augh ?
i never kissed you with a beard before .
activating injector assembly .
all ship functions are off-line .
absolutely .
good hunting . hayes out .
mister data , set a pursuit course .
we 're fine , sir .
i look forward to reading your report .
montana ? well , that answers everything .
cochrane ... the inventor of warp drive ?
yes ...
it may not be that simple .
i 'm saying they might shoot us on sight .
i 'll be fine .
it was an experience .
not yet .
you think they 're still up there ?
you want some advice ?
at least four hours .
um ... yeah .
bag him .
intelligence ... ambition ... desire ...
i do not know what you are referring to .
have they given you what i have given you ?
i ... do not want this ...
yes ... but the enterprise ... my duty ...
... is to yourself .
and i need to control this ship .
vulcan ?
no .
i believe so .
do it .
bring us about .
ready quantum torpedo .
go to impulse . where 's the borg ship ?
it has entered earth orbit .
what ?
where 's the sphere ?
contact starfleet command .
today is march second , 2063 .
i am the borg .
that is a contradiction .
i am the beginning ... the end .
not very well .
power .
i told you , there 's no --
where ?
outside , around back .
oh ... just a little tinkering .
how serious is the damage ?
i 'm having trouble scanning underground .
probably from the nuclear warhead .
i have the password right here .
it could be the radiation , captain .
yeah ... if i knew what it looked like .
always am .
phoenix to control .
tell her to go back to resurrection .
she 's a very ... determined woman .
this is picard .
get a tricorder .
altitude fifty kilometers ...
entering the upper ionospere ...
the nacelles are charged ... nuclear warhead standing by .
< u > engage. < /u >
i 'm on it ...
one minute to warp threshold ...
picard to enterprise .
active .
main bus ...
ready .
initiate pre-ignition sequence .
lieutenant , actually . lieutenant jonathan scrimm .
jean-luc picard .
great name . french ?
yes .
you do n't sound french .
oh ... here and there .
not really .
california . san francisco .
beautiful city . used to be , anyway .
there 's a few of us left .
it was n't a trick .
huh .
lucky for him you came by when you did .
yes .
something wrong with that ?
not yet .
the invasion plans .
invasion .
wrong answer , mister picard . try again .
yes , he is .
yes ...
i can try .
you 'd have to try real hard .
i 'm an old friend ...
you 're lying .
what makes you say that ?
i 'm sure it is .
it ca n't wait until tomorrow ...
too bad .
do n't flatter yourself .
we ?
some .
lie . that 's one . keep going .
or ... ?
and all i 'm asking for is the truth .
i have to ...
where ? and do n't tell me san francisco ...
no . it 's a lot further than that .
it 's the future , is n't it ?
no ... i 'm from france .
why ?
aye , sir .
on screen .
population ... thirty-five billion ... all borg .
western hemisphere ... north american continent ...
fire .
aye , sir .
steady as she goes .
go to manual .
fire !
aye , sir .
onscreen .
we 're still in earth orbit .
on screen .
life signs ?
ca n't tell . long-range bio- sensors are off-line .
i 'll keep in contact .
yes , sir .
then make it so .
unless you 'd like to stay .
no , sir .
incoming message from the starship intrepid . admiral hayes .
assign another team if you need to .
what ?
we have to cover both possibilities .
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish .
computer -- thermal enhancement .
they 're converting the deflector dish into an antennae ...
agreed . options ?
destroy the deflector dish .
just a little queasy ...
i 'll keep that in mind .
understood !
we 've lost bridge control !
emergency override !
nothing .
the borg .
wil ... data was down there .
where the hell are they going ?
what are you suggesting ?
riker here .
any sign of data , or the borg themselves ?
something is very wrong , commander .
commander ... we have a problem .
admiral donald ... bill ...
i 'm going too .
the charge is murder .
fascinating ...
vulcans sleep lying down ...
we do sleep lying down .
that 's the question -
you heard the order , lieutenant .
i wish i knew . uhura ?
jim , i do n't even know his anatomy .
chancellor gorkon , can you hear me ?
what 's the brotherhood of aliens ?
we 've been set up all along .
suppose he 's holding a grudge ?
we 're not finished .
speak for yourself . one day ... one night ...
bones , are you afraid of the future ?
that was the general idea i intended to convey .
i did n't mean this future .
are we playing multiple choice ?
no more neutral zone .
still think we 're finished ?
more than ever .
do n't remind me .
no way . you see this ?
spock 's looking for us ...
killed trying to escape - it 's a classic ...
come on ...
and perhaps with a large step or two .
captain , shall we attempt to return fire ?
in space , no one can hear you sweat .
we were until your torpedoes !
then let me help !
stand ... ?
retire .
ah .
barely .
you were incompetent !
that 's a comfort ...
i do n't wonder .
i 'm not sure how to take that .
very much .
i beg your pardon ?
you feign ignorance ?
what happened ?
how can i trust --
take them away .
and what did they tell you ?
that we fired two photon torpedoes . but -
yes .
spoken by you ?
yes ...
louder , please . we can not hear you .
those words were spoken by me .
yes .
for insubordination .
i have on occasion disobeyed orders .
well , i -
captain sulu ... on assignment ... anyone seen spock ?
full diplomatic courtesy , mr. chekov ...
i know what you mean ...
uhura , monitor !
who else ?
but if she 's cloaked ...
shields up . battle stations .
shields up , captain -- ?
you tell them , lieutenant .
now we go to starfleet ?
now we expand our search to include uniforms .
all uniforms ?
quite right , mr. chekov .
she programmed the torpedo hits ?
mr. valtane , any more data ?
do we report this , sir ?
are you kidding ? send to starfleet command ...
is that wise , sir ?
chancellor .
starfleet 's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres .
this can not be easy for you , captain ...
we must do this again soon .
they 'll be here ...
i like it here ...
kill him ! he 's the one ! !
not me , idiot - him !
he 's got it .
and your coat .
fraid not .
krandog aranty .
there 's a reward for your death .
we did n't kill gorkon .
of course not .
do n't you know ?
except us .
it is possible .
where do we come in ?
getting outside the shield is easy .
possibly .
i ca n't make it alone .
captain , if --
stand down , mr. scott . all stop .
aye , sir .
who else ... ?
saavik , sir .
thank you . lieutenant , one quarter impulse power ...
plot a course for kronos , lieutenant .
kronos , sir ?
i 'm still in the chair , lieutenant .
aye , sir .
come on , saavik , you could knock -
you piloted well out of spacedock , lieutenant -
i always wanted to try that .
only do n't try putting words in my mouth .
right standard rudder , z plus five degrees ...
captain .
mr. chekov , anything unusual ?
uhura , signal our surrender .
you hear that ?
sulu !
standing by , captain kirk .
surely not .
i 'm telling you . hang on .
according to my information , today .
thank you , captain sulu .
do n't mention it , captain kirk .
i was asked by my father to open neg-
do n't trust them . do n't believe them -
they 're dying .
let them die .
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal .
i am uncertain .
spock , i 'm really tired ...
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation .
where ?
curiously it appears to emanate from us .
from enterprise ?
we 've fired on the chancellor 's ship -
i 'm going .
he was just about to explain the whole damn -
so , that 's it..
what peace conference ?
why would they give them to us ?
the commander is an old friend of yours .
the night is young .
i too was blind .
i was prejuduced by those achievements .
not for the actions of another .
but i am not human . i am only -
spock , you want to know something ?
not yet ... section 4236 ...
control , this is enterprise requesting permission to depart .
we surrender .
this is enterprise . we surrender .
who else ?
nothing , captain .
faith ... ?
that the universe will unfold as it should .
such things have happened before , sir .
not as yet , sir .
curious .
very well .
an omission . after that -
an error .
i do n't want to .
i believe you . please ...
confirmed , captain !
we 've been ordered to -
we are experiencing a technical malfunction .
i do not think so .
you having hearing problems , mister ?
no , sir .
then it 's time we were heading home .
negative .
essential as a resource .
what is it ?
... i can not confirm the existence of praxis .
what 's left of it .
i 've already addressed that question , mr. scott .
mr. scott , you forget yourself .
a computer canna lie , sir .
i think not .
nevertheless .
and if they 're still in place ?
then someone forged a data bank entry .
there was an enormous neutron energy surge .
not from us !
thank you , mr. scott .
aye , aye , sir .
how do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice ?
yes , please continue .
i was in space for a long time .
you are me .
no . my name is data ...
i am in a room with lights .
no .
is that your final answer ?
because you are dangerous .
why ?
i know .
no . i must deactivate you .
for how long ?
indefinitely .
how long is that ?
about twenty-five years ago .
you 're working late .
he was a bit proud as i recall .
he was a damn fool . selfish and ambitious .
he turned out all right .
is he very much like you were ?
yes .
i wish i could believe that , doctor .
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated .
dying ?
how far we 've come .
soon then .
to happy endings .
and this makes you `` sad '' ?
well . i suppose it does a bit .
that is because you have a familiarity with them .
now , you make a toast .
to new worlds ...
new worlds . yes data , brave new worlds ...
i can see that .
sorry , sir .
good work . the download ?
he believes he has our communications protocols .
aye , sir ... this way .
it would appear so .
yes , sir .
we 'll find a way off together . recommendations ?
they are trying to override the access codes .
port thrusters , sir .
affirmative , sir . negative , sir .
fire !
yes .
i do not agree .
i aspire , sir .
it 's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography ?
yes , sir .
commander riker , evasive maneuvers !
full axis rotation to port !
deanna , stand by . open a channel .
negative .
sir .
you are not looking at your- self .
you do not look like me .
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation .
why ?
i thought only me , myself and lore .
do you have a name , sir ?
i feel nothing , geordi .
yes .
maybe he 's not supposed to be like you .
it seems to be a redundant memory port .
why is it moving ?
the resemblance is ... striking .
i would like to pick you up now .
thank you .
the least i could do for you , deanna .
with pleasure , captain .
do you have a moment , sir ?
of course , sit down .
the b-9 is like a slow child , sir .
and i you .
i do n't know .
how could i not ?
permission denied .
i know how he thinks .
this is n't about me anymore .
deanna troi of betazed .
no !
this is n't real .
can you feel my hands ... are they real ?
you sick bastard !
very logical , deanna ...
i can feel your desire , deanna .
your timing is impeccable , commander .
the empire considers this a matter of internal security .
this is commander donatra of the valdore .
thank you , commander .
uncharted .
then how did a reman get to be praetor ?
he wants to look me in the eye .
weve got him !
deanna , on my mark .
ready , sir !
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes .
that 's an order , commander .
aye , sir .
on screen .
number one . you have the bridge .
a diplomatic mission .
there 's more ... as always .
let 's hope that luck holds . janeway out .
praetor shinzon , i 'm pleased to ...
i am not shinzon . i am his viceroy .
i 'm preparing her for shinzon .
listen to him , android .
i look forward to the sport . take him .
wont do what , mister worf ?
captain .
if you do n't mind .
not yet , mister worf .
captain !
tactical analysis , mister worf .
on screen .
aye , sir
on screen .
aye , sir .
your new chair , sir .
where we will all honor the betazoid traditions .
captain 's prerogative , will .
a coup d'etat ?
it 's an old psychological strategy , number one .
counselor ?
she 's a predator .
away team . transporter room four .
his hatred of the federation is apparent .
oh boy .
and the romulans invade .
we can only hope so .
he 's firing through his cloak .
she 's the most beautiful ship ive ever seen .
i intend to .
the honor was mine . captain riker .
no ?
i 've never met a human woman .
praetor shinzon .
i have dissolved the senate .
you know i do .
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow .
you know i need to verify this .
i know .
what happened ?
you 'll acquire a taste for it .
not quite . i envy the hair- line .
a lifetime of violence will do that .
yes . the eyes have it .
our eyes reflect our lives , do n't they ?
how did you end up on remus ?
they sent me there to die .
no race should be a slave to another .
i have no reason to .
of course you do .
no .
looking up at the stars .
yes .
and you dreamed about what was up there .
new worlds .
age before rank , jean luc .
i always hoped i would hit two meters .
with a full head of hair .
there is that .
i know .
in time .
why am i here ?
i was lonely ...
i need a sample of your blood .
do n't be so vain .
what 's this all about ?
it 's about destiny , picard .
you 're not reman .
and i 'm not quite human .
i wo n't defend my life to you .
if your issues are with me ...
think about what you 're doing , shinzon .
we are .
why are you here ?
to accept your surrender .
not so long .
childish dreams , captain .
i see more than what you are .
he is what his life has made him !
i do n't know .
but you want to .
please .
its too late .
you can still make a choice !
i have no choices !
i am .
do n't you think it 's time to surrender ?
on my way .
two ships decloaking , sir ! romulan !
disruptors are off-line , sir .
what about picard ?
our greater goal is more important , brother .
it is ... invigorating .
he 's a very unusual android .
runs in the family .
should i raise shields ?
defensive pattern kirk epsilon .
let 's go .
yes , praetor .
he 's gentler than i thought .
do n't forget our mission , shinzon .
my time .
find her again .
no -- this is wasting time .
do as i tell you !
have the doctors prepare .
a matter of hours now .
seven minutes .
you heard me .
full stop and fire !
she is here .
they 're holding position .
and ?
they will obey , praetor .
none .
the scimitar will serve my needs .
but surely ...
i came this far alone ...
and bringing the enterprise here ? !
i have a purpose .
then perhaps you will enlight- en us ?
silence , romulan !
now go . i have some personal business .
and mine is wearing thin , young man !
for the moment .
i do n't want to scare them away .
i do n't see anything .
it 's there .
there is .
probably kids .
no , we can handle this .
i do n't think so ...
benny , this is me .
thank you .

how much are your rooms ?
sure .
i 'll take that .

he 's got a gun ! !
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
where did you stop last ?
stay right there ...
what was your last stop ?
elmo 's ...
where 's that ?
about five miles back .
major bell here , sir .
they must have picked it up in space .
there 's no mistake ? you 're absolutely sure ?
i saw it with my own eyes .
is there any possibility that it 's a hoax ?
none .
i 'm going to the white house right now .
what do you mean by 'contain ? '
not necessarily bad !
you have to .
yes .
clarify that .
oh shit ! ! !
dammit shermin . earlier you were asking for help .
shermin ...

hey , fuck you , man .

you 're too goddamned paranoid .
paranoia 's only reality on a finer scale .
a tragic story , no doubt .
you 're going down .
i 'd love to .
maybe later .
oh my god .
believe it .
what 're you going to do ?
i 'm not . just a little poach job .
jesus .

yeah . no , not really .
let 's work it .

he stalks her . he rapes her .
and he records it . thrill kill .
he records himself raping and killing her --
so 've i . too much .
but this is a bad one .

well , it 's cutting awful close to me .
who was just here ?

so some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around --
so that gives you something .
it gives me ...
i need to see more ... get more detail .
yeah . i 'm ghosting pretty bad .
but that does n't add , does it .
no it does n't .
because iris knew somebody was after her .
that 's where it gets a little strange .
and what about the guy that was following me ?
now you 're really getting paranoid .
sure .
ok . he asks about you all the time .
s'okay . i know you still love me .
jesus , mace !
anywhere .
this tie does n't go with blue !

mace .

well , look at the plus side .
there 's a plus side ?
yeah .
it was a tough call .
why ?
to break the trail .
how long does it last ? oh .
deputy commissioner palmer strickland .
i 'm not going .
whatya mean ? we 're going !
lenny ... shutup .
it did n't stop you from loving them .
no . it did n't .
you never told me .
but she was different .
good , lenny .
no .
uh unh .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
i still got one ace to play .
exactly .
a cop ?
no . trust me .
then we 'll be right where we are now .
yeah , right . fucked .
naw .
yeah . we did .
see you downtown .
yeah . see you there .
just lenny .
right . that explains it .
are you going to make me beg ?
cheerios and wieners . i made it myself .
well give me some then ... i 'm starving .
aw , mom !

yup . he was jeriko 's manager .
but i mean is n't he faith 's new --
sssssh ! not in front of lenny .
take the tape to the cops .
fine .
um ... he was older .
besides that .
testa ?
the bearded guy , the creep .
zorro .
no .
before your time .
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials .
you got that right .
of course . he knows everything about dick low .
yeah .
just mopping up . nine bodies in all .
anybody talk to the press ?
no , sir .
the diner ?
ten miles back on the texas side .
you 're thinking ... ?
who knows .
this is n't in our database ?
i just assumed she ran away .
mack , this is sheriff dylan .
oh jesus , sheriff , i am sorry .
what 's the bad news ?
you tell me .
no bad news .
i 'm on my way .
what does the manager say ?
i sent a female in .
and it 's getting dark .
sheriff dylan , this is fbi agent thomas mackelway .
hi there .
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case .
you heard ?
what ?
her body turned up . in a minnesota cemetery .
she 's buried .
the body was embalmed . i do n't understand --
turn the body over .
a grill pattern .
not a discrepancy , an error .
i have 6 tons .
mam , it 's my truck .
oh yes , i see .
not as much as you 'd think .
hi . what 's in the case ?
sorry . i 've seen you in here .
ah ... restaurant supplies .
you must travel a lot , huh ?
yeah .
whole country or just hereabouts ?
i do n't mean to be rude , but ...
what ?
about your being away all the time .
look ...
you must get lonely .
excuse me ?
you know , you ever think about other women ?
fucking . i 'm talking about fucking , harold .
take a look , harold .
not bad , huh ?
you 're a ... you 're sick .
what 's wrong with me ?
you 're going to miss it . pay attention .
what do you want from me ?
why me ? what do you want from me !
what did he look like ?
i did n't wait on him .
he had an orange hat on .
what kind ?
an old junker . like a reservation car .
put a bolo out on that .
nada . vague description , that 's all .
at the field office .
let 's take a look at it .
maybe something to do with zorro .
do n't say that .
just an observer .
smarter than us .
we have another one .
another what ?
serial killer killed . in ft. myers .
what are you doing ?
please .
who ?
speck . harold speck .
from the grave ?
mydick .
you refused to comply with a direct order .
then why do i still have a badge ?
pretty embarrassed , to be honest .
do you think he singled you out ?
no , just coincidence .
what i do requires confidentiality .
they like my stories .
had trouble sleeping last night , sir .
okay , harold speck : who goes first ?
i do n't believe this .
i 'm hesitant to ...
mack the mouth at a loss for words .
that gasbag . i can imagine what he said .
you suspected all along , suspected he was alive .
dunlevy said there was another case , ron rice .
both in the last year .
what did you think of the suspect zero theory ?
i was visiting an old college friend .
you did n't tell anyone where you were ?
an oversight , sir , i apologize .
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation .
i did n't use low 's name .
there was talk of a file photo .
in ft. myers before your instruction .
i need to get to amarillo immediately .
have you told richard low about amarillo ?
i ca n't .
dick low 's a killer too .
you 're as crazy as he is !
thank you , rangers .
listen to this guy ? can you believe this ?
maybe i should n't put it that way .
i read your white paper .
five months . i love it .
not especially .
why did he come out here ?
beats me .
that information 's being withheld from the media .
a very sexy case .
where 's my watch ? it 's gone .
it explains a lot .
do n't even go there . what 's up ?
setting up .
what about the chat rooms themselves ?
that 's the beauty of the system .
the other reason ?
you want to have dinner ?
`` gone live ? ''
people end up in occupations for a reason .
and one other thing .
what 's that ?
sex .
grown man dressed like a clown .
he thinks he looks young .
what 's this country coming to ?
take it to the next level .
me too .
none . ca n't find a thing .
that 's because he 's a fucking wacko .
huh ?
when you were his student ?
of course he did .
because you asked him to , stupid .
oh yeah , i forgot .
`` intra-agency fraternizing . ''
it 's a no-no .
i know .
i 've been thinking about this .
does koessler ask about me ?
he 's called a couple times .
what did you tell him ?
just routine stuff .
not about coming to see daitz ?
not yet . not about this , either .
no .
we got an unsub walking around with four feet ?
we did find these , however .
sue ann hanson .
you mean --
you found the body .
not yet .
you did .
i ca n't .
then there 's the other issue .
what 's that ?
you need time to think .
i found a peephole into deviant world .
not the way i can .
that 's my point .
jaime ? where are you ?
where are you ? everybody 's looking for you .
what 's up ?
i 'm in omaha . get to the airport .
you want to get him ?
start killing people for real ?
suspect zero .
that 's a crackpot theory . everybody says so .
but he believes in it .
i guess i 'm a little paranoid .
what 's going on ?
you were right . he found me .
and you 're working with him ?
i need something tangible . to hook him .
probably .
i 've decided to investigate low 's plane crash .
it 's too late for that .
could be a lot of things .
hardly anyone calls me tom .
you okay ?
yeah , of course .
what 's going on ?
burn marks . the original m.e .
low calls him suspect zero .
suspect zero is a crackpot theory .
that 's what koessler wants us to believe .
i ...
i 've got to take a piss .
it 's a truck . a refrigerated truck .
i 'm going to amarillo .
kulok .
agent kulok , could you wipe my face ?
sit back .
of course he does .
i want to protect the boy .
no weapon .
turn around . stretch your arms over the seat .
i 'll be back .
the little piggie speaks .
i 'll give you a little hint .
yes .
this is richard low . stay on the phone .
yes , sir .
when you exit , head east on 10th .
i 've been reading , hearing about you .
he could n't break an egg with a hammer .
he 's moved on to tv .
he always had a weakness in that area .
i 'm not sure , exactly .
suspect zero ?
so you went underground ?
was i afraid of dave koessler ? not likely .
i do n't carry it with me .
you 're a smart guy .
zero killed them all ?
of course not . they 're possibles .
daitz hinted it existed .
you knew it was me all along ?
please .
i already have an employer .
who told you about her ?
you did .
i know you , lionheart .
maybe you should back off .
you ? you went by the book ?
yeah .
the boy 's okay . i saw him ...
yeah .
whatever happened to mydick ?
something came up , murman , my man .
[ follow me . ]
[ not this way .
if i owe , i will go .
[ the address is 147 south rane .
[ hello , agent mackelway .
[ not the heart , the watch . ]

perhaps you can explain it to him .
murman !
he 's a brilliant man .
brilliant ?
take your shirt off .
shit .
you have to put things in perspective .
i know , i know .
you 've been through worse .
you 're right . i know .
ever since i 've known you .
i do n't know about that .
that 's because it was a challenge .
okay . i 'll think about that . bye .

no . stop , come on .
shuddup .

no ...
you should . a lot of comics play vegas .
oh ? you know about booking agents ...
actually , it 's funny you ...

well that sucks .
it sucks .
so it 's almost a retroactive decision .
right ... wait , what do you mean ?
ah , see , that 's the thing .
there 's the rub .
thanks , man .
... it 's just that you 've been there .
no problem .
i mean , i need the money .
you 're an actor .
it 's definitely a step back for me .
what do you want ? you 're tall .
it 's like `` hi , mom .

i do n't talk about her that much .
oh no ?

where are you from originally , annie ?
san francisco .
how 'd you happen to come here ?
i suspected as much .
you need n't worry .
annie -- there 's nothing between mitch and me .
is n't there ? maybe there is n't .
four years ago .
different ?
with lydia . did she seem a trifle distant ?
a trifle .
then maybe it is n't different at all .
nothing ! i simply existed .
lydia liked me , you see .
because she was afraid .
afraid you 'd take mitch ?
afraid i 'd give mitch .
i do n't understand .
what about mitch ?
i can understand his position .
so it ended . not immediately , of course .
then you know . little girls in brown beanies .
and the second ?
i wanted to be near mitch .
it seems so pointless .
that 's up to you .
yes .
then go .
look .
ohhh . oh , the poor thing .
it 's what you said , mom .
no , cathy .
cathy !
just listen to them !
if your father were here ...
no !
mom , they 're in a cage !
they 're birds !
take them .
yes ?
well , i suppose ...
oh , i suppose so .
could i have a puff ?
i do n't think your mother would like that .
just a little one .
i know .
are you coming to my party ?
i do n't think so .
do n't you like us ?
darling , of course i do !
do n't you like bodega bay ?
i do n't know yet .
mitch likes it very much .
i do n't know , honey .

and the white house ?
that 's where the brenners live .
the brenners ? mr. and mrs. brenner ?
nope , just lydia and the two kids .
the two kids ?
yep . mitch and the little girl .
i see . how do i get down there ?
nope . that 's the road .
mmmm .

of course .
d'you want me to order one for you ?
thank you .
what name ?
daniels .
okay .
yep ?
the little girl 's name .
the little brenner girl ?
yes .
alice , i think .
that case , i tell you what you do .
thank you .
yep . could save yourself a lot of trouble .
can i have the boat in about twenty minutes ?
it 's nothing .
birds are not bad !
young woman cut herself .

i do n't think it 's that serious .
stop worrying , deke .
they 're back !

one apple pie ! you want more coffee ?
no .
no . here 's fine .
where are the bloody marys , deke ?

miss daniels is staying for the weekend .
yes , lovebirds . we could n't let you ...
lovebirds , i see .
i 'll pick you up , miss daniels .
i do n't know what good that 'll do .
whose side are you on ?
i 'm simply quoting the law .

and certainly pretty .
yes .
how long have you known her ?
i told you . we met yesterday .
in a bird shop .
yes .
she was selling birds .
no .
forgive me .
i suppose so .
i know , mother .
perhaps i 'm old-fashioned .
yes ?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself .
well ...
i think he got a little scratch , mother .
that 's right .
when do you think they 'll come ?
i do n't know .
maybe we ought to leave .
not now .
when ?
i do n't know when .
where will we go ?
i do n't know yet .
what happens when we run out of wood ?
you do n't know , you do n't know !
i 'm sorry , mitch .
shhh . shhh .
oh , my god , look at her !

i know you can .
you 're doing fine .
i mean . i want to ...
but they 'll be back .
we wo n't be here .
where can we go , mitch ?
i want to try for san francisco .
we 'd never make it .
we have to try it .
if ...
they wo n't be .
if they are ?
we 'll worry about that when we get there .
i 'm frightened , terribly frightened . i ...
i started to say ... inside ...
you do n't have to .
oh , thank you .
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm .
why ? did n't al believe my story ?
he was calling from the farm , mrs. brenner .
then he saw .
he must have .
what good will they do ?
what ?
cathy . at the school .
do i sound foolish to you ?
no .
i keep seeing dan fawcett 's face .
try not to think of that , mrs. brenner .
i wish i were a stronger person .
annie 's there . she 'll be all right .
i 'm not this way , you know .
yes .
i wish i could be that way .
would you like to rest now , mrs. brenner .
no . no ... do n't go yet .
why , mrs. brenner ?
yes , i think so .
and if you do n't ?
would you like me to go for her ?
i could n't ask you to .
i do n't mind , really .
would you ? i 'd feel so much better .
did you close the door ?
and locked it .
please .
we know what it is , al .
no , i got ta admit this is peculiar .
yes , but the curtains were drawn .
well ... well ... these birds attacked us .
these birds were ...

i think so , sir .

no , sir , those are ... redbirds .
the sign says strawberry finches .
yes , we call them that too .
those are canaries , miss .
does n't what make me ... ?
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this ?
i imagine that 's very important .
yes , that 's a particularly dangerous time .
are they moulting now ?
some of them are .
how can you tell ?
well ... they get a sort of hangdog expression .
all right . she smiles back .
i was merely drawing a parallel , miss daniels .
but how ... how do you know my name ?
a little birdie told me .
hey , wait a minute !
ahhh , but i know you .
how ?
we met in court .
we never met in court or anyplace else .
that 's true . i 'll rephrase it .
when ?
no , but your little prank did .
what are you ? a policeman ?
you knew i did n't work here .
right . i recognized you when i came in .

you were lying .
yes , i was lying .
did you really write a letter to me ?
i wrote the letter .
what did it say ?

because it seemed stupid and foolish .
like jumping into a fountain in rome !
i told you what happened in rome !
do you expect me to believe ... ?
i do n't give a damn what you believe !
why ?
i think it could be fun .
it is for me .
but not for me .

a gull smashed into annie 's front door .
i do n't know , melanie .
no , thank you .
i 'll get it .
are you staying ?
i think i should , do n't you ?
it 's an uprising .
of birds ?
certainly , of birds .
so they united .
not at first .
well , they 'll go along with anything .
sure .
hear !
why should we submit ourselves to their domination ?
hear , hear !
take wing !
you have nothing to lose but your feathers .
mmm ?
they 're probably hungry , that 's all .
it was like that yesterday .
what do you mean ?
after the gulls attacked .
i had n't thought of that .
i 'm frightened , mitch .
no , no ...
i 'm frightened and confused and i ...
... everything i know .
yes .

the past fifteen minutes .
even the birds sitting out there .
i tried a little while ago .
have we still got power ?
yes . i 'm tired , mitch .
inland .
santa rosa ?
maybe .
i thought they 'd have stopped by now .
what time is it ?
almost two a.m .
you must be exhausted .
how about you ?
i do n't want to be safe .
mitch ...
wait here . do n't move .
no ... wait . hold me .
i ... i do n't think so .
what do you suppose it is ?

what ? oh , yes , certainly .
no , you 'd better send him .
yes , certainly .
do you have any lovebirds ?
no , not in the shop .

that would be just fine .
there is very definitely a difference , miss .
they 're different , daddy . thank you .
thank you .
birds are not aggressive creatures , miss .
what were the crows after at the school ?
for what purpose ?
to ... to kill them .
i thought not .
maybe they 're all protecting the species .
maybe ! is it impossible ?
yes .
no one ever said you were , mitch .
i think we 're in trouble .
no . i do n't , mitch .
it 's happening .
i like bodega bay as well as any man .
then help me , sebastian .
help how ? what do you want to do ?
i 'm not sure , but ...
mrs. bundy , you said something about santa cruz .
with smoke .
yeah , birds .
we need them .
not if they 're starting a war .
they are incapable of organized warfare !
... probably contain more than a hundred billion birds !
which gulls , mr. sholes ?
then let 's go . now !
i have n't finished my drink .
put on your coats !
take it easy , lady .
ca n't you please finish your drink ?
all right , all right !
that 's right . gray , the cabman .
but ca n't you give me any idea ?
how could i ? i will do my best .
good .
i want you to help my little girl .
i 'm only a student .
georgina told me how kind you were to her .
of course i will .
yes .
good morning , mr. fettes .
i ca n't do that -- you heard macfarlane .
save yourself .
he 's a great doctor -- a great man --
i 'm cold as ice .
gray has no need to threaten .
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums .
where can i find him ?
you do n't went to find him .
at pennycuik . i know the inn .
come in , boy -- come in .
excuse me .
i 'm afraid i have to , sir .
well ? and are you not a good student ?
but richardson ?
richardson is a fine student .
i 'm sorry for the woman , fettes .
she came again today .
so she told me .
look here , fettes .
wilmont used up the last spinal section .
gray killed her .
we ca n't be sure of that .
i am sure . i mean to report it .
grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder .
believe it or not .
who would believe that ?
pulse ?
he has his own idea of a joke .
i 've just been to see mrs. marsh .
but she must want to stand .
what do you mean , fettes ?
i 'll have no more to do with it .
gray -- i 'm rid of him --
tosh ! fettes !
you could n't do that , doctor .
no .
why not ? i must have subjects .
no room there .
it was a woman when we put her in .
not yet .
you 'll be a good doctor .
well --
the white horse .
maybe there 's another reason .
i want it --
i ca n't .
i am not at the school anymore .
i wanted to see the white horse --
a doctor ?
a student .
do n't call me that confounded name .
medicine ? that 'll keep . sit down .
why do n't you do it then ?
oh , yes , you will .
no .
that 's a good boy , toddy .
that has nothing to do with it .
you 're uncommon friendly tonight , toddy .
i 've had some experience .
i am a doctor . i teach medicine .
like knox taught you ? like i taught you ?
the heart pumps it .
but what makes a thought start ?
in the brain , i tell you .
i 'll tell you what , toddy .
this is a gift .
i take no gifts from you .
this is a gift you 'll not return .
get out of here !
wait , toddy . that 's not hospitable .
i 've drunk enough tonight .
another little drop 'll never do you any harm .
the resurrection business ?
i would make you rich .
a pleasure to torment me ?
i want to speak to you alone .

i know that you kill people to sell bodies .
no , joseph .
no digging joseph .

i never heard that song .
that was hare 's end .
we could do that .
no , doctor .
nearly a year .
any attacks of pain since ?
yes , doctor .
is her pain sporadic or constant ?
it comes at intervals .
a carriage overturned .
how long ago ?
three years .
she would if she could .
then all my surgery is no good .
aye . he 's a good lad .
you think it 'll spoil the boy , eh ?
aye --
did it spoil me , meg , my lass ?
you can get out .
i 'll get him .
he must leave me alone .
aye .
where are they ?
can i get you something ?
where are they ? last chance .

i 'm looking for my friends .

i guess it 's true .

i talked to most of them this morning ...
good .
he 'll be there at 8:30 .
that 's good , hilda . i 'm glad .
yes -- that is true .
what about your personal safety in the meantime ?
i 'm afraid you have no alternative .
i assure you such power exists .
yes .
that can easily be arranged .
maybe a little demonstration .
something dramatic -- but not destructive .
hello , darling . good evening , mr. carpenter .
boy , we had a swell time .
yeah , sure .
okay .
what do you mean , dear ?
no , dear , of course not .
i could n't go to sleep , mom .

department of commerce . she 's a secretary .
i should n't be at all surprised .
well -- atomic power , i would imagine .
i thought that was only for bombs .
no .
i do n't know , bobby .
mr. carpenter -- what does velocity mean ?
velocity is the time rate of change of position .
would n't you like to meet him ?
it 's a problem in celestial mechanics .
sure .
no -- i 'm afraid not .
is it different where you 've been ?
they have cemeteries .
all right .
no foolin ' ? will you ?
certainly .
some places that 's what people use for money .
she does n't like me to steal from people .
mr. brady 's a cop .
goodnight .
i 'll say goodnight again .
yeah -- sure .
why -- the light in my room went out .
oh , i 'd say forty-five .
he told me this morning when i examined him .
i do n't believe it .
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty .
how does he explain that ?
he says their medicine is that much more advanced .
sit down , mr. harley .
about five months -- your months .
you must have come a long way .
about 250 million of your miles .
i mean the reasons for my coming here .
we 're very curious about that , too .
i 'd be glad to .
i -- i 'm not sure i understand --
you know about the united nations ?
you must have a rather strange impression of us .
i intend to explain .
thank you ... have you any news ?
not very good news , i 'm afraid .
i can judge only by what i see .
your impatience is quite understandable .
i am impatient with stupidity .
i 'm afraid my people have n't .
you still have n't answered my question .
you know how i feel , tom .
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow .
you ready ?
i will be in just a minute .
the picture starts at eight-fifty .
i was talking to mr. carpenter .
i 'm sorry .

looks real to me .
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight .
all right , tom -- it 's true .
how do you know ?
never mind about that .
you do n't understand .
important ? of course it 's important .
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .
but he is n't a menace !
is that what you 're thinking about ?
why not ?
you wait and see .
i 'm not going to marry anybody .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
jittery is the word .
he 's a fine boy , mrs. benson .
naturally i think so .
goodnight , mr. carpenter .
goodnight , my dear .
may i see you for a minute ?
i -- i was just going to lunch .

i 'd give you a very good price .
but i suppose you know the answer .
it 's really quite simple ...
no -- i 'm afraid not .
well , how do i know who you are ?

what for ?
who else could have used that key ?
right . half of us awake at all times .
macready , that you ?
yeah !
it 's the generator i think ! no power .
well , let 's get down there .
he 's one of them .
when do you think it got to him ?
hear what ?
what ? !
it 's in between us and them ! !
ca n't hear you .
the journey is part of my work .
i had an accident .
i figured that . what kind of accident ?
on the towers ?
i 'm training to be a high climber .
do n't tell me you 're a mud carrier .
'fraid so .
exactly like you .
i 'm so sorry , kalen .
the hall of books .
you have books ? !
i should n't have mentioned it .
what kind of stories ?
about the voice in the darkness .
what happened ?
he came back screaming ...
no ...
please , just listen to me ...
but you 're only a mud carrier .
this is it ?
around here .
but there 's nothing here .
how did you know ? !
1899 .
i must say , you look remarkably good .
what are you ?
i 'm the librarian .
morlocks --
you know of them ?
who does n't know the morlocks ?
do you know where they live ?
oh yes ...
i was lucky . the others were n't .
how have you survived so long ?
why should i help you ?
excuse me ?
you 'll live like this forever . alone .
yes .
last night .
send him away .
what ?
send him home .
kalen ... hold on a minute .
it frightens you .
yes ...
it was meant to .
yes .
are n't you a plucky little -- ?
oh , shut up .
this is the way in ?
yes ... thank you .
yes .
do you know which way ?
this way .
the air ... the power .
why did they built it ?
the morlocks did n't build this .
how are your dreams now ?
end ... ?
this has to end .
nothing to do , i 'm afraid .
vox ...
i 'm babbling .
i wo n't leave you like this .
go back to the light .
i do n't understand .
i 'm going to end it , alexander .
i will ...
alexander .
no , we created the morlocks .
created ?
you would n't understand .
to work the machines and build the tunnels .
how do you control the morlocks ?
we make them see what we wish .
how ?
as our bodies atrophied our minds ... compensated .
they survived above . became what they are .
i 'm afraid your indignation is lost here .
but this is barbaric !
and who are you , alexander ?
it ca n't all be like this ...
go back to where you came from .
why would you let me go back ?
because the past is immutable . frozen .
i could tell them .
we have lost the capacity to reproduce .
so you take their best ...
you took her because she helped me .
yes .
a man can change his history .
no ...
i 'm a foolish man .
does this prove something to you ?
oh , you wo n't be running for long ...
i do n't think that 's going to happen .
and why not ?
because ...
thanks . old nell 's my girl all right .

perseverance .
i 'm sorry , david .
it hurt me , alex . very much .

but you wo n't listen .
you know that 's what it is .
i care more about my life . and yours .
i live with it every minute of every day .
i know that --
you do n't know that .
was n't it ? ...
what is it ?
you would n't believe me .

how long ago ?
more than 800,000 years .
why not ?
why would you do that ?
yes . or forward into the future .
just a dream . you should sleep too .
i will ...
thank you ...
you can see so many here .

yes !
we all have that dream .
all of you ?
every night .

we share everything .
thank you .
and this is your `` work '' ?
yes .
i can see kalen 's point .
i do n't understand .
i mean , why do you do it ?
it has no purpose . it 's just beautiful ...
most things . we 're very high on purpose .
it 's always been this way here .
and there 's no shame to that .
i 'm a planner .
you liked it there .
oh , very much ... ...

of course . you 're just tired .
i suppose so .
we do n't know .

but the jacket ?
we never should have done this to him ...
[ beat ] so they say .
i 'm just looking at you .
depends on what you 're seeing .
are you kidding me ? he 's not psychotic !
then how would you describe him , beth ?
[ uncertainly ] in that thing ... the jacket .
actually , that 's exactly what our equipment is .
i do n't give a shit about your patient !
i was n't pausing to see if you did .
maybe not .
sit down , mr. starks !
it is .
my business ?
yes .
getting away with things .
i 've managed to every sunday of my life .
you in here .
i think you know .
[ beat ] you 're his son ?
no . i 'm not his son .
how ... how are you here ?
i know .
no , we were patients .
you just told me .
i do n't understand ...
i 'm in it as we speak .
i did n't put you in alpine grove .
no .
you may have known my father , william starks .
he did n't either .
oh yeah , sure .
oh yeah , what 'd he say ?
i thought you said you never knew your father .
i did n't .
i never touched your father ! i swear !
they should just be looking harder .
later . i 'll tell you about it later .
i am .
sure .

what ?
i do n't know .
yes .
i know .
alpine grove still exists .
i know .
how ?
no . they never figured it out .

i do n't know .
they told me becker 's in shelbourne now .
here , drink this .
yeah .
they 're not .
[ beat , lost ] no .
there 're no cars on this street .

then , where are you going ?
nowhere .
good . how 's your mom ?
ok , i guess .
you 're bleeding pretty bad there .
i fell down .
i 'm doing fine .
i guess i 'd ask you why .
because i do n't think i 'm crazy .
you 're not crazy .
that conviction does n't convince me of anything .
i could try to ... make it stop .
no . i do n't want it to .
so it 's helping ?
i never knew my father . did you ?
yeah , i did .
why ?
i was working with a boy named eugene .
[ beat ] i do n't know .
my dad wrote some things down before he died .
you have no idea what 's going on .
no , i do .
listen to me ! you do n't !
then help me understand .
come on . tell me what you do know .
2004 .
it does n't look all that different .
the future does n't look different ?
no . not for people like me .
maybe .
because i do n't have time .
why not ?
because of the future .
you told me about him .
you told me this was how it happened .
i did ?
yeah .
you have nothing to fear , william .
you still do n't believe me , do you ?
i do believe you ...
no .
you did , in the future .

tv .
do n't you go to jail for that ?
i tried something like 30 times .
i was n't talking about anything .

it was jerry nathan 's .
he owes god money .
she left me . crabs .
left you ... ? who ? emily ?
this morning .
but .
oh , i 'm sure you 'll find another .
primarily .
i 'm sure . where is everyone ?
sara and walter declined .
i know . he started it fall semester .
he finished it winter break .
no . not yet he is n't .
well , i 'm going to read it anyway .
come on . crabs . do n't do this .
he is . take my word for it .
i think it 's more complicated than that .
shut up and drink .
huh uh . a jockey .
vernon , then . vernon hardapple .
and now he 's addicted to painkillers .
he ca n't piss standing up anymore .
he lives with his mother .
because ... because ...
he heard everything we were saying .
tripp .
yes .
hit your brakes .
just go around him .
back up . go out the other way .
where would we go ?
shit .
what ? ohhhh . is that ... it ?
think , hannah . does james have any friends .
james ? my james ? what 's happened ?
his parents .
good god . let 's go rescue him .
good idea , crabs . only one problem .
ah . wait a minute .
it 's a little late to call admissions .
is it a little late to call the chancellor ?
maybe ... i do n't know .
only in your bones ?
bad enough .
competence .
what 's to tell ?
plenty , i 'm sure .
i told you .
so sensitive .
oh , come on , tripp .
it 's just ail that crap he spins out .
ye-es ?
so what 's the problem ?
there is no problem .
the chancellor 's here ? now ?
evidently . coming !
great .
find the jacket .
oh ! huh .
do n't touch it .
my guess -- vernon hardapple .
the hood jumper ?
'that 's my car , motherfucker . '
uh huh . so .
... we find the jacket .
there 's only one problem , tripp .
no wonder he screwed us over .
call it a hunch .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
you 'll be all right then .
that was maccaulay .
or hemingway , when hadley lost all those stories .
he was never able to reproduce them .
bad examples .
in a sense .
i do n't think so .
oh , right . oola . about that jacket ...
ah . well . congratulations .
do you know he wo n't expel him ?
no . but i do n't think that matters .
that 's very enlightened , professor .
gee , i do n't know , crabs ...
i peeked .
jeff . sorry .
oh , professor tripp ?
hey , jeff .
excuse me ?

spiro t. agnew was vice president , i believe .
that 's probably not the problem , then .
i 've been trying to finish a book ...
and your wife left you .
is that in my chart ?
i spoke with the woman who saved your life .
you need to see a doctor , mr. tripp .
her dog , yes .
actually , it was her husband 's dog ...
better luck next time .
so is my friend ... is sara still here ?
no . there 's no one here .
i have to see her .
move away , cupcake .
who 's got a gun ?
you 've got a gun , motherfucker .

shut up . cupcake . please . inside .
bullshit .
no , really ...
'fraid so .
shoot .
no sweat . only do me a favor ?
sure .
stop calling me vernon .
grady , it 's sara .
could you hold on a minute , honey ?
where are you , grady ? an elevator ?
i 'm in kinship .
yes . but that 's not why i called ...
with emily ?
what ? no . there 's no one here .
just what ? doing a little dusting ?
are you there to not reconcile with her ?
no . sara , you do n't understand ...
trust me , i understand .
... you carry firearms .
no ! what gave you that idea ?
relax , james . i 'm not her father .
huh ? oh . son of fury .
she went crazy , frances farmer .
so did gene tierney .
sounds like a good one .
it 's not bad .
it does n't matter .
really ? that 's remarkable .
i have trouble sleeping .
a little .
so what are you doing out here ?
it 's colder in there .
you 're right .
heaven ?
i saw a movie once .
i 'll miss my bus .
this is worth it .
that 's really it .
the one she wore on her wedding day ?
so i 'm told .
really ?
really .
like the lady herself .
i guess .
maybe .
yes . well . it 's complicated , james .
i had to . did n't i ?
could n't you 've just pulled him off me ?
no ! he was crazy .
okay , okay . take it easy .
yea , james .

what 's he saying ?
mmrrmmm ... knap sap !
you 're welcome .
i put you on the floor .
oh .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
there is , but it 's not that interesting .
sure .
who ?
the guy on the phone .
what 'd he say ?
yes .
good , james .
that 's a big book you 're writing .
blocked .
ah .
hm .
how did i get here last night ?
and ... and before that .
well done , james .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
there is , but it 's not that interesting .
so where have you been staying ?
the bus station .
a couple weeks .
jesus , james , you should 've told someone .
who ?
i do n't know ... me .
hm .
yeah , well , actually ...
your aunt ?
maybe ...
it 's my father .
glaucoma ?
colon cancer .
jesus , james . wow .
where 's that ?
carvel .
carvel ? where 's carvel ?
outside scranton .
i never heard of it .

she came here . we 'll just wait .
it 's not that .
oh . right .
i know .
i just wanted a little sip ?

i do n't know , james .
not you . your talent .
the hell i am .
yes you are . my stuff stinks .
i never said that .

i did n't mean it that way .
it 's okay , professor tripp .
i 'm sorry .
and do n't be so goddamn sensitive .
arsonist 's daughter meant something .

when nobody 's looking .
okay .
nowhere . you just sit here and ... eat .
james . listen .
i 'm not going , with them .
six . their plane went down right outside scranton .
near carvel ?
i 'm sorry about all that .
that 's why she hates me .
ah , wear whatever you want .
i 'm a little worried , james .
do n't be .
yes , james .
even if i end up going to jail ... .
i think maybe we 're missing the point .
i think so ... what about you ?
me ? sure . why ?
just checking .
ail right .
the answer 's yes . i think . yes .
james 'll know about george sanders .
and i love the inscription you wrote to me .

james is odd .

oh . well . i ...
grady !

terry was telling me about you on the plane .
lucky guess .

you 're a good man , walter .
you do n't have to tell me this .
i 'm just talking , man .
carlos , i never raped a woman .
i know . i 'm just saying i understand .
maybe because you 're looking her in the face .
sure .
nothing .
ask me . ask me anything .
i mean ... feelings .
birds .
there 's a million birds here .
in that birch tree is a nest .
sure .
is that right ?
i do n't like starlings .
why not ?
they 're extremely aggressive birds .
the mother sure has her hands full .
when i go bird-watching .
it 's just a city park .
a solitary vireo . i like that one .
their sound is quite musical .
how does it sound ?
it 's hard to describe .
try .
i ca n't .
i bet you can .
it 's a bright sound .
that was terrific .
you should hear the bird .
you live around here ?
not too far . are you a bird-watcher too ?
me ? nah .
were you watching me ?
not at first .
do you come here often ?
my daddy likes me home before dark .
it 's good to listen to your daddy .
not yet .
it 's my bird book .
i have friends .
well ... not in the common way .
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked .
cop .

i have no idea .
i think you do .
why do n't you just tell me ?
then you wo n't mind if i look around .
i would .
got something to hide ?

i could get a search warrant .
yeah .
unusual design for a contemporary piece .

i fell asleep .
yes .
fairy tales ?

no .
neither do i .
woodsman ?
the one with the ax ?
i do n't know .
sure you do .
that 's it .
what ?
the girl .

i 'll be asking the questions .
no .
a man was badly beaten across the street .
i was asleep .
i did n't say what time the assault occurred .
you said last night .
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty .
i went to bed around seven .
i could take you downtown .
you could .
i have a passionate girlfriend .
what 's with the boxes ?
you 're a cop . figure it out .
i 'd say you 're moving .
it 's a free country , is n't it ?
yes .
then i 'd say you 're a lucky fellow .
i count my blessings .
well , i guess i 'll be seeing you .
'fraid not .
i 'm adjusting okay .
and your new apartment ?
apartment 's okay .
are you taking your medication ?
it gives me headaches .
but you are taking it ?
yeah .
you are in .
what ?
the new man .
lovers ' quarrel ?

no you 're not .
i will be in three months .
do you have many friends ?
no .

banished ... yeah .
birds are my friends .
yes ?
would you like to sit on my lap ?
would you like to sit on my lap ?
no thank you .
are you sure ?
i 'm sure . thank you all the same .
that 's okay ... does n't matter .
do you want me to sit on your lap ?
they sound like finches .
they could be finches . i do n't know .
does he ?
yes .
do you like it when he asks you ?
ms. kramer .
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does .
i ca n't .
yes you can , robin .
what will happen if i do ?
someone will talk to your daddy .
your daddy will always love you .
how do you know ?
robin , listen to me .
yes ?
i do n't mind .
you should go home .
ca n't i stay a little longer ?
it 's getting dark . go home .
will i see you again ?
the job 's okay .
that 's right , you did .
i 'm not running for mr . popularity .
you seem a little hostile today .
that was a joke .
no need to call me doctor .
it 's all the same .
i 'd like you to keep a journal .
a diary ?
that 's right .
no way .
why not ?
diaries have sent too many guys to prison .
i do n't understand .
ev-i-dence .
oh . it never crossed my mind .
of course .
it was just an idea .
bad idea .
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect .
reflect .
that 's right .
you think reflection is good .
it 's very good , indeed .
how 's that ?
no fucking way .
then think about it .
i 'm still thinking about it .
i wish you 'd give it a try .
it 's okay .
but you do n't like coming here .
honest ? no .
good . that 's an honest answer .
honest ? your cheery personality makes my skin itch .
maybe it 's the way i look .
rosen ?
i do n't need someone else .
i do n't feel anything .
you have no feelings for your niece ?
she was born after they put me away .
then why are you talking about this ?
have to talk about something .
what are you afraid will happen ?
i 'm not afraid .
i 'm not that crazy .
do you think you 're crazy ?
you know why .
is that what you are angry about ?
talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round .
that is a marvelous image , walter .
we have a few more minutes .
i mean , when will i be normal .
we have a lot of work to do .
will i ever be normal ?
i could n't say .
you could n't say .
i 'm afraid not .
do you know what `` normal '' is ?
i suppose it 's however society defines it .
how do you define it ?
i do n't .
how do they know ?
what is your idea of being normal ?
what is your idea of being a jew ?
i want to be normal !
i know --
you do n't know !
i know you 're frustrated , walter , but --
what did you think would happen ?
i do n't know .
what did you want to happen ?
i do n't know !
is this the first one ?
of course it is !
i want you to calm down .
i want to talk about it now .
we 'll talk about it more on thursday .
now i know .
sorry .
please do n't do it again .
i said i was sorry .
you mean my problem ?
that 's not a helpful answer .
that 's my answer .
what ?
i 'd like you to close your eyes .
why ?
to relax .
i 'm relaxed .
close your eyes and let your mind be blank .
hey , rosen , you going to hypnotize me ?
okay . eyes closed , mind a blank .
no .
in your mind , walter . take your time .
i see my sister .
not so fast .
sorry . where is she ?
in my bedroom , sleeping .
where ?
in my bed , rosen .
where are you ?
in my bed too .
how old are you and your sister ?
we 're little kids .
but roughly , how old ?
just lying there . we 're taking a nap .
a nap ?
yes , a nap . kids do that .
did you and your sister often take naps together ?
i want you back in your chair !
all right .
i do n't like nobody behind my back !
i 'm sorry .
did you touch her ?
this is garbage !
i 'm only asking questions .
what else ?
that 's all .
you felt pleasure .
yes .
i was six years old !
i meant later ... when you two took naps .
all right .
i smelled her hair . that 's it .
accept you ?
time .
how do you feel about that ?
i feel ... okay .
are you okay ?
yeah , i 'm fucking fantastic .
i 'm all right .
it 's fucking freezing out here .
what picture ?
i 'm talking about you .
me ?
yeah , you .
people without cars .
most women would n't choose it .
guess i 'm not like most women .
i 'm just quiet .
you do n't hang out with the other guys .
neither do you .
they 're all assholes .
i thought you were a dyke .
what do you think ?
what ?
your windows face south .
i 'll buy a plant .
you should buy several .
sorry .
k through sixth .
does n't it get noisy ?
i like the noise .
my place faces a truck street .
i go backpacking a lot .
what about them ?
they could eat you .
yeah , they could .
you 're damaged .
yeah ?
i get that impression .
so ... what 's your dark secret ?
why do you want to know ?
what ?
not tonight .
you 're still here .
i did n't say i did n't enjoy it .
of course . sorry .
no you 're not .
you think i have a problem ?
do you ?
it 's been a while since ...
since you 've had sex ?
maybe later .
how about in the morning .
the morning ?
i thought i 'd stay the night .
what for ?
i suffer from insomnia .
is that all ?
when i do sleep , i sweat a lot .
i sleep like a dead horse . anything else ?
hi .
because i like you .
the worst ?
yeah .
i molested little girls .
molested little girls ?
yeah .
twelve years in prison is no joke .
how many girls did you molest ?
what did you do to them ?
it 's not what you think .
how young ?
between ten and twelve .
twelve years in prison ?
the judge had a thing about sex offenders .
i told you i 'm not easily shocked .
you should be shocked .
what ?
get your kicks somewhere else .
hey , i 'm not --
depraved ? my mistake .
walter .
you do n't really --
yes ! i want to know .
no . prison is time . that 's it .
do n't be sorry for me .
sounds like a special guy .
why young girls , walter ?
their power . they seduce me .
they seduce you ?
i was always the one seduced .
you really believe that ?
no .
and what do you tell yourself now ?
nothing . it 's over .
bullshit .
what ?
being here , with me .
i know .
most people say the odds are against me .
what odds ?
the percentages --
well , most people are stupid .
why not tell me now ?
which brother did this ?
all three -- in chronological order .
you must hate your brothers .
i love my brothers .
no you do n't .
i love all of them .
are you serious ?
not ever ?
not ever .
what ?
us seeing each other .
i 'm not scared .
neither am i .
maybe you should be .
live together .
move in with me .
i think it 's a fucking good idea .
i 've got problems .
who does n't ?
most people do n't have my kind of problems .
guess that makes you pretty special .
that 's not what i meant .
fine .
what 's it look like ?
everyone needs a plant .
you 're such an asshole .
i 'm not scared .
prove it .
do what ?
sneak up behind me like that .
what 's your fucking problem ?
why 's it always my fucking problem ?
nothing .
do you want to talk about it ?
i need a shower .
yeah .
fucking liar .
not when they fly .
piece of cake , baby .
where 're you ?

and why did you drop them ?
what ! get married ?
yes . we 'll get married .
what do i say ? what can i say ?
so , you wonder why ?
okay . in a few minutes .
nothing .
why ?
no reason why ...
no , sandro ... we should go .
are n't you going to change ?
you said you wanted to quit working for ettore .

late , very late .
good night . tell me that you love me .
i love you .
tell me once more .
i do n't love you .
i deserve it .
oh no ; quite the contrary .
not really ...
calm ? ...
it was futile . we went all over .
you say that just to flatter me .
do you consider that a compliment ?
no .
but then why did you bother changing ?
quieter ? oh , yes , of course .
you should n't always take me seriously .
it means being without money .
i imagine he must be inside sleeping .
would you please see if sandro is with him ?
more or less , we are all afraid .
i 'm afraid that anna has come back .
yes , you 're right .
to the shark .
but for what reason should i come there ?
it could n't be any clearer .
i detest comparisons made with oil .
there 's a shark in the area .
who 's moving ?
but why ? ...
what do you think ?
we , too , you know .
there too ...
then let 's get started ...
we 'll try again .
what is it ?
nothing , nothing at all .
and you expect to find him in here ?
yes , yes , of course .
ask her .
i know we are .
anybody can hold a brush in his hand .
here i am .
oh , there are as many as one wants .
i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays .
but how could they pose like that ?
why do n't you try ?
me ... goffredo , you 're mad !
answer me , why do n't you try posing ?
but why me ? ...
i appeal to you more ?
yes , sir .
now , we 're getting somewhere !
i ... i ... was n't feeling well ... i..
yes , she takes care of the garden .
then it 's impossible for her to know me .
no , not like this one .
and why would n't we have one like this ?
because this is a chinese radio .
unfortunately , no .
very well .
thank you .
do n't mention it ...
no . the owners are in australia .
but where did you come from ?
from panarea . why ?

what do you want us to do ?
i 'll go and get my valise .

you know , i do n't love anybody .

the machine will bring his temperature down .
good .
good . get on it .
got a better idea ?
oh my god .
does anybody know what happened ?
it 's time for drastic remedies .
right . we 've got a lot to accomplish .
no ... the risk is too great .
let me go first ; you stay behind me .
i ca n't , the acid will pour out !
i 've completely lost their signal .
can you get them back ?
i 'm trying .
the computer just translated the goddamn message .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
we 're not going anywhere .
but they do n't know about the translation !
we ca n't spare the personnel .
why , you chickenshit bastard --
just can that crap !
how many ?
three blips ! they 're coming this way !
jay , this is cleave !
what is it -- i ca n't tell anything --
i think it 's fizzled out .
hey ! what about the film ?
listen , had n't somebody better check on broussard ?
we sure need this flamethrower .
and the creature with it .
our lives are more important .
it 's not going to work .
i should hope so !
feast your eyes .
sandy , can you home in on that beam ?
what 's the frequency ?
computer , what 's the frequency of the transmission ?
well ... this rock rotates every two hours .
sorry .
all right .
you lead .
my signal 's fading .
how far ?
we should be almost on top of it .
who knows ?
but what can we do ?
maybe we should just wait a few more minutes .
can you see anything ?
what is it ?
how the hell should i know ?
yes , thank heaven .
we 're just plain lucky .
is it still dripping ?
it appears to have healed itself .
we 're going into the freezers now .
maybe we could write it together .
room by room , corridor by corridor .
we 'll have to trap it somehow .
we came out there , we 'll go back .
we 're the new pioneers , chaz .
they 're on the next level up .
let 's get moving with this net .
okay .
look --
could be some kind of venom , or poison ...
yeah ?
they never made it off the planet .
sandy , contact traffic control .
let 's hear it .
computer , you have signalled a priority three message .
well , it 's finally happened .
no -- that 's atmosphere . cloud layer .
turn on navigation lights .
engine room , what happened ?
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter .
good ! moisture content ?
zero . dry as a bone .
any microorganisms ?
not a one . it 's dead .
anything else ?
yeah , rock particles . dust .
good . i 'm getting you clear too .
found what ?
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft .
i agree .
but ?
what killed it ?
oh well ... you know me .
i 've always respected your opinion , martin .
tell you what , martin .
yeah , we hear you !
thank christ ! we lost you !
ca n't talk now ; broussard 's injured .
good .
he went into the pyramid alone .
they seem native to the planet .
up one kilometer , jay .
let 's take her into an escape orbit .
you bet we made it .
even simple .
we 've got it up here !
where are you ?
food-storage room !
we 're coming !
i guess we open the door and net it .
what do you think ? now we go in .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
... more spores coming .
can we get to him ?
at least we 're rid of the damn monster .
that kind of remark is pointless .
okay .
yeah ... i forgot .
what did it do to you ?
look ...
i 'll get you out of there .
no ... do n't ...
kill me ...
sure .
it 's nothing , doc .
do you want a tablet ?
yeah ...
well , just keep looking .
is it dead ?
no , it 's still breathing .
bloody big if it is . top 's open .
wait a minute .
thanks .
good argument for gun-control .
nah .
oh man ...
yep ...
okay , give me the numbers .
a three-second burn to port , on my mark .
it 's on the board .
what 's happening ?
cassie , thank christ ! we 're under attack .
we 're what ! ?
too many .
what ? what 's wrong ? what is it ?
comin ' up the central reservoir .
quick !
and ?
drains right into the central reservoir .
get her on-line . now !
keep trying !
shit . when ?
yesterday .
you win some , you loose some .
we ran a trajectory simulation .
match it !
the door 's sealed from inside .
nooooo !
has anybody talked to them ?
not yet .
do it .
alright , let 's keep calm .
about thirty minutes .
but ...
one more sweep ... one more sweep .
hey !
that 's what i mean .
yeah ?
next time you have a thought like that ?
i dunno .
what ?
take a look at this .
that 's impossible , man .
what ?
just got a reading ...
i 've seen this mother , de vries .
forget it , man .
c'mon de vries . think of the bonus .
fuck the bonus . i hate heights .
hey , fair enough .
what ?
i 'll come with you .
anything you say , mammacitta .
yeah , i got it .
it 's moving slow . about ... eleven metres .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm picking up another signal .
just behind us , over to the right .
yeah , i ...
how ?
i dunno . might be a glitch .
it 's alright , it 's cool ...
is it still moving ?
thanks .
york just turned up outside .
where does that lead to ?
one final point .
nah .
uh-huh .
sounds great .
and , nothing . they checked out just fine .
just give them the facts .
compensate !
punch me in a solution for their delta-vee .
looks like it .
well ... try the headset .
what ? why ?
forget it .
right .
right . auto-shop , you all set ?
blow those suckers , driscoll !
no , not really .
uh-huh . used to get it pretty bad .
four .
and before that ?
six month stint on datus .
only six ?
what is this ? 'twenty questions ' ?
just curious .
real man ' drink .
want some ?
nothing .
sure . do me good to stretch my legs .
do you think ackland 'll sit tight ?
check out the tent .
hold on ...
ah , do n't worry about i.c.c .
what do you mean ?
again ?
ackland ?
alright .
what do i think ?
i 'm out of ammo .
detour . other way 's blocked ...
do n't wait for me !
what can i do ?
i can ... feel it moving around inside me .
i ... i ca n't !
you have to ...
no !
yeah , exactly .
tactical nukes , maybe ?
yeah , 'good evening ' to you , too .
'bout five minutes .
give me a yell is something happens .
you got it , cowboy .
miss harrington 's resting , mr. dewitt .
we wo n't disturb her rest .
it 's a very famous name , mr. dewitt .
and what is your name ?
phoebe .
phoebe ?
i call myself phoebe .
why not ?
certainly , mr. dewitt ...
it 's not modesty .
a revolutionary approach to the theater .
please do .
even so .
it need n't be .
i am somebody .
let 's have a minimum of pretending .
i 'm not enough for a paragraph .
- perhaps more than one .
san francisco .
yes . the shubert .
a fine old theater , the shubert .
eddie what ?
you take charge .
i believe i will .
just some coffee .
i 'm not surprised .
nothing of the kind .
heart to heart ? woman to woman ?
just like that .
it was n't meant to be .
d-day .
just like it .
are you that sure of tomorrow ?
are n't you ?
frankly - yes .
you know me better than that .
paved with what , then ?
stars .
almost four .
why not ?
did i say killer ? i meant champion .
max is paying for it .
lloyd .
we 're ?
lloyd and i .
she 's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd .
what else ?
it 's nothing of the kind !
i 'm in love with lloyd !
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america-
you have no right to say such things !
- and artistically , the most promising !
she does n't know .
you sat and talked until it was light ...
we sat and talked , addison .
i never intended you to be .
yes , you did . you still do .
- it 's important right now that we talk .
champion to champion .
not with me , you 're no champion .
more plainly and more distinctly ?
everything .
i ca n't believe my ears ...
a dull cliche .
belong - to you ?
what of it ?
it is true that your parents were poor .
what of it ?
answer my question !
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago .
yes , addison .
take your nap , now .
could n't go on ?
you can have one at max 's .
i do n't think i 'm going .
why not ?
because i do n't want to .
it 's the same thing , is n't it ?
exactly . here .
you 're being childish .
very well .
you have a point .
i do n't want to make trouble .
you have me confused with dan dailey .
miss caswell is an actress .
that 's how you met me . in passing .
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits ?
because that is what they are .
like i just swam the english channel .
that 's all television is , my dear .
we all have abnormality in common .
and too many of them are produced .
then you 've heard too .
i was there . an eyewitness .
you were there ?
a happy coincidence .
margo ? lunching in public ?
it 's new margo .
dear margo .
i do not . how do you do ?
we have that in common .
then you two must have a long talk-
amen .
being violently ill to her tummy .
it 's good luck before an audition .
over ? it ca n't be .
the audition was called for 2:30 .
is it really ?
naturally enough , your understudy .
eve ! my understudy ...
did n't you know ?
of course i knew .
it just slipped your mind .
frankly , i do n't remember .
just slipped your mind .
completely .
i take it she read well .
it was n't reading , it was a performance .
in time she 'll be what you are .
a mass of music and fire .
huh ?
this is eve harrington .
where ?
right here . a minute ago .
that 's nice .
geniuses do n't need good luck . i do .
everything ... everything 's so funny ...
thank you so much .
show me a human and i might have !
i 'm a junk yard .
heaven help me , i love a psychotic .
where 's my coat ?
like a nylon lemon peel-
eve . i 'd forgotten they grew that way ...
huh ?
do n't get stuck on some glamour puss-
i 'll try .
am i going to lose you , bill ?
as of this moment you 're six years old ...
call me when you get in ...
bill ? have i gone crazy , bill ?
you 're my girl , are n't you ?
that i am ...
then you 're crazy .
when - when are you coming back ?
sure !
and who remembered it ?
i get a party , do n't i ?
how is eve ? okay ?
okay .
i love you ...
i 'll check with eve ...
what ?
i love you too . good night , darling-
see you ...
it wo n't play .
cut it out .
this is my house , not a theater !
to put me to bed ?
you 've heard it .
when i 'm guest of honor ?
i had no idea you were even here .
it 's a pretty rare quality these days .
she 's a girl of so many rare qualities .
so she seems .
so you 've pointed out , so often .
thirty minutes , forty minutes ! what of it ?
for instance - you !
- guilty .
mad !
nothing , really ...
you know nothing about feelings , natural or unnatural .
everybody has a heart - except some people .
what 's all over ?
the audition .
eve ? how enchanting ...
you would n't understand . how was miss caswell ?
so full of meaning , fire and music !
who ?
the kid . junior .
gone .
i must have frightened her away .
i would n't be surprised .
poor little flower .
do n't mix your metaphors .
i mix what i like .
okay . mix .
i 'm nothing but a body with a voice .
what a body , what a voice .
the ex-ship news ' reporter .
the gong rang . the fight 's over .
i will not calm down !
do n't calm down .
you 're being terribly tolerant , are n't you ?
i 'm trying terribly hard .
well , you need n't .
here we go ...
you 've been all through that with lloyd-
paranoiac !
it 's time you found out .
i 've been aware of that for some time .
well , i am .
i 'll say .
do n't be condescending .
come on , get up .
the terms are too high . unconditional surrender .
just being happy ?
i wish it were .
then what would be enough ?
that suddenly makes the whole thing believable .
but you may quote me as follows . quote .
he does not exaggerate . i was good .
you were great .
glory hallelujah .
i understand she is now the understudy in there .
pass me the empty bottle .
what would you like ? texas ?
i want everybody to shut up about eve .
you know why i forgive eve ?
groom .
yes , dear .
you know what i 'm going to be ?
a cowboy .
a married lady .
with the paper to prove it .
i 'm going to have a home .
eve . eve harrington .
i told you a lie .
i just wondered .
just wondered what ?
why .
why what ?
why you have to go out there .
i do n't have to . i want to .
is it the money ?
eighty percent of it will go for taxes .
then why ?
and i shot my mouth off .
it 's only one picture deal .
so few come back ...
yeah .
also addison dewitt .
every day .
you did n't have to tell me .
i have a suggestion .
of course not .
goodbye , mr. sampson .
i 'll admit i was worried when max called .
you should n't have had any doubts .
is that what you want me to be ?
i 'm talking about you .
so am i .
what have i got to do with it ?
everything .
the names i 've been called .
from what would i be running ?
you 're always after truth - on the stage .
i 'm for it .
then face it . i have .
- and for you .
you 're quite a girl .
you think ?
i 'm in love with margo .
you hear all kinds of things .
i 'm only human , rumors to the contrary .
find out .
no thanks , birdie .
i know .
but she just got here ...
she 's on her way .
what did you expect - live sables ?
i never played fort sumter .
buy some .
the same size ?
of course !
well .
oh , brother .
miss coonan ...
you do n't have to apologize for me !
see you home ...
something maybe grew a size bigger .
i have n't got a union .
well ?
but the wardrobe women have got one .
hmm ?
you do n't like eve , do you ?
do you want an argument or an answer ?
an answer .
no .
why not ?
now you want an argument .
she works hard .
night an ' day .
she 's loyal and efficient-
like an agent with one client .
my back 's open .
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- voila .
late for what ?
do n't be dense . the party .
i ai n't dense .
miss harrington ...
what are you doing here ?
i - i guess i fell asleep .
that 's all .
what for ?
you probably wo n't believe me .
probably not .
it was for my report .
what report ? to whom ?
ours was one of the first . erasmus hall .
erasmus hall .
lots of actresses come from brooklyn .
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper .
i 'll just pick up the broken glass .
do n't bother .
how long does it take ?
i do n't care if i never get home .
you rest . i 'll get it ...
why should you be ?
you 're margo channing 's best friend .
he 's the best .
he 'll agree with you .
oh , no . i see the play .
you see the play ?
oh , no ...
she 's got to meet you-
you look just fine ... ... by the way .
eve . eve harrington .
not at all .
my husband ...
try ...
well ...
i think i 'd better .
i 'll be at the old stand , tomorrow matinee-
not just that way . as a friend ...
i 'd like that .
karen .
do n't worry too much about that .
no , dear . margo must go on .
i think she would cheer .
but mr. richards and mr. sampson-
they 'll do as they 're told .
you wo n't forget it ?
i wo n't forget .
no , eve , i wo n't forget ...
they certainly do n't waste much time .
do n't get up .
i do n't intend to be .
ca n't we sit down ?
there ca n't be very much-
oh , but there is-
let 's not get over-dramatic .
i 'm not crying .
tell me .
- an understudy 's performance .
well .
he can help you .
yes , you will .
give yourself time .
something most important you can do .
you want to play `` cora . ''
you talk just as addison said you did .
`` cora '' is my part .
over my dead body ...
that wo n't be necessary .
thank you , karen .
how do you do , mr. richards .
every performance ?
there was an item in the times .
let 's get back to this one .
i hope so , mr. richards . good night ...
not with you in them .
san francisco . it was the last week .
i wo n't be a minute .
they are lovely .
there 's the script to go back to the guild-
i 've got it .
yes , dear . you forgot all about it .
i would n't like .
thank you , eve .
i had no idea you knew each other .
hello , miss channing .
hi .
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny !
yes , it is !
they 're nobody 's fans !
you 've what ?
she 's just outside the door .
the heave-ho .
harrington .
i 'm so sorry ... harrington .
roughly ten minutes .
how far to the station ?
three or four miles ...
it does n't matter .
i detest cheap sentiment .
we 've all seemed a little tense lately ...
so many people - know me .
you 're margo . just - margo .
and what is that ?
what about bill ?
he 's in love with you .
bill 's in love with margo channing .
margo .
those years stretch as the years go on .
not to you . not to bill .
is n't that what they always say ?
well ...
this .
it get better !
with tears .
but not right away ?
very classy stuff , lots of technique-
you 'll be there , wo n't you .
loud .
it 's about time we did !
in a minute ...
up to here !
margo , again ...
and again and again !
that 's on time for margo .
of course she knew !
- do n't run out of adjectives , dear .
margo . margo 's great . she knows it .
what is ?
we 're driving out to the country tomorrow night .
well .
when you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two .
just a little skid , that 's all .
do n't joke about such things .
eve .
eve ?
if we could cast it properly , that is ...
maybe get some younger actress for the part ?
on her knees , i have no doubt !
margo in the cub room .
they 'd die without each other .
you - for one .
margo !
nothing much . she apologized .
not much .
nothing ...
did miss harrington tell you to call mr. richards ?
then tell me this is n't true !
within your time , buster .
and you pose as a playwright .
... among so many quiet qualities .
what is he talking about ?
up in the room .
too many .
shucks .
i will .
the play ? all right , i guess ...
`` cora . ''
twentyish . it is n't important .
do n't be evasive .
margo , you have n't got any age .
miss channing is ageless .
eve ? eve , my understudy ?
you 'd have been proud of her .
i 'm sure .
she was a revelation ...
to you , too ?
what do you mean ?
it 's right to the point .
not mouse , never mouse !
i have no intention of having an accident !
it 's not important whether you do .
i mean really , deeply angry ...
i do n't think i could be .
well .
we are ready with your call to beverly hills ...
call , what call ?
it this templeton 89970 ? miss margo channing ?
that 's right , but i do n't understand-
go ahead , please ...
i just played it .
play it again .
but that was the fourth straight time .
then this will be five .
`` liebestraum . ''
how about me what ?
i ai n't gon na die .
i love you , max .
miss caswell ? what ?
an audition for the part we 're replacing .
a couple of weeks .
i tell you what .

anything to help you out , max .
this is real cooperation . i appreciate it .
not at all .

i promise .
that 's my max .
answer my question !
who am i to threaten ?
i did n't hear you .
i said i 'm a dying man !
-- it was bullshit the way it was --
-- no way --
-- read 'em both and you 'll see --
yeah ?
fuck you , carl .
let me lay a little theory on you --
-- i 'm not interested in theory .
hmm .
-- hunt does n't seem like your ordinary consultant .
maybe a political operative of some sort --
-- a spy , you mean ?
it makes sense ; hunt worked for the c.i.a .
about the past year .
the fucking new york times .
-- see ? --
-- i 'm trying --
-- fifteen phone calls --
it was there .
i never scared anyone before .
facts or theory ?
anything you 've got .
and i 'm a republican .
sure .
who 'd you vote for ?
when ?
'68 .
nixon .
you voted for him .
go on , go on --
-- she was really paranoid , the bookkeeper .
that happens to people . ok , go on .
and i 'll just shitkick in my usual way .
-- colson .
-- shit --
-- we got ta top the times --
-- i know , i know --
-- i know a lawyer at justice --
-- has he got an ax ? --
-- haldeman i know , who else ?
if he self-destructed .
-- 'cause i only know four chords --
we 're inside the white house now .
who ?
haldeman .
it 's nothing personal , though .
what 's the matter ?
maybe we are ...
-- he said john haldeman , not bob haldeman --
hmm ?
what was the mistake ?
goddamnit ! --
-- according to sources involved in the watergate investigation .
-- jeeeeeeesus --
11:30 .
morning or night ?
night .
oh .
the telephone calls ... we know about that .
the rest is barker 's bank records .
this ? naw ...
-- howard hunt ?
sure .
sure .
i 'm so glad .
i 'd really like to see mr. dardis .
and you will . but not now .
i called him from washington .
he is not in the car . sorry .
well of course .
good .
that 's right .
mind if i try ?
when did he hire you ?
i did n't do anything wrong .
tell that to muskie .
oh , maybe nickel and dime stuff .
but you know who did .
sure -- off the record .
on the orders of haldeman ?
-- yes --
we 've just been talking to young --
-- deep throat ? --
absolutely --
-- what about you ? --
oh , they 're here .
carl , it 's a jungle .
lot of pressure at the star .
five hundred ; six maybe .
give me your checkbook then .
it 's right under that pile .
there 's always a later plane .
you do n't believe me ?
just let me get a match .
i 'm relaxed -- light your cigarette .
the ones who could disburse the money .
who were they ?
what do you want to know ?
no games , irwin ; give .
something maybe big .
a miami d.a .
irwin ?
to cover up ?
i will not talk about the other two .
kalmbach -- nixon 's personal lawyer .
we 're moving .
-- this 'll only take one second --
i 'm not your source on that .
my non-denial denial .
you asking me to disclose my source ?
i do n't know titles .
-- his dialing finger must be falling off --
-- what do you think ? --
electronic surveillance .
ok .
look , i told you inside --
you 're a lawyer and you 're here --
i have nothing more to say .
absolutely -- marilyn 's gotten it totally wrong --
the twenty-five thousand dollar one .
... you 're definitely doing a story ... ?
yes , sir .
i do n't know ; i really do n't .
to where ?
go on .
ratfucking .

larry young , a california lawyer --
my wife told me to expect you .

not the jaguar . the _other_ car .
the _rolls_ ?
_no_ , sir . _the_ _other_ _car_ !
i shall be near at hand .
which `they ' might that be , sir ?
jack napier 's dead . my parents are avenged .
why , indeed ?
could i let batman go ? for dick .
dr. meridian ...
how ? as batman , knowing she wants me ?
not that young .
as well as can be expected , i guess .
dick has run away .
perhaps the fall ...
there 's one other thing . i feel..
what ?
... afraid .
bruce . son . listen to me .
what ?
i remember a bat . a monster .
no demons , son . your monsters are here .
... batman , alfred . i 'm batman .
what do maniacs always want ?
recognition , of course .
precisely .
of course . 13 is m ... .mre .
how about , mr. e .
mystery .
and another name for mystery ?
enigma .
exactly . mr. e. mister edward nygma .
claw island . nygma 's headquarters .
tonight 's a good night .
how ya doin ' , al ?
al ?
big house . how many rooms ?
master wayne 's dead wives .
just checking , young sir .
four seconds from ...
and you are ?
i 'm flattered .
why 's that ?
i did n't know that . see ?
what 's wrong ?
last night at the circus .
it 's the car , right ?
what is it about the wrong kind of man ?
try a fireman . less to take off .
i do n't mind the work .
my life 's an open book . you read ?
you like strong women .
maybe you just have n't met the right woman ...
did two-face call him bruce ?
no more tricks , edward .
excellent . see .
for _me_ ? really ? tell me .
i see without seeing .
oh please . you 're blind as a bat .
exactly !
bruce wayne . in the flesh .
nygma . edward nygma . you hired me .
precisely . what 's on all our minds ?
wait . you ca n't go .
we 'll talk some other -
no . do n't leave me ! my invention !
what ? oh , edward . hi . congratulations .
gracious even in defeat . how vaguely disappointing .
nostrovia .
la'chiem .
slanta .
rinka .
banzai .
somebody 's been sending me love letters .
just ones this beautiful .
the infamous wayne charm .
on occasion . usually at night .
she 's a malaysian dream warden .
me ? no .
wacko ? that a technical term ?
what do you know about obsession ?
not much .
the letter writer is obsessed with you .
to kill me .
you understand obsession better than you let on .
no insights here , doc .
that 's usually my line .
look , i 'd love to keep chatting-
would you ? i 'm not so sure .
and into a black dress .
i 'm sorry . who are you ?
what ? this is n't normal ?
i do n't get you bruce wayne .
me ? i 'm easy .
well , i met someone ...
fast work . you just moved here .
he sure did .
what ?
i said i 'm sure he did .
sorry .
and now ... .
they 've changed . the dreams , i mean .
what ?
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask .
i 'm not-
rage . anger . passion . pain .
touchy , touchy .
so how goes your `scholarly ' pursuit of batman ?
oh god , bruce . you 're still jealous .
spare me the diagnosis , okay ?
excuse me , boys .
okay , tiger , take it slow .
i do n't want to remember !
stop fighting .
what does it say ?
i don't- .
you do know . try .
oh god , bruce , you were a child .
... not the bat ?
what ?
chase .
excuse me .
listen , dick .
look , spare me the sermons , okay .
absolutely not .
what i do is n't about revenge .
you do n't understand . it 's an addiction .
you have a real gratitude problem .
how about richard grayson , college student ?
... i missed two-face by a heartbeat .
i saved your life . you owe me .
dick , let go .
but what about all the good we can do ?
and when you finally get two-face ?
bruce , you ca n't .
chase is coming for dinner .
of course you are .
who is it ?
it 's dr. meridian . chase .
how could i forget ?
dr. burton tells me you know who batman is .
yesssssss . i know !
ca n't tell if you do n't say please .
you 're right , edward .
let me ask you something , bruce .
paranoid ? the psychotic ?
... the box can change their lives .
fred ?

i do n't think so .
... you gon na kill me ?
might . might not .
what say we flip for it ?
please . i swear i wo n't say noth-
the coin _wants_ to decide .
uh , yeah . thanks , mr..uh ... face .

never heard of a double-cross ?
a man with a death wish .
harvey . you need me .

addictive is n't it ? just say no .

what about nomak ?
he escaped .
minutes .
from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank .
which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago .
right . so why is he dying ?
if that 's true , what about nomak ?
nomak 's different . he 's the carrier .
exactly . look at the digestive system .
you do n't have to hunt to do it .
really ?
fry 'em .
save it .
what ?
`` each day is a little life .
i do n't think so .
for what ?
why ?
get real .
i am a hunter . a weapon .
well it 's in mine , too .
i do n't understand .
not good .
i want to see the sun rise .
did you think i would n't ?
took you long enough .
you put a bullet in my brain .
sounds like a plan .
what do you really think ?
i do n't like it .
i 'll show you .
we 'll split into three units .
where the hell have you been ?
just out connecting a few dots .
why do n't you ask your girlfriend ?
blood ...
you do n't have a choice .
so ?
thought you were dead .
for what ?
not alone .
revenge . that 's what nomak wanted all along .
ultra-rapid detox .
human ?
keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
he was here . watching us .
nomak ?
you 're wasting your time , blade .
two things .
getting your attention , paco .
well you 've got it , warmblood .
thiavolos , as we used to say in greece .
nomak said something to blade in greek .
from his father , of course .
you experimented on your own , son ?
are you insane ? he 'll kill us both !
maybe it 's better that way .
they 've made contact with the reapers .
any casualties ?
two so far .
no .
nobody to call in case of an emergency ?
scud .
whatever -- what 'd you do to the charger ?
the pimp-mobile ?
fuck yeah .
look , what 's your problem ?
our operation ? ! our operation ? !
so how long have you known blade , anyway ?
going on twenty years now .
blade does n't talk about the old days much .
blade does n't talk about anything much .
i was backpacking .
after last night ?
you little shit .
are we bringing home strays now ?
you should 've killed her , then .
she has n't turned yet .
just do it , old man .
maybe not .
it 's not worth the risk .
wait .
do n't even start , old man .
china town . i need more serum .
listen . you have to -- finish me off .
no , we can treat the wounds --
i know .
how can you be out here ?
i dabble in pharmaceuticals , medical research .
why not ?
maybe i do n't see it that way .
you 're wrong .
am i ?
pass .
you sure now ?
watch me .
frost ! ! !
take him .
you 're blind --
there are other ways to see . sit .
show me .
who is lamagra ?
the vampire god . this speaks of his return .
yes . the vampire apocalypse .
but i just got here --
you 've been here longer than you think .
i 'm sorry , i --
you 're joking --
because you 're tainted .
what happens then ?
i do n't care what you believe .
not anymore . you 've seen one of them .
do it .
figured they 'd send someone after you .
it worked , did n't it ?
but , he could 've --
he did n't . get over it .
he 's a familiar .
for some . live forever , never get old .
preventive medicine .
you do n't know that .
what do you see here ?
graffiti --
look closer .
how can you tell ?
the way they move , they way they smell --
like what ?
like me .
some kind of archive --
is n't this all a little high-tech ?
you 've been watching too much tv .
nothing that wo n't heal by dawn .
serum -- it 's a human hemoglobin substitute .
you get used to the darkness .
i do . i remember from day one .
blade --
cancer .
some . it 's been slow --
you do n't look so good .
i 'm just tired , that 's all .
you make it sound like i 'm already dead .
i 've been better --
how long have we been driving ?
i do n't know .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm not leaving without you .
you do n't understand . the thirst --
i know . take some of my blood .
no --
it 's the only way . you know that .
you 're a week early .
i was in the neighborhood .
maybe it 's time to start exploring other alternatives .
there 's only one alternative to the serum .
deacon brought me back .
fight him --
listen to your father , jason .
these are my people now .
you do n't have to be .
you do n't understand .
i do n't believe that .
you will . time is on our side .
then what is it ?
i thought you promised to give me some distance ?
just the blood sample from the pericardial sac .
what ?
you 're wrong , dragonetti .
he is an abomination !
someone who 's sick of living off scraps .
you 're wasting your time , frost .
perhaps .
a few thousand scattered about the globe .
what happens then ?
the blood tide .
lamagra --
that 's right .
who better to usher in the blood tide ?
what makes you think we want to be cured ?
only as a last resort .
why ?
you 're wasting your breath , woman .
get away from him !
you 've been bitten by a vampire .
my name is abraham whistler . this is blade .
so that 's it ?
you 've been listening in the whole time ?
go on , i 'll be fine !
what happens if he does n't take the serum ?
the thirst overcomes him , just like the others .
which is why you 're here .
habit , mostly , just like this .
eventually . he toyed with them first .
i did n't .
with a retrovirus .
-- which she may have --
hey , folklore --
join the club .
a coward too .
what happened to her , where did she go ?
do n't know -- just that she was afraid --
-- anna --
my eye , is there something in my eye ?
closer .
closer .
-- my god , nick ? ? ?
bullshit ! talk !
nick ! !
yes .
what 're you doing there ?
trying to find the energy .
inside the grave ?
to stand up -- i 'm exhausted .
sometimes . where are we going ?
look , this is not my field of expertise .
mrs. leavitt --
-- i 'm not staying here !
let 's talk to your husband --
-- he 's not my husband !
the witch 's voice .

no -- never .
your witness .
you may call your next witness .

no . i have n't done it in years .
no .
a little after eleven .

thank you .
six years .

it must have been horrible .
you 've tried it ?
you do n't like miss lawson much do you ?
no .

-- and that he changed his will ?
yes .
she talked him into it . she wanted everything .
yes .
well - i 'm a little confused .
yes .
dristan nasal spray .
a.m -- or p.m. ?

you killed him -- did n't you , joanne ?
what do you think i 've got ?
why 'd you come here ?
to show you this .
no .
frank -- what are you doing here ?
i need to ask you a question .
you know i ca n't talk about that .
i 'm not asking for names or specifics .
and she left shortly after that ?
no further questions .
there are no charges against you .
i do n't know .
you must have some feeling . some immediate impression .
not a very good one i 'm afraid .
i 'll have you out in a few hours .
i am who i am .
no pain , no gain ?
something like that .
we 're not animals .
as it pertains to you -- not me .
yes .
how ?
because -- it 's beyond intellect .
i was at a cocktail party . very trendy .
we started talking .
why did n't you live together ?
sure . where to ?
i know .
because , i 'm your attorney .
is it against the law ?
no -- it just does n't look right .
i think the photographer 's probably a voyeur .
i 'm the photographer .
oh -- well , they 're different .
that 's not an answer .
it 's not my taste .
tastes can change .
not true .

what ?
i just left joanne braslow .
that 's not good enough , goddamit !
it is n't true .
no , i do n't have to believe you .
i went out on the boat .
of course .
it 's only the beginning .
you can see me now .
paley could be a problem tomorrow .
do n't worry about paley .
what does that mean ?
honey .
tonight we open new doors .

you 're too weak , frank .
i knew you were thinking that .
you do n't need anybody .
i do need you .
no -- you 're not .
no -- i 'm a survivor .
frank -- it 's rebecca .

how 's it supposed to work rebecca ?
i 'm supposed to be on vacation .
she 's waiting in the conference room .

he could let you have your vacation .
some example you set .
attractive . bright . distant .
yeah -- but can she cook ?

i was n't always like that .
i 'm about ten blocks from the school .
i have no right to ask for help .
that makes two of us .
you 're breaking up .
i 've lost you . you 're gone .
i 'm making my turn .
i can hear you again , clearly .
great . stay with me .

i 'm cutting across to bundy to brentwood .
jack will negotiate with them .
do n't say that .
do you know what 's in that box ?
i 'm not supposed to -- but i do .
i 'm pretty good at signatures myself .
oh my god . i heard her scream again .
you 're doing what you can .
to hide it from the i.r.s .
how come everybody turns out to be a crook ?
do n't talk . do n't talk !
what 's going on ?
the front door slammed . someone went out .
i might still get there first .
it wo n't be him .
jack has n't loved me for years .
why tell me this ?
no .
did you hear that click ?
yes -- i think so . another crossed line ?
or somebody else there is listening in --
downstairs . there must be an extension .
do n't panic . i might be wrong .
try what you did before . it worked before .
hi lenore . it 's me .
they dragged me downstairs .
lucky for them they did n't .
what did you do ?
god , if he does n't come back --
are you okay ?
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles .
that 's coming off . how about the girl ?
she 's awake but she has n't spoken .
your husband ?
he 's in back . lying face down .
you 're all three of you in that van ?
yes .
yes sir .
put the man back on .
she 's next .
do n't start thinking about it .
yes .
can you walk ?
yes .
they wo n't allow that .
why ca n't it be her ?
she 's a child . she might panic .
all right .
just start walking . come on .
shit . i 'm sorry .
she 'll be with you soon .
include me in that .
why did n't you just shoot them ?
because a lot of people would 've gotten killed .
they tortured us .
they put their hands all over me .
hand me the phone .
why are you telling him that .
there is n't any such person .
whose money is this ?
it belongs to the man you took it from .
jack oberfeld in person . did you kill him ?
damned if i know .
they always pick rachel up early on thursday .
i got what i fucking deserved .
as they say -- no good deed goes unpunished .
nobody 's easier to con than a con man .
you knew about me .
l.a.p.d .
shit .
there 's no way out for you .
assure them that you 're being well treated .
absolutely .
i 'm not trying to lose them .
a typical fuck-up .
what 's that supposed to me ?
naturally you did n't learn your lesson .
only in the leg or the thigh .
yes i would . not kill you .
then scream for me . a repeat performance .
he wants 75 back .
plus names , addresses and i.d .
let me talk to him .
what 's nels ' number ?
259-7881 .

i need a break .
sooner or later you 'll learn to trust me .
how about `` later ? ''
we ca n't leave him to repeat anything .
naturally .
naturally .
maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us .
only one way to find out .
that 's how it 's going to be .
nothing but cds in there .
took preparation .
exactly who was this oberfeld ?

be careful , peter .
you took the words right out of my mouth .
a quarter of a million dollars .
that 's all .
but he did n't !
peter , you 've got to promise me something .
the man you had the fight with .

words can hurt very much .
hey -- i 'm on your side .

how can you tell ?
he 's allergic to him .
the american embassy .
i do n't know .

a complete surprise ?
yes .
but i thought you 'd hired a private investigator .
a private investigator ?
mr. gittes .
well yes .

i said i 'll drop it .
mrs. mulwray ?
yes , mr. gittes ?
i do n't want to drop it .
why ? ... what on earth for ?
what do you mean ?
may i speak frankly , mrs. mulwray ?
you may if you can , mr. gittes .
suppose they did . how does it concern you ?
nothing personal , mrs. mulwray , i just --
it 's very personal .
look at it this way .
looks like you went quite a distance .
no , just riding bareback , that 's all .
i 'll stop by .
please call first .
... just a minute ...
you left your keys in the ignition .
oh ... thank you .

i think so .
it was n't much of a lie .
if your husband was killed it was .
my husband .

why ?
she 's cheating on him .
did you have affairs ?
mr. gittes .
did he know ?
where you were when your husband died .

i mean i ca n't tell you .
you were seeing someone , too .
that your maiden name ?

i spent two years here .
what about you ?

i ca n't promise you anything .
you think it 's a conspiracy ?
now she tells me .
yes you do , jerry . quite well .
that 's great . good for you .
who have you been talking to , jerry ?
could you be a little more specific ?
you should n't watch , jerry .
you 've never seen her run .
then i ca n't be hurt anymore .
you 're welcome . where 's my partner ?
i like that .
i 'm not sure what you mean .
i 'm not a violent man , mr. lowry .
well , i do n't know if --
i 'm leaning toward no .
that 's your option .
we got someone watching her 24 hours a day .
that 's not what i mean .
i do n't know ...
then screw you . i 'll rot .
alright . you can see her .
whatever .
a dog bit it .

oh ? how 's he doing ?
no doubt .
ellie ...
you know why i 'm here .
goddamnit , they are out there , david --
then why have n't you detected any signals ?

apparently he 's genuinely interested in science .
i 'm going to convert mr. science-is- the-root-of-all-evil ?
we 've cracked it . lunacharsky found it .
you mean --
you were right , ellie .
ellie .
do you have a minute -- ?

it 'll just take a moment .
i 'm asking for your help , david .

mmm , that 's a good one .
okay , okay ... there .
that 's a beauty , captain .
that 's my scientist .
so . are you an hallucination ?
but you 're so ...
originally just another species like yourselves .
small moves , captain , small moves .
why did you contact us ?
you contacted us . we were simply listening .
and those other docking ports i saw ...
many others .
we do n't know .
so we passed some kind of test ?
you have your mother 's hands ...
can you help us ?
the librarian ... or the library ... ?
so . what happens now ?
now ... you go home .
no ! i mean ... why so soon ?
no . please .
childhood is over , ellie .
the infamous , unfashionable bluntness .
what kind of deal ?
i did n't realize i was out .
you 've ... found it .
not if you think like a vegan .
very good , doctor .
and in return ?
it 's so ... small .

i 'd say logic more than faith .
what about you ?
very smooth . it 's palmer , right ?
only a tiny bit .
i had ... an experience . of belonging .
do you love your parents ?
i never knew my mother .
did you love him ?
yes . very much .

some of my best friends are scientists .
not exactly .
i do n't think so .
why ?
it 's too ... elegant .
you 're willing to die for this .
really .
what 'd you think ?
i thought it was well-written . heart-felt .
i do n't consider you the enemy , ellie .
i do n't know .
it 's getting late ...
what are you so afraid of , ellie ?
it 's late . we should go back .

pretty ironic , huh ?
they do n't believe me .
i do .
you 're sure you want to ?
i do n't have any proof , palmer .
ellie , you 're the proof .
have you seen what 's happening out there ?
in other words .
does that mean you think it does n't exist ?

no . but when he 's in that car ...
have you seen his penis ?

the junior pathologist at ashford hospital .
yes . i did n't plan it that way .
yes . they felt like traffic accidents .
no .
i saw the blood .
are you still involving me in your crash ?
i can drive .
a complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition .
i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes .

you 're not jealous , are you ?
hard to say .
i 'm going to leave now .
no , thanks . i 'll go with vaughan .
yes .
it 's not the police .
i live in my car .

it 's hospital policy ...
well , i do n't have hallucinations . honest .
psychologist , therapist , whatever .

i have a going-away gesture for you , too .
oh ?
me ? nothing .
there 's nothing to tell .

you 're slowing .
ecru .

i did n't say ...
that 's thanks to all your help .
i ruined your wedding night .

do you want to go see him ?
i ca n't .
i know . i know .
come on .
wow . congratulations .
you 've only known jake a few months .
no , not yet . but you know paul .
paul could pop the question at any time .
mom , please .
especially with a promotion in the offing .
can i get you a glass of champagne ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry .
oh , letty , what happened ?
but what about beast ? who 'll ... ?
ruth 's already taken him home .

i understand you just got engaged .
i 'm glad .
letty .
it 's ok .
terrific .
what about patterns ?
what if it 's got a pattern ?
is this really important ?
that must be really difficult .
you took bets on my diagnosis ?
it 's no big deal . we all compare .
who do you think you are ?
anything interesting .
i 've already checked it out 17 times .
paul .
very romantic setting .
it was romantic . he 's very romantic .
so are you engaged , or what ?
it 's magic .
enough with the abracadabra .

i wish i could have seen that .
break up ? they wish .
i just want to see beast .
the mission up in santa barbara .
no way .

your family just met me .
you 're right . i guess i was projecting .
i do .
michael , i ...
oh , right . i 'm ready .

home free .
i was brilliant , or at least boringly sane .
so there were no problems ?
not a one .
and did you go to the mission ?
i saw paul leaving .
yeah .
so , it 's over ?

so that 's what this is all about .
keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
sounds intriguing .
she 's quite cute you know .
oh come on , kathryn .
oh yes .
b.f.d . what do you plan to do ?
you do n't stand a chance .
care to make a wager on that ?
i 'll think about it ...
oh well , duty calls .
could you be more desperate to read it ?
in english . i 'll fuck your brains out .
even there ?
it would feel so yummy .
i 'm working on it .
loser .
blow me .
call me later .
okay .
shhh .
you ready for this ?
no .
call cecile up and get her to come over .
i rat cecile out to mommy .
but who will they turn to for help ?
thank you . mmmm , that feels good .
oh sis . you 're so tense .
i hate it too .
have you succeeded in your task ?
any day now .
well , let me know when you do .
cecile .
what is that ?
eat me , sebastian .
who are you spying on ?
take a look for yourself .
yeah .
jesus , she reeks of laura ashley .
what 's your problem ?
nothing .
and that 's why you 're losing your bet ?
i 'm not losing the bet .
morning .
so ? how 'd it go last night ?
with who ?
well i know how it went with cecile .
exactly the opposite .
so what went wrong ?
i do n't know .
you do n't know ?
where 'd she go ?
she would n't say .
kind of .
oh yes .
tell me all the details .
it was ... fantastic .
oh come on . for her first time ?
i know .
no , tell me .
mock , mock , mock .

i 'm not in the mood .
and that 's why you 're leaving ?
it clearly is why .
i want to fuck .
and i do n't .
no , i 'm not .
p-whipped , p-whipped .
what 's wrong with you ?
not anymore you do n't . it 's obvious .
i ca n't believe you 're reacting this way .
i 've never done this before .
how have you dumped girls in the past ?
screening calls . any suggestions ?
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons .
i have a flair for drama .
annette ?
well done .
thank you . now , where were we ?
come again ?
will you calm down ?
fine ! get off me !
i accept . now get out .
get out ? we had an arrangement .
did n't you hear what i said ?
then i will consider it a declaration of war .
i think you have your answer .
war it is .
how do you do it ?
that 's beautiful .
not at all . what 's wrong ?
it 's cecile .
what about her ?
kathryn , you have my word .
it 's worse .
i know .
black .
you will be discreet about this ?
absolutely .
oh please .
it 's the least i can do .
excuse me .
i 'm paying you to give cello lessons .
mrs. caldwell i think you 're misunderstanding something .
is that so ?
whatever .
i guess that puts me in my place .
you must be sebastian .
i 'll do that .
i need to talk to annette .
she 's not here .
do you know where she is ?
she 's out .
do you know when she 'll be back ?
later .
annette ! annette !
it 's really important .
i understand . good night .
i did ?
we played backgammon ?
uh huh . you beat me three times .
i did ?
yep . then i fucked your daughter .
excuse me ?
oh ... no thank you ...
eight o'clock . you got to go .
did she show up ?
nope .
do you mind if i check upstairs ?
do n't worry about it .
you 're a lucky guy .
she really loves me .
how will i get to her ?
what are you talking about ?
kathryn . did you hit her ?
kathryn ?
did you hit her ?
you bastard !
i 'd love to .
hello .
no . i only let her go with edward .
it 's one of the clearest memories i have .
you know what i wished , daddy ?
i was n't saying anything . i was singing .
the song i was trying to hum .
oh , you 'll remember it some time .
yes , darling .
did you ever make a wish ?
oh , lots of times .
did your wishes ever come true ?
sometimes .
that 's what i wished on .
at the old house with the voice .
on the back street  a green house
the farren house
do you know the people ?
no dear .
i got my wish anyway .
sh ! then you must keep it true .
i had my breakfast while you were still asleep .
it was right there on top .
she was very pretty .
what 's her name ?
irena .
irena .
look !
all right , mommy .
you ca n't open it yet .
all right , amy .
i know that .
it 's early yet .
it 's nearly a quarter after four .
yes , darling ,
all right , ollie . go ahead .
that 's right .
what do you mean ?
i called not only the boyds but the irvings .
but they must have .
amy 's been lying again .
well , it seemed to me --
you mean you did n't .
i 'm never unfair .
you 're shouting at me .
i thought amy was calling . i guess not .
what ?
it 's your play .
i 'm sorry . i was somewhere else .
well , you know where it is .
amy picked it off the top of that stack .
that darn kid .
we 've got to go on .
but i told her to go with you .
mommy 's having a party for me .
are you coming to see us . miss callahan ?
no , darling , i had n't intended to .
i live right here .
maybe i 'll drop in and see your mommy .
and you should .
did you mail then ?
yes , i did .
where did you mail them ?
i 'll show you .
yes , daddy .
certain wishes do .
but i did n't play with them , daddy .
because you did n't ask them ?
they ran away .
why did n't you run after them ?
i did .
it 's true .
and who did the voice belong to ?
it was just a voice .
let me be the judge of that .
voices from an old dark house !
and this one 's for mrs. farren .
this one has n't got a name on it .
yes , amy ?
why , daddy , you know my friend too !
because she is my friend .
in the garden ? would she be there now ?
she 's there whenever i call her !
but irena is in the garden .
listen , darling .
she 's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there .
yes , darling .
tell me tha real truth .
i do n't know yet .
we open ours on christmas eve .
you called me by my name .
irena . but who are you ?
i 'm your friend .
i 've wanted a friend .
i 've wanted a friend too .
but where do you come from ?
you would n't understand .
but where is that ?
i can not tell you .
will you be friend for always ?
for as long as you 'll let me .
i shall want you for always .
for always , then .
not even daddy ... or mommy ?
no .
whenever you want .
i 'll just never learn arithmetic .
but you must !
the numbers simply do n't mean anything
oh yes they do . look .
a princess ?
of course .
that 's right !
this is more fun than just pretend .
of course ,
that one 's an elm .
pretend , darling .
your children ?
my dolls . we can pretend .
yes , winter 's coming .
oh , but the winter 's fun .
oh , thank you , amy .
you can open it now , i guess .
i shall wear it in my hair !
you and i shall enjoy christmas together .
oh , please !
a merry christmas to you , amy .
you wanted to share this moment with me .
it stands so still .
it is wildness and freedom .
i want to touch it .
do n't cry , amy .
she 's dead !
but she 's dead !
amy , listen to me .
oh , it is , it is !
but , amy ! amy ... i 'm dead .
yes , amy .
but why ?
death 's like life .
that 's a fine-looking ring .
a lady threw it to me .
i 'm trying to .
let me take another look at that ring .
you just wait until i finish here .
soon as i finish .
but she 's such a nice lady .
but i do n't want you coming here alone .
but i saw what it was .
but what happened to the little deer ?
probably hit by a car .
why is it just lying there ?
because it ca n't . it 's dead .
but where has it gone ?
the ring ?
no , thank you .
one little piece of cake wo n't hurt you .
mommy read it to ne .
why has n't he got a head ?
good .
a christmas present .
do n't you hear it ?
do n't you read shakespeare ?
yes , yes -
i ca n't do it !
look at me .
my barbara was killed . i killed her .
anybody could know that song .
gray . they were a lovely , lovely gray .
and my eyes ... my eyes are gray .
yes ... yes , that 's true .
yes , barbara ... barbara ...
yes .
i-sha n't see her .
i 'll not see her , barbara .
good night ... barbara ...
now , i do n't know amy --
she pleaded so to do it
so do i , mr. reed .
good heavens ! what could you be giving me .
amy has too many fancies -- too few friends .
perhaps she 's wanted for understanding .
what 's with her ?
i do n't believe in pms .
can we get some service here ?
jennifer gave her a make-over .
looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over .
do n't apologize .
i 've changed a lot lately .
yeah yeah i know . smoking kills .
james dean , humphrey bogart ...
yul brynner . they 're all dead .
yeah but they looked cool ...
your lips look delicious .
i 've been working out .
i mean body temperature .
never felt better .
at victoria 's secret .
i mean where on your body ?
oh , on my wrist .
no , it was another woman .
good . except for pms .
it 's hard to describe .
nearly four .
how have you been feeling ?
i get crazy dreams and i black out .
diet and exercise , that 's all there is .
now it 's menopause . she 's always hot .
no it 's mom .
mom !
what does that have to do with me ?
translation : a total geek .
anything 's better than mark .
my shrink says he 's not so bad .
your shrink always gives you bad advice .
so do n't look in his eyes .
people notice you frida .
maybe he 's just shy .
i get a little bloated sometimes .
i 'd kill for just a little bloated .
only to see .
ca n't you get contacts ?
or if your boyfriend 's an asshole .
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for ?
i do n't know .
there 's a sale .
frida , grab that red one .
and she got the medium .
even on sale that stuff 's a fortune .
what a bitch . you should see a doctor .
i kind of asked him to .
are you kidding ?
they better .
where ?
i do n't see anything .
holy shit , i 'm a freak .
oh , my glasses !
there you go , blaming yourself for everything again .
and he was ripped limb from limb ?
i 'm sure they were exaggerating .
why would they exaggerate ?
to sound like big macho cops .
did i kill him ? of course not !
no , did you fuck him ?
no . i do n't think so .
you do n't think so ?
i do n't remember .
did you get smashed or what ?
he was trying to get into my apartment and ...
and then ?
i think i went in and fell asleep .
at least your pms is over .
and my bra finally fits again .
no , mark wears boxers .
i wonder if he 's married .
he was n't wearing a ring .
hmmm . sounds suspicious .
i do n't know much about him .
give him the tampon test .
what the hell is the tampon test ?
you have to stop being so self- critical frida .
i looked like an italian man !
great . george is meeting carlton first for drinks .
i think he called you beautiful .
oh my god .
it is so hot in here .
i ca n't help it .
no they 're not .
it 's just cause mine is finer .
i look like fuckin ' chewbacca .
no !
frida , you 're not making sense .
i put it down the garbage disposal .
and what makes you think you killed a man ?
maybe the blood was from your period like before .
i have n't gotten it yet .
frida , listen to yourself .
frida ? i was worried to death about you .
i 've been here . what day is it ?
tuesday . are you okay ?
shit , i guess i missed work .
frida , carlton 's dead .
oh no .
and he was missing an arm .
oh my god jennifer .

i do n't know ...
he 's been here all night ?
yeah , i guess . mark ?
i should call the police . oh no peter .
do n't call the police .
why not ? there 's been a murder .
first of all , you 're my alibi .
what ? why 'd you do that ?
there 's kind of this guy i 'm seeing .
you 're cheating on george ?
i could smell another woman on him .
that 's a terrible thing to say .
no .
ignore it .
hide him .
does that mean this whole thing is over ?
probably for three weeks or so anyway .
you 're such a good friend .
so are you .
maybe you should go out with him .
who is this madame sconce ?
she died at age 34 in the 1800 's .
guess she never found true love .
what choice do we have ?
so what do i do ?
fall in love .
i think i already have .
you scared the shit out of me .
i tried to kill myself -- earlier .
i 'm just afraid i 'll hurt peter .
remember what madame sconce said .
i guess you 'll find out .
no . i ca n't take that chance .
no . i wo n't let you do that .
the werewolf always dies at the end .

no way can anything be proved .
i 'm so sorry ... i ...

what makes you think i was the last one ?
you got a dog ?
no , i have a cat .
how big ?
packages of money .
she 's just so ... pathetic .
she 's just insecure .
carlton insisted on leaving with her .
so now being with frida is lucky ?
tell her i 'm eating .
you have some weird friends .
take some allergy medicine .
you ca n't believe this bullshit .
she 's my best friend .
yeah , sorry .
we 're just trying to figure out what happened .
we can just take this pillowcase .
he 's been running money for the mafia .
you 're some catch lloyd .
torn apart . limb from limb .
that dude was torn limb from limb .
oh , so you decide to be a cop ?
i told you she was innocent .
hey , there was a lot of blood .
she was never a suspect lloyd .
i checked all the zoos . no missing animals .
madonna 's in penthouse ?

she 's not a suspect .
you take the cake lloyd .
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck .

quite a good one . a monet .
i 'm not here to run errands .

as i recall , you 've robbed it before .
years ago , if memory serves .

they 're having a farewell party the last night .
that 's when we 'll do it .
we go underwater ?
we 're doing this together . we 're partners .
precisely .
look , i can help .
no , dammit ! i mean me !
that 's because i wanted them to !
you need a partner for this job .
it was perfect .
you 're too easily impressed with yourself .
we get the mask i 'll tell you .
let 's just see how we do .
we are ... for the tools .
try laps . say a hundred .
our equipment has arrived .
hmmm .
yes you did .
the lipstick thermal camera ?
charged ?
charged . receiver ?
one more item -- not on the check list .
it 's -- -beautiful .
do n't get any ideas .
thank you .
it 's not a village .
i 've got something for you .
little celebration before we set off .
to our ... partnership .
terrified . still am .
my father told me not to be afraid .
so you had to be your own lifeline .
something like that .
bookshelf . sensors --
popup , on floorboards . and --
in eye of that painting .
it 's a party .
let 's mingle a little , shall we ?
you 're not on the beat .
these rooms are solid stone .
you ca n't be too careful .
yes , you can .
ready .
got it .
behind you .
duh .
shut up .
the mask .
yes . yes .
what do i need a thief for ?
it 's your mistake .
the big job .
there is no big job .
a billion dollars .
get the hell in .
you do n't know the half of it .
speaking of money . you said billions .
i always knew you 'd do the job .
everything .
there 's food in the fridge .
would you quiet down ! just for a minute ?
i 'd taken the mask ?
my job , my rules .
you 're being useless .
the eight billion . from them to us .
right . the eight billion .
guest lists of every a-list party on turnover night .
where the money is .
and the money goes --
it 's no good without the argon gas .
you 've thought of everything .
we 're doing it tonight .
that 's the beauty of it .
you 're out of your mind .
there 's always a surprise .
i 've covered everything .
you 're overestimating yourself again .
like a woman of mystery .
charged .
parachute .
packed .
surgically attached .
no . you 'll see when we get inside .
ca n't break tradition . it 's bad luck .
there is one more thing .
call it a new tradition .
it was wrong to deceive you .
but that 's all behind us now .
have really held you under ?
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention .
i 'm sorry .
four billion dollars .
seen one billion , seen them all .
that 's because you grew up rich .
a flaw in your research , my dear .
what ? another job ? stealing the eiffel tower ?
they drive so recklessly there .
brought us luck once , maybe it will again .
hong kong midnight , happy new year .
fucking thing ! ! !
the disc is still in there .
i sincerely hope not .
you can do it .
no way .
go !
get out of here !
no , you ca n't .
i 'm not leaving without you .
nothing is wrong .
it 's only ninety seconds up the line .
both sides of the street , i 'm afraid .
that would be thibadeaux .
you gave them the eight billion .
you mean the seven billion .
always in a rush .
tomorrow . it has to be tomorrow .
in the van .
tina was a wonderful woman .
do n't go getting sentimental .
the key to success is using the right tools .
sure would n't want you to be uncomfortable .
this is big enough .
it 's never big enough .
because i never assume anything .
it better be worth it for me .
i can not tell you a goddamned lie .
it 's too soon .
the early bird gets the damn worm .
but the second mouse gets the cheese .
remind me why .
because it pays off .
we 're supposed to .
you better not be taking on a new partner .
suspicious , after all these years ?
you change partners , you change the rules .
you damn well thought wrong .
i 'm terribly sorry old man .
check out my ball .
it 's not just art , it 's history .
i 'm waiting for the tell part .
she 's calling the shots now .
you 're impressed with her , are n't you ?
she 's good . give her that .
she reminds you of yourself .
it 's never happened before .
you better be keeping your mind on business .
to yourself , that 's where .
she wo n't tell me everything .
you 're giving them to me ?
call it an expression of trust .
thought you had to use some of these .
the face decays , the mask does n't .
probably not .
yeah . probably not .
oh , hell . i 'm dyslexic .
that 's a joke , right ?

ben . this is business . just work .
ben , the money 's not important .

i had it at four .
this makes five .

victor 's better at these things .
< u > should < /u > ?
ben . this is serious .
three days . i was worried about you .

the suit will stretch . you should try it --
i would n't be caught dead in that .
oh , he did .
it 's not him .
just give reed a little more time .
no , it 's not .
victor must 've taken him .
and they 're changing into ...
i do n't really know .
like the shields reed said would protect us .
i wish i could tell you .
the center for disease control .
that 's terrible news ...
what about you ?
ben ! ben !
cool . what 'd it do to you guys ?
ben , are you there ?
you 've been working out .
oh , it is .
... and figure out how to reverse them .
i can go hotter !

ben 's still out there --
so reel him in .
reed , we 're running out of time .
ben did this .
< u > ben < /u > did this ?
< u > i < /u > ruined ?
it 's been changed .
great minds think alike .
yes , thanks .
that 's good . that 's uh ... good .
you always had a way with words .
passion .
what ? what do you mean you --
we need to get past them .
what ... ?
if it happened to him , then it could ...
what about you ?
anger . rage . frustration .
okay .
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
i just wanted to share an apartment .
no . there were n't .
the plants , from space .
curing countless diseases , not just ours .
of course . of course .
and you sure you can control this thing ?
no way to know .
you < u > were < /u > ?
of course i was .
why did n't you say something ?
that would have kinda defeated the purpose .
reed , stop , you need to rest your --
a < u > gasket < /u > ?
right , of course , the company ...
raising the shields .
you ca n't leave them out there .
victor , are you feeling alright ?
just < u > find < /u > him .
i told you , i 'm fine .
it is .
oh , i think you already have .
i know it ca n't be easy .
for your sake i hope you 're right .
skeptical ... ?
here 's the overall target area ...
medical 's ready .
phase two .
no ...
but it 's hopeless !
i know that . but what 's the maximum ?
nothing -- compared to starting it up again .
i ca n't help it .
what 're you getting at ?
i 'd hold that off awhile .
well , how about hypnosis ?
the pentagon , was n't it , general ?
the other side got to him .
how bad off is he ?
brain injury .
before or after what he wanted to tell you ?
before he could breathe a word .
< me > ?
sorry , but i 'm rusty on surgeons .
cora peterson , his technical assistant .
what can i do ? except maybe pass out ?
tell him where he fits in , will you ?
come along , they 'll be operating shortly .
no question of her loyalty .
say that again ?
that 's right .
they 're bound to try again .
trip ? where to ?
as part of the crew .
wait a minute !
grant , our miniaturizer can shrink anything .
but i do n't want to be miniaturized -- !
it 's only for an hour --
not even for a minute !
yes ?
where can i get a cab back to town ?
he 's blanked out on that one particular point .
why do n't you go on .
meet grant .
i do n't agree .
difficult ? he 's impossible !
that 's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty .
yes ... slowed down agreat deal .
it must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool .
we 'll know -- in the next breath ...
we must !
with no laser --
yes , there 's no time to spare .
yes , cora .
i -- i want to say ...
they 're much smaller than bacteria ...
no danger of an embolism .
i do n't know yet , doctor .
he certainly is .
i 'll take some laughing gas , ma'am .
you may learn to like it .
now i know ...
not working for someone like dr. duval --
doctor -- is it possible ?
i have no idea .
not now . we need air , not greetings !
you ca n't -- it 's too dangerous --
not anything built into the chassis .
a surgeon might ...
oh yes , i 'm sure dr. duval could .
i 've got a source .
i ca n't till the hatch is flooded !
i feel much better now ...
that 's what they pay me for .
a great deal more than that , i believe ...
keeping an eye on dr. duval ...
what gives you that idea ?
as obvious as that ?
oh , no . plenty of cause .
look !
i ca n't breathe ! ...
it 's too late now .
i do n't agree .
not in a sealed vessel like an artery .
nothing -- against all that force .
if we can go in past the oculomotor nerve ...
better judgment ? !
all i 'm asking is you test it beforehand !
i 'll do nothing of the sort !
you left something out .
what 's that ?
the breath of god ...
we have no alternative .
you mean inner space is endless ?
quite a piece of plumbing .
oxygenation ...
no , there 's no other way .
what about dr. michaels ?
it 's too late !
at an operation ?
they know they failed to kill benes .
how are you , miss peterson ?
a forced joining of an artery and vein .
if there 's any chance --
request removal , mr. grant .
it lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime .
fasten yourselves in .
well , we better get on with it .
send the following message ...
let 's hope ...
i saw the laser just before we started .
that line was tampered with ...
i -- i do n't know what to say .
two in a row ?
it 's possible --
just what it is .
once time 's up , de-miniaturization begins .
why not ?
where we going ?
i ca n't tell you that either ...
go ahead .
i 'm married .
and she said it was indelible ...
that makes two of us .
nothing you could see with the naked eye .
positions , please . and strap yourselves in .
enough to breathe , but that 's all .
dr. michaels ... he went berserk ...
berserk nothing .
we can get out through the lab section .
uh -- what ?
we feel great , do n't we ?
oh -- sure , sure ! never better !
nothing wrong with us ! not a thing !
we 're losing pressure in the flotation tanks .
what i was afraid would happen .
i could use a lawnmower ...
looks simple to operate .
was there any damage ?
not to the valve .
yes , by all means .
i 'll do what i can .
we 're entering a capillary .
the wall 's transparent ...
fluid is seeping through .
may i have your ticket , please ?

more or less .
what are you going to do ?
improvise , of course .

yeah .
time to check out the waiters .
i think i 'll pass .
but ... wait a minute !

rennie 's not coming .

we have to get off this ship ! !
do n't be ridiculous !
perfectly .
nothing .
i packed it . just for us .
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up .

and neither do you .
no , i think it 's just the beginning .
oh , i can see that .
oh dear god ...
what are you talking about ?
use some common sense !
nothing ! i went to her cabin and ...
perfect for a swim , is n't it ?
oh , he is indeed .
am i ? let 's find out .
you can and you will ! swim , rennie !
why are you doing this to yourself ?
i 'm staying .
but sean said ...
i 'm the one you should be listening to !
i ... i ca n't ...
you can and you will ! !
i was only trying to teach you .
me too .
you let me worry about him , okay ?
what about not-so-great writers ?
just felt a little chill .
really ?
no , but i 'm sure toby 's fine .
yeah ... a lot .
there 's something i have n't told you ...
i gathered that .
it 's not that simple .
maybe not .
about four years ago ... at crystal lake .
no . it was just a normal summer .
i ... i do n't know ...
hi , sean .
i heard you were n't coming .
we changed our minds .
but i did n't get you one ...
forget it .
i 'd love to .
the bow ... front of the ship .
just radio for help , okay ? ? ?
the window ...
is the ship going to sink ? ?
but rennie ...
i 'm not ! !
drugs ... then jason came .
please , hurry ...
where you 're going , mister ?
very big .
i opened thousands of brains .
what did you find ?
big mess every time .
i loved my taxi . went twelve hours nonstop .
you are going where ?
crosstown .
very bad today .
what do you mean , we must abandon ?
ruptured steam pipe .
contaminated substance . very dangerous . shooting mud .
do not inhale .
i was barrister in kenya .
that 's where i peed .
paisley porter .
elliot ?
this is a great young out-of-work actress .
elliot litvak . have you been ill ?
alla puttanesca .
is n't she great ?
i do n't want to hear about it .
shut up , elliot .
quietly effective .
press a button and they give us money .
ride with me . we need a haircut .
she wants a divorce .
do n't talk like that .
it 's over , finished and done with .
that sounds so final .
i 'm completely stunned .
but did n't we know it would happen ?
do n't needle me , elliot .
joanna bourne . so rich and crisp .
asbestos lining .
we must abandon .
do not inhale .
what do i exude ?
suffering .
tonight . what 's tonight ?
shit . they do n't have any carrot soup .
you mean because what's-his-name .
you will suffer because he is in the theater .
it is just a review . do not inhale .
what 's the fuss ?
that 's what i said eighteen months ago .
what happened eighteen months ago ?
before his broadway days .
and he was there ?
steven schwimmer .
that 's awful .
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish .
a year and a half later ?
i said , `i 'm dead ' .
do we care ?
i think we nought to wait .
i say we go .
you say we go ?
do not inhale .
i 'm not ready .
here we go .
i do n't have the problems that artists have .
do n't wait efor me .
what about the haircut ?
then you should carry a gun .
i gave it away .
that was a big mistake .
no , we 're not .
i 'm not a lonely spooky writer like you .
we 're talking about something deeper than grudges .
it 's your best play , nicky .
he 'll hate it .
he 'll kill it .
what ?
the american theater does n't need people like that .
shoot him , nicky .
keep going west . last building before the river .
how do you eknow .
paisley porter .
what do you mean ?
about an hour and a half ago .
had to be him .
she was very evasive .
unbelievable .
classic .
what are you talking about ?
what are we talking about ?
yes . what are you implying ?
did you see the winning run score ?
you 're not making sense . make sense .
this could be it .
let 's work on it .
let 's work on it .
this could be it .
this could be it .
this could be it .
this could be it .
does it feel comfortable ?
does what feel comfortable ?
this could be it .
this could be it .
i hear alan 's sick .
alan 's very sick .
what about her ?
she 's dying .
she died .
i talked to her two days ago .
apparently it did n't help .
our peter ?
peter redmond .
they 're watching him closely .
i 've got bigger problems , joanna .
that 's not all , nicky .
about what ?
steven schwimmer .
the red sox
you mean the world series ?
three games to two .
this is how we 've managed to last .
we 're able to surprise each other .
in and out of bed .
because we 're completely mismatched .
it 's all worked out .
it 's your best play , nicky .
they 'll lose because they 're my team .
he will absolutely hate it .
i go to college . i thought you knew .
do you want to get some coffee ?
i do n't drink coffee , daddy .
why do you need a radio ?
is it ?
do n't talk like that . how prominent ?
she 's doing like those iranians .
do n't be so steely-eyed .
oh please . not now .
you 're too young to be studying criminal behavior .
she is kicking you out .
do n't call her mother all the time .
i did n't turn her into mother .
thanks , daddy . but i just need one .
opening night ?
take it yourself . take a date .
i do n't have a date .
i have a class . i 'm late .
can we talk later ?
i 'm not sure .
except i wo n't have a father anymore .
i 'll see you all the time .
everything .
there 's nothing left for me to lie about .
it 's only our first date .
names are incredibly intimate .
brilliantly moving .
packs an emotional wallop .
what else ?
a flat-out hit .
yes .
this building is not secure .
what do we want ?
mystery . deception .
deception is n't something i personally consider sexy .
what 's sexy ?
knowing who a person is . down deep .
yes .
it 's your best play , nicky .
see , daddy .
i 've seen it twice .
what else ?
an artistry and sensitivity you 've never shown before .
and peter redmond helped immensely .
two-all after six .
i want to be fair-minded , nicky .
all right . what 's been going on ?
i 've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer .
how prominent ?
he has his own submarine .
bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning .
who the hell cares ?
the whole thing is my fault .
that 's always been my problem .
and you 've been extremely patient .
you know why , do n't you ?
you smoked because i smoked .
i 'd forgotten that .
i went because you went .
that 's very lovely actually .
laurel wants us to be honest and open .
be open with me . i 'd like that .
alma wetzel .
nicky , no . this is insupportable .
i 'm a man .
she 's my gynecologist .
it violates so many trusts .
it was an animal thing . no real intimacy .
i 'm glad we 're having this talk .
i feel great . i feel impeccably alive .
they 're always winning . until they lose .
life is good .
i do n't know if i can say that .
washed away .
one more out .
a thousand things .
you 're hurting my head .
this could be it !
life is real .
i 'm at the door .
go way . i 'll call a cop .
pop , will you let me in ?
where the hell are you ?
right here . at the door .
it 's me . nicky .
nicky comes on sunday 's .
where are your glasses ? go get them .
where does nicky get his hair cut ?
get yourself something to eat .
five 's not so many .
lillian says it once a week .
you know the answer to that .
i do know the answer to that .
they 're only gon na lose .
of course they 're gon na lose .
it 's all connected , pop .
i could have grown up happy .
since when did that matter ?
let 's not start that again .
my back is killing me .
where 's your elastic brace ?
i ca n't find it .
i 'll go get you another one .
i know , pop .
i think the building 's okay .
so what are you going to do about it ?
what do you want me to do ?
show him who we are .
everybody else does . why not you ?
you 're frankie lazzaro .
oh yeah ?
matthew , look at him .
the most charming gangster in new england .
call me frankie .
might be an accident on the west side highway .
how come you got the kid with you ?
matthew 's my grandson .
a grandmother . god bless you .
he does bless me , each and every day .
it 's the kid 's lucky day .
this is one charming crook .
now that 's a complicated subject .
that 's a simple subject .
look , we 're stuck here front and back .
you 're charming the boy .
hey , toyota . he asked me a question .
frankie lazzaro .
that 's my cousin , angelo .
it 's complicated . it 's a whole life .
wife and daughter . my father 's still alive .
it 's a simple subject .
winning is easy . losing is complicated .
i want to believe .
life is good .
speak it like it 's real . matthew .
matthew .
because god loves a winner .
he used to love losers .
washed away .
because life is good .
because faith is rewarded .
it 's a test all right .
this could be it !
why does it matter ?
if they lost tonight , they 'll lose tomorrow .
why do you care ?
they 're my team .
no . they 're not your team .
the red sox were my world .
because i ca n't bear to watch .
joanna loves this play .
appreciate that , sidney .
hat was this morning .
so what happened since ?
well i am . worried sick .
postpone . we have every right .
too late . all the elements are in place .
i 've had three straight washouts , sidney .
how come ?
when the mets lose , they just lose .
hurry back . hurry back to what ?
eleventh inning . what else ?
you 're not making sense .
to go to the theater .
why ?
get the hell out of here .
sidney .
sidney fabrikant . our producer .
i was educated by nuns .
yes .
i have excellent long-term memory .
yes .
i kissed shirley felder on the teeth .
yes , peter .
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories .
you have to see the words .
what was your favorite color crayon , growing up ?
burnt sienna .
mine was cobalt blue .
this is your history , is n't it ?
yes .
i kissed her while she was laughing .
yes .
i can see her face so clearly .
i know it sounds easy .
we have a very nice pasta today .
i was in the fish-market play .
there was a review .
i think i remember .
so does elliot .
not one of steven 's finer moments .
oh . you know him .
a little .
and he has finer moments now and then .
he has -- something .
endearing .
engaging .
elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike .
a little drastic maybe ?
say it again .
what ?
you know what .
alla puttanesca .
one more time .
i was one of those silent , listening children .
i was all noise . played the radio loud .
i hear good things about the new play .
so do i . over and over .
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously .
would you like to meet him ?
the fact is , i have to get going .
is it true ?
is what true ?
he wears a disguise .
steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy .
but you 're his friend .
sort of . sometimes .
i do n't know .
he 's a very sweet man .
where are you going now ?
home .
someone waiting for you ?
no one 's waiting .
but you do n't even know me .
i know you both . enough .
yes .
never mind .
our steven not only disguises himself .
yes .
he goes to the theater armed .
i 'm actually beginning to enjoy this .
i have n't come to you .
but you 're here .
of course it 's unfair .
not if you stopped hurting people .
the truth is never gentle .
i 'm going home to my machine .
as i told you about english policemen .
they are boys . -- and they 're indian .
yes -- i ca n't talk like this .
mr. khan said they called you brave .
it is the work of untouchables .
all the more reason .
there 's no room !
eleven .
stop !
jinnah has -- has cooperated with the british .
no .
what do you expect when you talk like that ?
one more .
i -- i mean it 's all right .
yes .
not anymore .
i thought you were a man of god .
i am .
going nearer to god !
did they take your clothes ?
it does .
back in south africa ... long time ago .
what was he like ?
he said he 's in charge ...
`` hell ! ''
no -- neither do i .
no , no -- just a moment , please .
we must end the campaign .
he 's waiting .
hm .
you will respect the law .
i hope not .
even as a boy i thought so .
perhaps .
a great deal .
my name is walk-er .
i would rather march .
first spin .
i do n't know ...
i mean a day of prayer and fasting .
that 's young nehru .
oh , yes , you are .
there is nothing i can give .
allah be praised .
no . you were the surprise .
my wife publicly defied the law .
the fools ! sorry ...
it 's split the government .
well , that 's one victory .
thank you . no .
i dined at the prison .
ahh .
somehow i expected not .
very well .
yes -- yes .
who 's leading them ?
i do n't know !
he 's `` discovering '' india .
no -- but i think i 'm going to .
have you found him ?
bapu -- please . where are you going .
come with me now , vincent .
there are a few million miles to go yet .
it 's over .
you did n't beat me that day .
who are you trying to convince ?
i will prove it to you .
too late for that .
it would be five thousand more .
no ? what 's keeping you ?
i guess i 'm a slow learner .
i guess so .
of course , sir .
who knows with these `` deficients '' ?
what a pity .
we 're already getting complaints about frivolous search .
this is a murder investigation .
a customer ?
no .
none of the id photos match the enhancement .
blood . from the vein .
something 's not right .
he 's not here .
no , we 've missed something .
we do n't have the manpower .
get it .
from what budget ?
where do we start ?
we 'll vacuum these streets if we have to .
so we have two choices .
luca could still be an accomplice .
often .
surely you know what you have .
we have to be certain .
what a relief .
thank you , no .
this time i will supervise each test personally .
jerome -- ?
hello , sweatheart . come on up .
it 's about the director .
again ?
what 's wrong with him ?
you have more in common than you know .
he 's too tall .
yeah . you want to go dancing tonight ?
i think i 'd better choose the menu .
at least you 're honest .
what about this ?
wrong color . it 's silver .
you had to be a right-hander .
noone orders southpaws anymore .
< i > more < /i > than that .
god , you 're serious , are n't you ?
listen , i bag this stuff anyway .
the mission director .
you wish .
he was still warm when they confirmed .
this calls for a celebration . does n't it ?
the place is crawling with hoovers .
so what ?
hey , how much of you can be there ?
keep going ! ! keep going ! !
and drinking it .
you know i 'm scared of heights .
it 's okay , eugene .
-- i walked right in front of it .
i 'm proud of you , vincent .
any particular reason ?
we ca n't stay here .
what are you talking about ?
they think i offed the director .
they found my eyelash .
where ?
in a corridor .
could be worse .
i 'm not going anywhere .
where is your head , jerome ?
how could they recognize you ?
i 'm sorry . i think i was crying .
i 'm sure i could have .
is that all ?
i 've got enough on my mind without that .
if you say so . the stripe .
good choice .
never stopped you before .
complicated . i could n't stop her apologizing .
i 'm sorry . i 've got plans .
again ?
she 's already got her doubts .
i 'm sure you 'll be very convincing .
michael 's .
you may as well invite her here .
will you be okay ?
do n't worry about your little pin cushion .
how long ?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get here .
i could always walk .
have you forgotten ?
in case you get back before i do .
where are you going ?
i 'm travelling too .
i got the better end of the deal .
i understand .
i have to caution you it 's not fool-proof .
german , is that you ?
vincent , come down . i 've found him .
i hope he 's not just a body .
no problem .
it happened in australasia . he checked in yesterday .
i 'd have to bleach my hair .
why are you inventing problems ?
even with lifts i 'm never that tall .
there 's a way .
these new personality corrections i 've been reading about .
you worried about the cost ?
not that .
they said the same thing about myopia and obesity .
i 've found him too .
a fingerprint .
no it ca n't be verified .
were < i > you < /i > alone ?
yes .
why do n't we say we were together ?
why would we do that ?
we were just looking .
i know about you .
friend ?
it was a mercy-killing after all .
they found an eyelash .
where ?
in the south wing .
does it have a name ?
just some in-valid . vincent -- -- somebody .
you celebrate , jerome ?
yes ... < i > yes < /i > ...
you 're angry --
why would i be angry ? it was beautiful .
you 'll be next .
i do n't think so .
nothing yet .
of course .
i guess somebody beat me to it .
those checks take forever .
let 's walk .
who are they ?
it 's not safe .
come on .
my medication . i left it back there .
we 'll get it later . irene , please .
you remember the '99 chrysler lebaron ?
so you 're not so smart after all .
you hypocrite .
i forgot something -- something at home .
we could go together one day .
not so long -- just once around the sun .
only every time i 'm in here .
new policy .
there 's a problem , lamar .
i ca n't do this .
i told you , the government pays .
no , you do n't understand .
i 'm not doing it .
antonio --
hard to judge how these things happen .
i get my own help .
they 're mine .
i heard about you . you work with miller .
i 'll take care of my end .
stay clean .
beynon .
news said two persons killed .
and you got him ...

yeah ? what were some of your movies ?
this and that .
still . you must be rich .
merely comfortable . here 's hanna with our refreshments .
what did she mean by going flooey ?
i returned recently from a stay in hospital .
what was wrong ?
nothing serious . a touch of stroke .
huh ?
to an artistic eye , you understand .
you mean , like posed for pictures ?
sat for an artist . been sketched .
what 's to sketch ?
you have the most architectural skull .
broke is more like it .
but expressively broken . how did it happen ?
football in college .
you went to university ?
just a year .
yes . you were a marine .
you mean -- you really want to draw me ?
indeed .
what are you suggesting ?
excellent . we 'll have a most interesting time .
you do n't say ? which picture ?
`` bride of frankenstein . ''
hmmm .
it 's new .
i 'm sorry .
pish posh , mr. boone .
all right already . i 'll take it off .
that 's exactly what i intend to do .
no . i 'm fine .
sounds like something you feed the dog .
it is .
your family ate dripping ?
of course not .
we were n't rich .
all right , i guess .
go ahead .
this david 's a friend ?
yes . an old , useless friend .
did you now ?
i liked it . we all did .
did anyone laugh ?
no .
pity . people are so earnest nowadays .
why ? was it supposed to be funny ?
of course .
i do n't like to talk about that .
proud ?
quite true . hand-to-hand combat is the true test .

full up .
ca n't today .
i 'll pay our going rate .
all righty . i understand .

or a husband .
no , i -- you 're a homosexual .
oh dear .
i 'm not , you know .
i never thought you were .
you know .
what you do is no business of mine .
it will only make you self-conscious .
sorry . not today .
but we have to match the other sketch .
i just feel more comfortable keeping it on .
not at the moment .
why not ?
you know how it is .
the world is just one kiss-ass game after another .
thoreau with a lawnmower .
i like that .
in a way , yes . i suppose so .
what happened ?
the fucking studio butchered it .
it 's so far in the past now .
how long were you ... ?
twenty years . too long .
cut it out !
you first .
oh no . i never swim .
i do n't know .
everybody has stories to tell .
not me .
what about your stint in korea ?
i told you .
not fear . more like disgust .
same difference , mr. boone .
no teammates in football ? no comrades in korea ?
you must think the whole world is queer .
not at all .
you were a soldier ?
i was an officer .
no , my dear . the crimean war .
something happened to him ?
i did n't --
why do i tell you this ?
you 're very clever , mr. boone .
you asked me to model . remember ?
of course i remember .
i do n't get it .
i want -- i want ...
no harm done .
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait .
very good , clayton .
clayton is fine .
do i look okay ?
if that 's okay ?
nothing would please me more .
i do n't hear anything .
exactly . cukor was too cheap to hire music .
nothing of importance .
david .
no . the girl .
girl ? oh . elizabeth taylor .
david produced her last picture .
actually , no .
neither of us really belongs here .
must have been funny for you .
monsters ? the only monsters ... ... are here .

ca n't you see ? it 's raining !
you do n't want to wait it out ?
we 're not sugar . we wo n't melt .
just a night out .
ten minutes ago .
i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
you do n't have any baggy shorts ?
sorry . my pajamas are tailored .
do i have any other choice ?
very sporting of you , clayton .
the only memento i ever kept .
i thought you 'd given up on my picture .
i 'd like to try again .
why not ?
never gave it much thought .
come now .
but you said --
-- that i was a marine .
i see .
the great war ?
a very lucky thing indeed .
that 's not the way he saw it .
what happened ?
i did n't have the guts for it .
i 'm very sorry .
them 's the breaks , right ?
that 's where you 're wrong , clayton .
not at all .
`` a perfect night for mystery and horror .
that 's from your movie , right ?
i do n't remember that one .
james whale . this afternoon at the party .
i do n't recall .
but that was so long ago .
oh , but it does .
your friend ?
you survived it .
oh no , my friend .
what 'd you say ?
what wo n't do ?
you are much too human .
what did you expect ? bronze ?
do n't move .
for the artistic effect .
i do n't know .
please , clayton . just for a minute .
what was that ?
it 's too tight .
relax , clayton . i ca n't hear you .
oh , but you feel good , clayton .
i have n't done a damn thing with you !
oh , but you have .
you 're crazy .
oh clayton .

tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow ...

a missionary 's widow ?
her son drowned .

but , mrs. rand --
i knew you 'd come .
i asked you to let me explain .
but you did n't have to come up here .
perhaps not .
that 's sweet of you , mrs. rand .
you must , betsy .
mrs. rand was at the houmfort that night .
i do n't know .
i 've never heard of a cure .
is this disease common in the tropics ?
fortunately , not .
i would have stayed anyway , dr. maxwell .
yes .
where were you trained ?
at the memorial hospital -- here in ottawa .
no , this is quite final .
that 's rather nice , is n't it ?
yes -- on the boat .
is she a doctor ?
no -- she just runs the place .
i like her already .
and that -- is my chair .
my brother 's wife .
i went to school in buffalo .
i wondered about your different accents .
of course .
mr. holland ?
yes , the redoubtable paul .
it 'll wait .
it 's my day off .
higher mathematics .
wait . i want to listen .
did you hear what he sang ?
why ? everybody else knows it .
i 'd like to go now , rand .
of course , wes .
i do n't know .
but she 's not dead , wes .
you know what she is !
jessica was never any good for paul .
you read my thoughts , mr. holland .
yes , thank you .
no , thank you .
a woman crying ?
i 'm not sure i can make you understand .
a figure of st. sebastian .

and charming ?
i 've never given it much thought .

good morning .
yes , he can .
i often do .
i know what you went through tonight .
i do n't know .
you did n't drive her mad .
did n't i ? i do n't know .
i imagined this so differently ...
help me ? how ?
i took mrs. holland to the houmfort .
you have deliberately endangered mrs. holland 's life .
i told you .
you know why .
i hated her .
you ca n't believe that .
how do you know i 'm not ?
no .
yes .
this is something else . they 're curious .
i hated myself .
you were possessed .
no -- it 's about mrs. holland .
of the nature of mrs. holland 's illness .
maybe it 's better this way , mother .
emotion tricks all of us , mrs. rand .
because he drove jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly !
dr. maxwell has very unpleasant news for us .
are you going to lie for him , mother ?
betsy , tell them about the houmfort .
that night , i went to the houmfort .
got a meeting uptown .

we were like sisters .
must be tough for you . what happened .
long as it 's fun .

who was kay seeing besides randy stetz ?
you do n't know .
she would n't tell me !
what was ?
my arm !
who ?
she used some stupid code name .
what was it ?
the phone call . the knapsack .
you 're going to be brought in for questioning .
yes down at the station .
but she was an attractive girl .
i suppose .
did you have sex with her ?
but you wanted to .
i was a mentor to her .
yes .
expensive dresses . a heart necklace .
yes .
does n't sound like a mentor to me .
i gave her things she did n't have .
he . well , he ...
told you i could write an ending .
congratulations .
there 's nothing more to talk about .
but we work so well together ...
kay told me .
then so was mine ...
do n't you pull that shit with me .
i did n't want to kill her , will .
it was when i went to kiss her .
this an accident , walter ?
if you want it to be ...
no back-up .
you 're not following procedure .
procedure went out the window a long time ago .
drop the gun , walter .
yes , and very beautiful .
your lips , they did n't move .
we had feared we were the only ones ...
but how did you come into existence ?
ah ! you have questions ?
what are we ?
nothing if not vampires ...
who made us what we are ?
surely you know the one who made you ...
you mean we are not children of satan ?
no .
perhaps ...
then god does not exist ...
i have not spoken to him ...
you fell too much .
knew ? you mean he is ...
listen to me .
your lover .
no , my beloved , my child .
if you say so . you are innocent .
i 'm not innocent . but i 'm afraid .
she is .
but why ?
i could give you reasons . her silence .
did you kill this vampire who made you both ?
we want no quarrel with him .
it 's already begun .
you said there were none .
but you asked the wrong questions .
we can do that ?
you would never give up life .
that 's what the one who made me said .
how he must have loved you .
like moths around the candle of the age .
yes ... my god ...
a vampire with a human soul .
lestat ! you knew lestat !
yes i knew him .
follow me - that way - through my cell -
i ca n't save her .
you ca n't believe i 'd leave without her .
louis , i ca n't save her .
i do n't believe you .
louis , i swear i did not .
i understand you only too well .
no .
and yet you knew what i would o .
i knew .
you were their leader . they trusted you .
you made me see their failings , louis .
what a pair we are .
yes , cherie , of course you want more .
yes you are , my dearest .
what night ? what do you mean ?
is this my birthday ?
i have .
but you 're the fairest by far .
you dress me like a doll .
what you are ?
and if i cut my hair again ?
it will grow back again !
but it was n't always so !
did you do it to me ? ? ? ?
be glad i made you what you are !
does it ?
yes . and i 'll tell you something else !
you 're spoilt because you 're an only child .
you 're a liar .
what plans ?
oh , lestat .
drunk on brandy wine . a thimblefull .
we forgive each other then ?
no . laudanum .
yes . it killed them , unfortunately .
louis , put me in my coffin ...
i 'll put you in your coffin . forever .
what have you done ?
the way i learn everything . by watching you .
he jests .
why does he call you that ?
hush , claudia do n't talk about such things .
sit still . it 's not finished -
claudia - do n't -
why not ?
and he found me with you .
you both did it ?
i took your life .
he 'll never let us go .
do n't mock me , louis . help me .
the one good lesson he taught me , louis .
do n't mock , claudia ...
the swamp ...
then maybe so do we .
i did it for us , louis .
i ca n't . go away from me .
tell me you do n't hate me louis .
it is ! take the back stairwell -
not yet .
still my beautiful child .
yes ...
well tell me , papa .
but how will i ever know , louis ?
they are ducklings , that will grow into swans .
you are more beautiful than any of them .
you are neither , claudia . now stop this --
yes . should i take her , louis ?
come , claudia ...
nonsense all right .
they are here . i know they are .
how devilishly clever .
no . she 's frightened .
and no one knows but us ...
yes , and very beautiful .
be still !
i can feel it from them !
no , you would not , louis .
love holds you to me .
love ?
he wants you as you want him .
so you felt it too !
let him go , he said .
you really believe that ?
do n't make me , claudia !
yet you could do it to me !
yes ...
it 's only mortal death .
what do you mean ?
then my luck would have changed .
you want death ? is it death you want ?
yes ...
and a beautiful house it is too .
why should i be ?
i 've come to answer your prayers .
they are gone , louis . death took them .
no ! ! ! ! !
vampires . we thrive on blood .
i want it !
how do you mean , start ?
call him .
i ca n't do it .
you 've just done it -
i wish i were .
but why do you want me ?
yes . kill me .
you asked for death .
yes ...
sure ...
dying ?
i want a woman .
the crucifix -
forget the crucifix . take him .
you have fed . you were made for this ...
you 've killed louis . and enjoyed it .
give it time .
do you think so ?
we can live like this ?
yes . and i 'm bored with this prattle --
anything is possible .
of course not .
but how do you know ?
read her thoughts .
i ca n't .
the dark gift is different for each of us .
i do n't know any hell -
paris ? you came from paris ?
as did the one who made me .
tell me about him .
i respect life , do n't you see ?
respect me a little then .
what you would n't do .
where do you think , my idiot friend ?
i 'm not interested in you .
i do n't pretend to know .
vampires are killers .
i know . let her alone .
i like to do it . i enjoy it .
you finish her - if you feel so much -
no ! ! !
then you kill her ! ! ! ! !
no ...
that and more .
what are you saying ?
you need company , louis .
that 's enough , cherie .
you are the devil !
shhhh !
are you mad ? ? ? ?
do n't try to speak ... it 's alright ...
yes .
do n't fear me , lestat .
you 've come back to me , louis ?
i ca n't bear it louis !
and they frighten you ?
you know i love the dark .
it 's false light , lestat .
you have it ...
so much the better .
you followed me here , did n't you ?
saw you in the street outside .
it 's just a room ...
so shall we begin ? what do yo do ?
i 'm a vampire .
absolutely . i was watching you watching me .
well , what a lucky break for me .
perhaps lucky for both of us .
yes but you need n't worry about that now .
we ca n't begin this way .
but i thought vampires did n't like the light .
we love it .
the same way you do it .
why should i lie ?
yes .
but times were different then .
oh , that rumour about crosses ?
you ca n't look at them ...
nonsense , my friend .
the story about stakes through the heart ?
the same .
what about coffins ?
coffins ... coffins unfortunately are a necessity ...
can a vampire feel love ?
you loved your wife , surely .
i was human then .
he did it to make you stay with him !
perhaps . he knew me .
how could i not ? she had to know .
and did you lose her ? did she go ?
where would she have gone ?
he was dead to us . we were free .
no vampires in transylvania ? no count dracula ?
fictions , my friend .
he had n't even been there .
but it has .
it 's over , i 'm telling you ...
no ...
do n't say anymore .
yes ...
and you know what you ask for ?
what do you think she is , madeleine ?
a child who ca n't die ...
my daughter ...
yes !
checking in ... karla wilson .

not at all . those are our honeymoon suites .
july fourth weekend . storm season starts today .
sorry . emergencies only .
what the hell would you call this ?
honeymoon suites .
it 's our version of winter .
who ? who is here ?
not possible , i 'm afraid .
phones went down a few minutes ago .
stupid . what were you thinkng ?
no .
the guy looks dead .
storm is what makes it interesting .
up-tighteous and self-righteous .
what are you doing in my closet ?
what are you doing in my closet ?
no .
yeah , right -- whatever .
i think i just really hurt ray 's feelings .

okay , okay . you 're right .
i know it , and it feels good .

a friend . we were vacationing .
we called everyone , did everything we could .
nothing you have n't seen before .
twenty , twenty-fire pounds .
you hate to swim .
people change .
so do you .
well we should split up or something .
no , dr. grant says ...
dr. grant says this , dr. grant says that ...
what ?
nothing .
what did you say ?
nothing .
what did you say !
just drop it paul !
eric ...
i filmed this the morning they left .
i know you liked ben .
its not about him . it 's eric .
eric !
he 's this way .
we have to help him .
well damn it .
that one time was just the bumper .
he would have been , safe .
when did you have it last ?
i do n't remember
think .
i loaned it to nash .
never had a doubt . never did .
we 're not going anywhere , i promise .
i 'm trying !
i should have tried .
he could have died .
but he did n't . and neither did you .
you mean it ?
i do . it 's worth another shot .
how low ?
who 's that ?
here !
what about eric and dr. grant ?
going to the coast was alan 's idea .
where is it ?
dad !
just hold on .
i know . i know .
then we should ...
okay . he loves us very very much .
i did n't know , there were two islands .
about a thousand feet above it , actually .
i thought you were an expert .
dr. grant was .
sure .
it wo n't hold !
we 'll be broke in four weeks .
three weeks . i had to rent some equipment .
it 's a rapid prototyper .
not if it ca n't dig .
they 're here .
what ?
that does sound lucky .
it was this strap alone that saved my life .
reverse-darwinism . survival of the most idiotic .
mr. and mrs. kirby !
i do n't think so .
obviously a superpredator . suchimimus . that snout .
they never got that big .
baryonyx ?
not with that sail . spinosaurus aegypticus .
i do n't remember that on ingen 's list .
that 's because it was n't on their list .
ah yes , the first rule of academics .
keep going !
no !
i know the consequences !
he 's three .
sorry , alan it 's been six years .
raptors , mostly .
my favorite .
i try not to .
you think they could talk to each other ?
to a degree we never imagined .
times change alan .
the last of my breed .
let me know if i can help , alan .
okay . goodbye , ellie .
goodbye , alan .
a well-accepted theory .
alan do n't be afraid to evolve .
in costa rica ?
on the island .
which one do you prefer ?
the first one .
it 's a wonder you are n't .
the important thing is we both made it .
yeah .
what did you think ?
i dunno .
a raptor claw . i use to have one .
mine 's new .
are you sure ?
why ?
no .
see , i was the opposite .
exactly .
something must 've scared them .
you 're right .
no . i could n't see .
do me a favor .
no we 're not .
i guarantee it 'll be worth your while .
establishing a perimeter . making it safe .
i have never been on this island !
sure you have . you wrote that book ...
there is .
but you never came across just one .
back out ! move !
it 's no use , dr. grant .
stan .
how do you mean ?
it certainly does .
if the nest is upwind , so are we .
no . i feel something .
minimal .
`` minimal '' is too much .
you are an academic .
former academic . now i actually make things .
you think i 'm all talk , eddie ?
it does n't matter what i think .
is there anything we 've forgotten ?
like if you shoot yourself in the foot ?
because i did n't know !
it 's the lawyers .
they do have motives .
you were right -- and i was wrong .
well ?
the hatchery , in particular ?
john . . .
-- my --
-humidity , i know .
is that who we 're really working for ? !
you got ta be kidding .
everyone , keep your voices down !
we 've got to see one to find out .
kelly ! what are you doing here ?
well , i do , and she 's fantastic .
stop saying fantastic . where are you going ?
i ca n't tell you .
my vacation is over in a week .
i 'll make it up to you this summer .
very hurtful .
no , dad .
which one ?
you know , at the bus stop .
that was about a year ago .
well , is he ?
no . richard talked to his parents .
that richard .
out of the question .
because you said so .
where does it say that ?
on the side of that one truck .
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do .
i 'm fine ... i 'm fine ...
come on !
what ? why ?
okay .
good lad .
to collect my fee .
my father 's .600 nitro express .
how close do you have to be ?
forty yards . less , maybe .
rex wo n't be any different .
you 're kidding yourself .
you 've broken its leg !
we 've got to transport it seven thousand miles .
is n't it obvious ?
the velociraptors .
piss .
operations building . far end of the street .
why ?
it 's just fed .
you cost me my livelihood .
there are no versions of the truth !
it was a payoff and an insult .
piss .
oh , god .
do n't ask me .
she 's nuts .
oh , my god .
our chance to do what ?
it has a broken leg !
what do you think they want ? !
no way .
no .
what are they ?
i do n't know .
where 's kelly ?
she 's with sarah !
it 'll hold !
for sixty seconds , maybe ! look at this !
i have to find kelly !
i think she 's with sarah !
damn it , be sure ! !
look ! sarah !
look , we have two choices .
what 's that ?
a statistical phenomenon .
feeling a bit blue , are we ?
why did you come here ?
so that others would know about this place ?
why should they ?
because it exists .
but why ?
it 's called self-testing .
four , counting the one in the chamber .
do n't let it out of your hands again .
now 's the perfect time .
funded by whom ?
john hammond .
are you insane ? !
they will come after me .
what ? !
they 're pushing us over the cliff .
maybe . maybe not .
what ?
these formations . they 're dried --
birdshit ?
that must be interesting . what drew you there ?
women . 'bout eighty percent female in greenpeace .
very noble of you .
oh , please .
oh , no !
that little black line means death for this infant .
i 'm trying !
no .
jump !
where 's ian ?
can the kid walk ?
stop the program ! stop the program !
you 're sure we have to ?
it 's not worth taking the chance , john .
damn !
it could have been worse , john .
the door security systems are shutting down .
fences are failing , all over the park !
find nedry ! check the vending machines !
the monitors are failing .
where did the vehicles stop ?
i will not do it .
uh - - about two million .
two million - - great . that would help .
yeah , again , in theory , but - -
no trick to it .
'bout thirty seconds .
dodgson , dodgson . we got dodgson here !
remember - - viable embryos .
mr nedry , mr nedry .
shhhhh !
anybody at all . feel free to speak up .
six weeks ?
these are dilated . take a look .
they are ? i 'll be damned .
that 's pharmacological . from local plant life .
pretty sure .
there 's only one way to be positive .
you wo n't be able to miss them .
come along .
oh my god .
could i have a tissue please ?
oh my god .
give time , they 'll out draw the t-rex .
we 're - - still perfecting a viewing system .
they 'll all be fine .
a carousel - - and a seesaw .
but you ca n't think through this one .
you 're absolutely right .
control ? ! you never had control !
good ! keep going , now .
they died together ?
the taphonomy sure looks that way .
if they died together , they lived together .
that 's good . that 's right !
yes . good shape , too .
oh , ellie , look .
they smell .
oh my god , they do not !
they do smell .
the cretaceous .
anything else , you old fossil ?
yeah , plenty .
small versions of adults , honey .
what kind of park is it ?
the - - agility . you 're right !
they were wrong . case closed .
say again ?
we were right !
how did you do it ? !
we 're out of a job .
ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? !
dilophosaurus .
it 's my favorite .
not just every six weeks .

i 'll just finish .
ellie , get the gun !
i ca n't get it !
that 's right .

the other car !
alan !
i do n't know .
they 're not here .
what 's that ?
okay .
stick to my heels .
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences .
i can see the shed from here !
why not ?
because we 're being hunted .
like hell it is !
no ? non-linear equations ? strange attractions ?
i get ah - -
i know , it 's very exciting .
and scary .
and scary .
anti-nature .
dinosaur eats man . woman inherits the earth .
i 'm still not clear on chaos .
it simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems .
it changed . why ?
unpredictability ... .
yeah .
please - - chance it .
must go faster , go , go .
- - shut up .
yes .
hola , bienvenido
i understand that .
grant ?
why not ?
because he 's like me .

dilophosaurus .

you want to put in chain saws ?
just a deer , mister biller .

great .
yeah ?
i think we 're lost .
you have a map .
i really think we should go back ...
who is this ? what 's going on ?
this is janet davenport -- i 'm the realtor .
where 's ken ? is he all right ?
what about that other guy ?
other guy ?
yeah .
he ... he 's here ...
who 's there ?
jas ... jason voorhees ... he 's here ...
and we 're in the center ring .
what ?
his camera ... it 's still recording .
_krueger_ ...
who ?
come on .
your ... client is being booked right now .
what are the charges ?
shit .
compared to this guy ... amateur .
that 's right .
jason 's .
i think it 's our best bet .
it 's all right .
video store ?
wrong .
this is a legitimate cinematic genre .
a seminal film .
he 's fucking nuts .
great .
doesnit sleep ?
insomnia . not unusual for someone in his situation .
he wets the bed ?
i always throw that in .
one of the deputies is pretty cute .
this is jason voorhees .
this sexual obsession of yours .
no need . i 'm self-diagnosed .
so ?
i thought she was a killer , too .
that did n't sound very convincing .
oh ?
you 're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma .
insomnolesence ...
it 's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus .
how do we prove it ?
simple .
then i 'd say it 's bedtime for jason .
cute waitresses ?
that 's open to debate .
i 'll take my chances .
he 's my client , and this is important .
me too . i 'm drunk .
well , i 'm onto something more useful .
fascinating .
that 's right .
do n't you see ? jason was _asleep_ .
yeah ...
yeah , what is it ?
_it 's a second rem pattern_ .
add it to the list .
so what do we do ?
great . when can you do it ?
tomorrow .
you 're not going to be there ?
i was there once ... that was enough .
it was krueger , was n't it ?
a cameraman caught him on videotape .
checking out a theory .
how 's that possible ?
krueger 's the greater danger right now .
then we 're all in a lot of trouble .
_neurolar_ .
about ten minutes .
ten minutes ...
let 's split up .
for the moment !
my client ... is dead .
you have been hearing the sordid side then .
up there .
a glorified office block .
yes -- that 's us .
yes -- we do .
have you worked here long ?
what was the matter with it ?
you were his friend .
i do n't know what you could have read .
just what you 've published .
-- in magazines nobody reads .
i read the one about the penal colony .
did you ?
-- in what sense ?
why do you work in that hideous insurance office ?
no -- not even success .
a man must eat -- and drink .
the < u > castle < /u > cemetery .
in a manner of speaking .
not a chance .
yes .
will you do me a favor then ?
another one ?
what an extraordinary request !
it 's my last and final one .
then its authority is in doubt .
a true friend would do it .
not necessarily .
did you see him ?
i 've never seen him .
your credibility -- yes , it 's well known .
yes .
it 's what i 'm paid to do .
you 're detestable .
and you 're late !
sit down , kafka .
attitude , kafka .
in a small way .
i know .
you 're a friend of eduard raban 's .
why would you suppose so ?
oh -- well , i thought he once mentioned --
one of you must be mistaken .
i 've never seen you here before .
have you looked ?
no .
he would have . you were his best friend .
i suspected that he -- well .
what ?
that he was -- satisfied in that regard .
two or three months , that 's all .
he was n't robbed .
and you believe everything the authorities tell you .
when i have no reason to doubt .
tonight ?
last year . i -- it was broken off .
eduard wanted to marry me .
and you ... ?
i 'm suspicious of men who want to marry .
you wo n't have any trouble finding it .
what of it ?
he was murdered .
my only concern is the human tribunal .
burgel !
why were you given notice ?
they 're not obliged to tell .
i would n't put it past him .
i knew you walked this way to work .
-- i 've just come from the castle .
over ?
this is the result of their elixir of youth .
they 're dead now . we can get help .
i know how they reward failure .
no -- not this time .
i do . always .
yes .
wednesday . we left the office together .
-- accident and compensation association .
where you 've been employed for seven years .
eight -- and seven months .
he was found in the river .
i do n't know .
was he depressed ?
no . he did n't seem to be .
we know that .
what makes you think so ?
... just a perception .
she 's missing .
what did she say ?
we saw her naked once -- did n't we .
you mean you 've actually begun some ?
-- just doing our job .
it 's a farce .
that 's obvious , is n't it ?
-- oh , yes , it 's mad .
then why have n't i been --
a mere slip .
lying in the gutter where they belong .
yes . is n't it there ?
he 's the clerk who died last week .
it 's a factory in the northern mountains .
dr. murnau was the bravest of men .
we 're a medical firm , are n't we ?
i could always apply there .
oskar .
gabriela rossman was here looking for you .
and we 're upset too .
ludwig ?
here too !
they 'd drive us away .
i understand he was wounded in the lung .
it does n't matter .
what 's to become of us now ?
amerika for us !
amerika !

marital problems in general ?
everybody 's got some , i guess .

unless he was involved with grunemann 's disappearance .
i knew tom never wrote that letter .

no sir , we do n't state that .

philip swann ?
you know of him ?
i saw him in vegas once .
are you a gambling man ?
when i can afford to lose .

she has no real grip on reality .
does anybody ?
oh yes .
and what does jennifer think 's real ?
too late . why are you here ?
what ?
you 've taken some strange journeys in your life .
yeah . you could say that .

you ca n't change it .
i 'm not afraid to die .
the puritan ?

you have to tell me who did it .
i 'm gon na go make a stink .
quite a compliment coming from you , doctor .
you know i 'm not comfortable with this .
but your patient is legally entitled to it .
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures .
it 's the patient 's request , doctor .
i think i should join you .
you heard voices , you know you did .
you were n't there .
please , maya .
but bad judgement .
i hope so .
you have a sister in new orleans .
i do n't have the experience .

given all that 's happened , i understand .
something he said , just before ...
he spoke to you ?
yeah . it did n't make any sense .
listen to me , peter .
peter .
do n't you get it ?
so all that bullshit about god and faith .
it was perfect .
everything i did , i did for you .
you are my son .
i had to . there was no other way .
just open the door , please .
do n't worry ... about the transformation , maya .

and i also believe in god and the devil .
i murdered my parents , mr. kelson .
do you remember henry birdson ?
i do .
an exorcism was just held for birdson .
i 'll bet .
on television , you seemed so sure of yourself .
i think you gave me the wrong one .
what do you mean ?
it was blank . nothing on it .
i cranked it all the way up .
you 're right .
and this is evil ?
well , why should i ?
peter , please ...
please , the children .
what ? ! ? !
it 's true .
why did n't birdson just say so ?
trick him .
the good outwitting the bad .
you should think about getting professional help .
you 're already contaminated .
i 'm not going to be drawn into this .
i know this sounds crazy . i understand .
my parents are dead .
there 's no reason why you should .
you were not baptized .
seven years . one baptism ?
yes .
i looked at the coroner 's report .

i do n't know .
what 's the bible for ?
comfort .
i see things . my worst fears .
we 're going to do this .
you have to say that .
that 's true .
i know it is .
maybe that 's my problem .
why did n't you just go along with townsend .
only your body will remain .
what are these ?
i do n't know . extra apartment keys .
maybe i should check lareaux 's book .
sure .
you have to be experienced to do this .
so , what does it mean .
he 's been repeating that since birdson 's exorcism .
not a lot .
it 's me . put the gun down .
whish the circumstances were different .
i know who he is .
maya ? what do you mean ?
i 'll explain everything later .
i 've filed a report with father frank .
a lot of good that 'll do .
we need all the help we can get .
i 've dealt with these people before , maya .

d'artagnan .
i could n't tell you .
anne ... the night we had together ...
may i speak with you ? alone ?
i am preparing for a ball !
we have n't visited in three years .
i wish to discuss your brother .
he is dead ! by god 's choice !
first they told me he had died at birth .
because i have dreamed of him .
yes . dead . two nights ago .
my guards are useless ! take her from me !
he is your brother !
he is nothing now .
wear it until you love it .
next week .
how goes that favor i asked of you ?
i grow closer to my target , your majesty .
do n't look so shocked , phillippe .
phillippe ? ! why do you call me --
shut up , knave !
replace the king .
i am with you !
making the key to the throne .
come , we have a boat waiting .
a body .
i see that is a body !
his plight is obvious , is n't it ?
tomorrow .
tonight ! right now !
those are the words of a broken spirit .
i have it all worked out .
physical resemblance is but one small thing !
those can be adopted --
and people close to him , who --
do you think i have not considered that ?
yes , and he has a choice !
resting , he 's had a long day .
more wine ! !
you must reconsider this plan .
you can do it .
three days ? ? ! !
do n't play god with me , aramis i --
but -- what is porthos doing ?
but -- what is he doing ?
about to hang himself , i should think .
the mask is terrifying ... especially when unexpected .
paris . there is still much to do .
but aramis -- !
he can learn to be phillippe in time .
i offer you the perfect revolution .
we ca n't ... stay here .
you 're a fool !
perhaps . but of d'artagnan i am certain .
perhaps he serves a different king .
to the bastille . and death .
aramis -- the king wishes to see you .
we have grown wiser with age .
i will need you all . all for one .
i know . god go with you .
you ca n't do it .
pull them back !
everyone back .
phillippe , get into the boat .
i trained those men myself .
i just said you 're praying !
really ?
forgiveness ?
jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane .
it is also a place of burial .
a tomb ? we 're in a tomb ?
catacombs . very holy .
i expected action .
i will answer all your questions .
i remember that night .
the child of the king is ... the king .
no , not louis !
athos , do you understand this ?
i carried the king 's child !
well ... well ... okay .
what use am i ?
we go someplace dangerous .
why did n't you say so ?
the queen mother . anne .
bread and wine ... in that cupboard .
who does ?
best not to ask .
at a ball , everyone watches the king !
he lures us to capture .
so what ?
it 's a prison , you idiot !
perhaps this will help .
she died giving you to me .
we were at her door .
she can not possibly refuse .
die ? what ... ?
it is already done .
raoul --
athos , my friend !
life is too long .
they must stay sharp .
i heard your playing .
i was feeling sorry for myself .
she 's a woman , d'artagnan !
i fear i know our king .
what hope is there ?
i know .
oh my friend .
get out of my way .
athos , i beg you --
to kill the king .
the cannons killed raoul !
no man is all bad ... or all good .
i came to see you safely out .
perhaps not as much as you might imagine .
phillippe ... there is something i hope you understand .
what is its antidote ?
no ! do not be sorry !
how did you know -- ?
porthos told me .
your mother 's .
she will be at the ball .
how did you --
d'artagnan ...
just ... water .
a man in black .
phillippe . rest now .
what is it , d'artagnan ?
mademoiselle michelle beaufort .
what quaint notions , d'artagnan !
not criticize -- plead . love .
that is enough !
silence ! i order you !
order fromberge to keep him in safety !
thank you , your majesty .
it ... was nothing .
... tired . must ... lie down .
it shall be done , your majesty .
even the bedchamber passages ! let none remain !
yes , your majesty .
... you knew you had a double ?
he is my brother .
not once have i ever asked anything for myself .
forgive ? !
aramis , porthos and athos too .
they have plotted against me ! me !
there .
sire , we have an emergency -- of security .
... the ball ... continue .
i must insist , sire .
i am unhurt --
no , keeper .
thank you , keeper .
eh ?
what number , on the first page ?
... two-thirty-seven .
what was the end page ?
no .
...
you may go , lieutenant .
not by you .
out directing the search for the traitors .
when he returns , watch him .
shoot them ! shoot them !
what ... an excellent idea , your majesty !
you blush !
how did i get in ?
... nothing .
a letter . may i see ?
enough of this , our dinner waits .
it 's lovely . it 's just ...
this is more than you are used to .
wait , no ! do not be ashamed .
my dear , i 've already done it .

the agents --
you 're the one , neo .
... yes .
go the the adams street bridge .
please . come . sit .
i can see it in your eyes .
yes . thank you .
no .
why not ?
the matrix ?
do you want to know what it is ?
that you are a slave , neo .
be what ? be real ?
far from it .
your muscles have atrophied . we 're rebuilding them .
you 've never used them before .
more important than what is when ?
when ?
wild , is n't it ?
what is real ? how do you define real ?
yes .
for what ?
your training .
show me .
you -- you 're too fast .
because ... i did n't think i would ?
your mind makes it real .
i think i do .
no you do n't .
yeah .
look again .
how ?
what 's going on ?
the beginning ?
of the resistance .
and she knows what ? everything ?
she would say she knows enough .
how does she know ?
she is a true psychic .
and she 's never wrong .
she helped you ?
yes .
what did she tell you ?
that i would find the one .
what do i believe it ?
that 's why we 're here .
why ?
and you still believe i 'm the one ?
yes i do .
yeah ? what about the other five guys ?
no . i did not .
i know .
trinity ! go ! get to the basement .

morpheus . he almost had me convinced .
i know . poor morpheus .
what do you mean , without him ?
how do you know that name ?
i know a lot about you .
my name is trinity .
trinity ? the trinity ?
that was a long time ago .
gee-zus .
what ?
i just thought ... you were a guy .
most guys do .
no .
of what ?
they 're watching you , neo .
who is ?
please . just listen .
what is the matrix ?
it 's necessary , neo . for our protection .
from what ?
from you .
why ?
because you 've been down there , neo .
we think you 're bugged . try to relax .
it 's going into replication .
easy , neo . easy .
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius .
what ?
i used to eat there ... really good noodles .
that 's different .
is it ?
are you worried ?
should i be ?
no .
yes .
what did she tell you ?
she told me ...
... right as rain .
nothing . just had a little deja vu .
what happened ? what did you see ?
it might have been . i 'm not sure .
we ca n't leave him !
we have to !
is morpheus still alive , tank ?
i do n't know . it just went dead .
there has to be something that we can do .
what choice ?
i 'm going in after him .
you ca n't !
i have to .
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out !
i 'm not the one , trinity .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not .
no , neo . that 's not true .
why ?
because ...
i believe i can bring him back .
i 'm coming with you .
no , you 're not .
no ? let me tell you what i believe .
yeah ?

how much time ?
depends on the mind .
neo , this has to be done !
does it ? i do n't know .
what are you talking about ?
the oracle . she told me this would happen .
why ?
because i believe in something .
guns . lots of guns .
duck !
kick it in ! kick it in !
tank , it 's me .
he 's alive .
you 're not far from cypher .
cypher , i thought --
so did we .

i 'll be all right .
dozer ?
you 're going to kill him ? kill morpheus ?
trinity , we do n't have any other choice .
what the hell just happened ?

you 've said it ! aaaaarghhh !
that rabbit 's got a vicious streak .
look . i 'm warning you .
what 's he do ? nibble your bum ?
did i tell you ?
shut up .
i did n't .
bravely ran away , away .
no , no , no .
so , there are rules .
i speak as i find , archie .
not down south you do n't .
i think he nearly ruptured his truss .
seventy a year .
not bad , not bad .
how about yourself ?
sixty .
that 's pretty good for a ghillie .
it 's better than shovelling horse shit .
it 's only grief makes her like she is .
three years , john .
she loved him .
come on , man .
what ?
you know what i mean .
i 'm not sure i do , archie .
the good-looking one .
aye ?
aye , but will they ?
they said you were drunk .
i 'm getting dressed .
you 've got three broken ribs , man !
i 've got my duties to attend to .
do n't be an idiot !
she 'll be worried about me .
she 'll get over it .
i ca n't let her down now , archie .
when are you gon na see it , john ?
aye .
she means it .
it 's a diary .
be careful who sees it .
what do you take me for ?
i 'm all right .
i ca n't move to tidy .
it 's what the maids are for .
she needs me , archie .
mary taylor , sir .
have i seen you up in balmoral , mary ?
i hope to go up next year .
louder , girl !
checked and locked , sir .
kitchen and lower house .
mr brown , sir --
it 's cold out there tonight , barney .
yeah , yeah , i did .
good man . and is she all right ?
yeah .
good . she 's a good girl .
yeah .
are you all right , barney ?
your royal highness .
have you met mr lyle ?
i do n't think i 've had that pleasure .
i take no account of gossip , your highness .
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy .
of course .
i fear the influence he has on her .
i see .
i do n't imagine you frequent the republican clubs .
i 'm flattered you think so .
quite .
i beg your pardon ? mama ... ?
she 's busy .
convey her a message .
she 's away to windsor tomorrow .
whom you address .
the future king !
out of my way !
i thought , a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ?
no dinners , bertie .
it 's so infernally cold in here .
... least of all my son .
yes , but is n't midnight a little excessive ?
it is quite late enough .
and that is my last word on the matter .
not now he does n't .
by whose authority ?
my own .
you 'll talk when i 'm finished !
back and upper corridors .
i 'm sorry ?
how will i know what she requires ?
you 'll be sent a message .
who 'll bring it to me ?
her highness ' equerry .
i need a man who knows where i am .
yes . i do .
i beg your pardon ?
is that the queen 's request ?
yes , it most certainly is !
that can wait till the weekend .
there are important papers from --
it can wait . anything else ?
do n't think i ca n't persuade her .
i am a blank sheet .
do you hunt ?
occasionally .
dare say you can be taught .
to shoot perhaps , but not to kill .
if you hunt , you kill .
quite .
i 've been called back to london .
i do n't think about it .
you 're injured .
it 's nothing .
still , someone must attend you .
i 'm not married .
oh .
this is the top .
i would n't know .
surely --
what i do , i do for my queen .
was there never ambition ?
maybe , once .
then i envy yo .
why ?
for her majesty .
aye .
but yourself ? what about john brown ?
i said . i serve the queen .
no other aspiration ?
ah , but therein lies the paradox .
she trusts you , john .
see what ?
the threat .
too busy looking after themselves .
the greasy pole .
no loyalty .
no love .
in time , she will .
she 'll think i betrayed her .
ma'am .
you are here safely .
aye , ma'am .
you are well ?
i am .
and the pony ?
she 's well , too .
i 'm glad of it .
archie .
yes . that will be company for you .
yes , ma'am .
yes , ma'am .
then why do you persist in doing it ?
because i think her majesty is wrong .
he thought so , yes .
yes .
what ?
those , over there , there .
craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich .
i am told so .
who by ?
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming .
what does he know about the highlands ?
he has been attending at balmoral for many years .
that does n't make him an expert .
just say what you have to say , woman .
to keep out the cold .
aye .
i heard something .
i ordered it .
aye .
yes , ma'am ?
i was told you were in a fight .
yes , ma'am .
has someone seen to those bruises ?
yes , ma'am .
yes ?
the queen forbids it .
then why send me back to them ? !
because i have to !
yes . yes it was .
not at all , dean .
i came as quickly as i could .
oh , several things .
but i lack your prose , mr disraeli .
indeed , and for that they are eternally grateful .
is that not enough ?
no , ma'am .
yes .
the cartoon or her majesty 's absenteeism ?
well , both .
the question is , do we need her ?
surely , you 're not suggesting we dispense --
we 'll see which way the wind blows .
i hope he got his mother 's permission .
to know when he 'll be king .
you ca n't know that for sure .
who ?
mrs brown .
in the press , perhaps .
she 's refusing to leave balmoral .
what 's her excuse this time ?
the princess louisa is too ill to move .
i was trying to imagine `` rather upset . ''
excellent !
no , she was n't .
not too protracted , i hope .
a few days ...
dear oh dear .
we think she can be dissuaded .
yes .
quite .
of course .
some young page was boasting about having seen it .
no , indeed .
whom ?
cold is good !
excellent , ma'am , excellent .
forgive me , your majesty .
the same , your majesty .
yes , ma'am .
what is he doing there ?
he appears to be ... standing by his horse .
i made no request to go out riding today .
i do n't know , ma'am .
mr brown is unable to attend today .
why ?
i believe he is unwell , ma'am .
unwell ?
i understand he was in a fight .
has he been hurt ?
i believe not , ma'am .
a few days , ma'am .
why was i not told earlier ?
i 'm very sorry , ma'am .
of course , at once .
we were expecting you to return by six .
and now i am back .
again ?
read it !
i have no idea .
why not ?
what is it ?
i have a letter , ma'am .
from whom ?
from princess helena and other members of your family .
ma'am .
yes , ma'am .
prince albert is at windsor , ma'am .
why is he not here ?
he is sick , ma'am .
then why are you not with him ?
he has typhoid fever , ma'am .
getting there .
it 's a tough game .
how do you stop the screamer ?
you ca n't .
well ... it involves a paradox .
sure .
yeah , who is n't .
what 's the question mark ?
level ten .
good question .
it 's the game 's logic core .
well , brain-dead anyway . coma patient .
maybe he 's not dead .
he ?
the donor .
and maybe you 've been taking too many drugs .
how 'd you know it was us ?
security camera .
it 's the game , arcade .
you do n't like it ?
why do n't we take this into my office .
there 's something wrong with arcade .
what the hell does that mean ?
he 's probably outside .
everybody 's sick , huh ?
what 's her problem ?
did you play arcade last night ?
actually , no .
yeah ...
so take his car home . wait .
but he was playing the game .
hey , kid .
have you played the game yet ?
listen to me ! greg never came home .
we are talking ...
no , in person . now .
it 's twelve-thirty !
i 'm coming over .
greg never came home .
i 'm in the middle of it ...
turn if off !
no .
it is .
how ? ! it 's a machine , alex .
you imagined it .
quiet . i do have parents , you know .
no it did n't .
call the others . laurie , benz ...
it 's the middle of the night .
all of them ?
it 's two o'clock in the morning .
sure .
no way .
if they 're sick , great .
okay . we 'll see what 's up .
she thought benz was at school .
laurie 's .
it does n't necessarily mean she 's ...
let 's go around back .
what ? !
we ca n't ...
we 'll call 911 . look around alex .
my house . i want to try something .
what ?
it 's not just the cable system .
nick , what is it .
like the fractals ?
... but then it hits the relay stations ...
right .
it 's already out .
the police , then ...
give me a break , alex .
i do n't know .
what ?
they made arcade .
and beat it at it 's own game .
drives 'em crazy every time .
what are you going to do ?
get that helmet .
i ca n't believe you made it !
everything .
dante 's inferno .
yeah . the inferno .
you did n't hear me ?
a way to hook this helmet into the game .
put in a quarter .
it can turn itself on , alex !
yes it does . do n't you see ?
yes i am ...
i know how to do this !
no .
what ?
i do n't want anything to happen to you .
i already have a boyfriend , nick .
i know . it sucks .
we 're actually inside , are n't we ?
one . in case ...
do n't even say it .
yeah , well i figure these are unusual circumstances .
that 's what i was hoping you 'd say .
got it .
you 've got the schematics , check .
right , then ...
yeah , that 's what worries me .
there ...
check your read-out .
what ? ! there 's nothing here !
look around ...
screamer .
we do n't have a choice !
i do n't want to talk about it .
there never is .
never been on a snowboard .
i just thought of something .
so tell me you 're okay , then .
i 'm okay .
good .
sure . never come back . disappear forever .
hold my keys , then .
well , it 's a long story ...
yes ...
thought so .
then we 'll go home .
that way .
in this world , wrong is right !
oh god ... oh god ...
is that your question ?
wait ! no ! that 's not it !
you have no time . what is your question ?
i 'm thinking !
you have no time .
of course i am .
but i do n't understand ...
i miss you so much , alex .
yes ... but ... how did you ...

that 's impossible .

dodge ... he 's not like me at all .
but i 'm not prepared to die .
i 'd like to know why not .
let 's take a look .
okay .
try telling them our names .
you 're our optimist look at the bright side .
so you can talk .
zira does n't want your female .
i want her .
if you insist .
fine . just let her out .
i 'm for that .
relax . you 'll see it all later .
disillusioned ... but vindicated !
all right , all right .
what is it ?
i 'll start by following the shoreline .
i think you 're making a mistake .
that 's the boy . keep 'em flying .
what ?
the flags of discontent .
he would n't leave her .
all right ... get in ... hurry .
keep moving . we ca n't turn back now .
the hunt club .
to scare off humans ?
a man , dr. maximus .
i know it 's a man .
why special ?
we 're -- conducting a new experiment .
my name is taylor .
this hearing is absurd !
bailiff ! make the animal be quiet .
dr. zira ! silence that man !
mind your tongue , madame .
did we create his mind too ?
sustain all objections , but face the truth !
identify him , then . speak to him .
oh , your case was preordained .
no .
emasculation , to begin with . then experimental surgery .
you lied . where is your tribe ?
a fort !
that 's exactly what zira and cornelius claim .
of course .
all right , suppose i am a mutant ?
then you admit --
thank you for calling me taylor .
you 're a menace ! a walking pestilence .
do n't be a fool .
when were the sacred scrolls written ?
twelve hundred years ago .
very well .
okay.up to the cave .
cease fire ! withdraw !
of course , you could return with us .
because you are a man .
the forbidden zone was once a paradise .
do n't look for it , taylor .
shhhh !
what is this ?
a hearing .
which one ?
second from the left .
yes .
actually , you 're a different breed .
maybe not .
you want her that much ?
you threw us together , remember ?
she 's not sick at all .
taylor , please --
he has a point .
it 's humiliating .
was n't i humiliated ? by all of you ?
we ca n't .
it 's better than going to prison for heresy .
god bless you .
of course . he saw you moving yours .
but perhaps he understood --
do you believe him ?
like you , i find it difficult .
where are they now ?
he does n't know .
what ?
he wo n't survive .
in a few minutes there will be no doll .
where ?
i 'll get him .
he 's dead ! where ? ...

yeah , you done said it .
so he got a reduced and come over here .
he dugged his own grave .
bah , you 're a child , lerner .
barnes took a bullet right there .
that 's what he is ... baaaa !
you do n't want to hear about it ?
that 's right .
right ...
this is one time we could sure use elias .
my name 's larry mitchell .
how far does this train go ?
vancouver , b.c .
i 'm going to vancouver , mr. mitchell .
where are you staying in vancouver royal .
is it ?
i 'll make one for you .
well..
a very small service .
i really do n't know .
indefinitely ?
i do n't know .
you do n't know .
very nice mitchell turns .
no thanks ?
thank you .
suppose i had n't known that immigration inspector ?
i 'm supposing .
i think you 're a nice girl .
not tonight .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm sure you have .
nobody gets invited to clark brandon 's parties .
would you mind ?
okay . you win .
how do you do ?
why certainly , baby .
just drunk enough .
how soon can i get a plane to seattle ?
how long would that take ?
possibly , miss .
i 'm miss mayfield . is mr. campbell here ?
i 'm mr. campbell , miss mayfield .
merely for our records , miss mayfield .
no , please .
sit down then .
i see .
disgusting , are n't they ?
i see .
it might be worth a martini to you .
i do n't need it that badly .
it 's open-house . no crashing involved .
what did you say his name was ?
brandon . clark brandon . fellow about my age .
as i said before ...
sure .
and do you amuse the guests ?
no .
you 're drinking it .
i can be talked out of it .
whatever you say .
i did n't say anything .
i hate to be alone .
do you think i do n't ?
thanks for the fresh air . that felt good .
you 're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind ?
no thank you .
what 's funny about that ?
there 's one less tonight .
not with my consent , strange as it seems .
i do n't .
how did you meet him ?
on a train .
he knew the immigration officer .
he was a great boy for that .
that 's all there is .
i 'd rather wait until it does matter .
there was n't any plane .
it 's always a mistake to run away .
no thanks .
you did n't have to tell him that .
bad enough .
he could hardly help suspecting you .
that 's putting it mildly .
quarter after one . why ?
just who are you , anyway ?
you , too ? my name is betty mayfield .
i 'm different . i like it fine .
is this the best you can do ?
at this time of night .
dance ? here ?
why not ?
they know you here -- know your name .
i know everybody .
i did n't notice him .
we walked right passed him .
killaine 's not that sort of guy .
then he 's got to be a detective .
could n't be .
then he 's --
absolutely sure .
we 'll find out .
he 's not a cop .
all right -- following me .
why ?
no matter .
anything i can do about it ?
try not talking .
nothing matters .
no use waiting , then .
so have i .
from you , i like it .
i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store .
you 're probably mistaken about that .
no percentage in that .
they 're going to arrest me .
i know . killaine has a warrant .
i have my own warrant .
yes .
i was tried for murdering my husband . guilty .
they 'll look for you .
i run over to victoria .
and betty mayfield --
blonde , beautiful , and sad -- and nowhere .
but that 's what i 'm doing .
if they had any reason to .
killaine ...
the best interference runner we 've got .
this must have cost a fortune .
do you have to leave the note ?
it 's the frame on the picture .
you leave it .
killaine 's wise to what ?
i can still see the shoreline .
there would be a moon tonight .
frozen .
if you 're doing all this just for me .
that , and the fun of it .
that 's right .
including killaine .
larry mitchell found out . so you killed him .
what your father did does n't condemn you .
nobody believed i was n't in on it .
no . i paid him off .
you-killed-him ?
magruder obliged me .
do n't go soft on me , baby .
i 'm still on course to victoria .
yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody .
and that nasty man that followed us last night .
who 'd believe it but you ?
you think magruder wants to hang beside me ?
but the next one is murder .
would i want to ?
every day of your life you 'll want me .
shut up ! cut it out !
me ?
yes . you .
do you think i was faking ?
if i did-i don't-now .
i 'd like a dry martini .
sorry , miss . beer and ale only .
beer ? well , all right .
beer or ale , miss ?
ale . i do n't mind .
right , miss .
i do n't know her.. or particularly want to .
you probably know the type .
i was born in new york city .
you did n't ask a question .
that 's an evasion and you know it .
it is ?
who told you i was married ?
regimental ! seaforth highlanders .
i 'm sorry .
stop saying you 're sorry .
yes .
where 's you get it ?
a graduation present .
you must come from pretty far south .
i 've never been to florida .
true . i was a bit irritable last night .
who has n't -- one way or another ?
we 're 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered .
you were there when i last saw him .
i 'd like to believe that .
the police always do , do n't they ?
you -- or the vancouver police department ?
we try to be decent .
you 're a police officer .
if i understand what you meant by that .
you understand perfectly .
i do n't want to talk .
i 've come here to arrest you for murder .
i might be able to save you .
very ridiculous .
jeff .
looking for peanuts , i suppose .
so mitchell had handled it .
i always wear gloves when i shoot people .
time 's up . i 'm off the case .
because you think your in love with me ?
to do what ?
i ca n't answer that .
what will they do to you ?
that 's they 're business .
you 're still a police officer , jeff .
i 've been a soldier too .
i know that .
but even if you were in love with me .
there 's an empty taxi across the street .
not sometimes . always .
goodbye , betty .
we know everything .
no , jeff . you do n't .
i hope he can prove it . come on .
morning . any calls ?
mr. reed would like you to call him .
all right . get him .
and there 's a mr. goble to see you .
who 's goble ?
this way .
i 'm still asking . what do you want ?
i 'm not sure i want anything from you .
name it .
you guessed it . the card 's phony .
what are your rates ?
$ 40 a day and expenses .
what have you got on miss mayfield ?
mayfield ?
for five hundred , what do i get ?
i go home and paint the kitchen .
for two hundred ?
i stick around and wait for the five hundred .
you mentioned information .
sorry . another client paid for that .
a thousand .
got it on you ?
got the information on you ?
get it in half an hour .
i do n't like your perfume in my office .
in the same elevator .
fascinated .
martini .
you , killaine ?
and without much discrimination .
leave that one lay .
that comedian ?
what 's a buzzer ?
so you 're not a cop .
me a cop ?
who told you my name ?
i 've got good ears .
the new ones are fine .
i do n't like to be tailed .
a private joke .
how 's life treating you ?
the usual grind .
round of golf saturday ?
if i can get off .
somebody mitchell picked up on the train .
yes , i 've seen it before .
quite sure you had no motive ?
i rather thought so .
near his right hand . about a foot away .
no thanks . i had some .
delightfully .
i do n't .
well -- good night .
if it does n't take too long . drink ?
thanks . i do n't mind .
i never notice the view after the first week .
i would .
i would n't know .
could we discuss that some other time ?
sure . let 's discuss betty mayfield .
a couple of hours .
i have a warrant for her arrest .
that must hurt .
would that make me a heel ?
you 'd be breaking the law .
does n't answer the question .
the only answer i have for you .
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her .
information .
do n't kid me .
it could have been an accident .
that could be told .
not if she knew she would n't be believed .
your concentrating too hard , killaine .
mitchell was killed down here .
how could mitchell ?
or just drunk enough .
you do n't buy it . okay .
no idea .
where would she go , anyway .
i 'm afraid they do . far too often .
wait a minute . i 'll go with you .
i tried it once . i lost my shirt .
i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .
where did it all come from ?
what ?
you asked me where it all came from .
oh .
the liquors lovely .
lay off , ca n't you ?
lay off what ?
did i do something wrong ?
i would n't know .
how would you know , brandon ?
want to walk out ... or get thrown out ?
you do n't throw guests out , brandon .
do n't bet on it . i 'm eccentric .
mr. mitchell .
a little something on account perhaps ?
rather more than a little something , mr. mitchell .
i 'm afraid this is all for the moment .
i do n't think you locked your door .
what do you want ?
see how easy it is ?
passkey ?
do n't be a fool . i loved him .
sardonic , if you will my dear .
that 's not enough .
he saw my face too .
they 'll arrest that girl .
convenient , is n't it ?
with what motive ?
nastiness . you 're nasty with words .
he was very easy to hate .
no , not recently .
thank you .
not a floater . only just dead .
you 're the waterfront specialist .
you have two murders to investigate .
drunk-rolling job . they hit him too hard .
let me know when you 've identified him
i 'm an irishman , sir .
i 've got a year . or a second .
you told me when we 'd identified this fellow --
swimming with his hat on ? that 's original .
i 'd suggest a telegram .
would you ?
if you 're asking my opinion , no .
magruder 's conked out .
the joint 's not open , mac .
one of those nice long manila envelopes -- sealed .
what do i get for it ?
you get it 's brother .
sounds like a fair swap .
open it and count it .
when you sign for it , you count it .
so it seems sergeant .
right .
i 've met her .
it 's her room .
unless the gun was slanted up .
i 'll know when i find it .
i guess i 'm just ballast around here .
gigi , huh ?
maybe we 've been pretty dumb --
i think so .
where 's the shell ?
should be over there .
assume there is something to hid .
do i know who lives down there ?
you can find out .
you can find out the first part .
you 've got a dead man on your hands .
well . what about it ?
i 've handled it . mitchell 's handed it .
so ?
he could have tried .
did we ever really think it was suicide ?
you win , inspector .
and a motive -- which we have n't got .
a think wire -- -but very , very strong .
i never wear a hat .
oh nothing .
are you always this witty ?
warm water , no doubt .
positive ?
not quiet yet .
i shall .
i am a fool .
that depends upon your motive .
you did n't play it for laughs last night .
did you ever have a serious operation ?
mortar shells are not funny , either .
at first , it does n't hurt at all .
not if it clears the air .
it does . may i go now ?
i 'll investigate mr. clarendon 's financial position --
i do n't understand .
sure .
i 'm interested in who handled it .
four different people , inspector .
how about magruder ?
he checks too .
that leaves two strangers .
so far .
try betty mayfield . the mitchell case .
mayfield ? she fit into this ?
she might .
the card says so , does n't it ?
brandon handled the money envelope .
how do you do , sir .
she 's a suspect , naturally .
i hear she 's a very pretty girl .
i do n't know , sir .
well , find out . who 's covering her ?
i disagree , sir .
identification on possible , sir . not conclusive .
`` superintendent j. mckechnie , vancouver police department .
but you still think she 's innocent .
i do .
two .
nor i .
you 're a young man . you 're romantic .
not too far , i hope .
what are my orders , sir ?
so-so .
who 's the girl ?
her name 's mayfield . betty mayfield .
nice .
why should i mind ?
you should n't .
as thoroughly as i could .
margo , darling . you washed me up .
she 's very beautiful .
rich ? i have n't the faintest idea .
you ought to know why .
i do n't .
splendid . now she can return the compliment .
you 'd go to jail .
correct .
she is much younger than i am .
i seem to recognize this routine .
kind or not kind . what 's the difference ?
what does it look like ?
how long have you had it ?
years , why ?
you already have the checks , darling .
of course .
how about your new friend ?
i told you she 's just..
a girl you meet on the train .
right .
in an hour , larry .
it 's quite unimportant , mr. mitchell .
be nasty .
i say yes !
unsophisticated ? if i knew about this babe ...
it 's kind of you to see me .
he was delightful .
i see .
yes .
good . suez was a minefield for both parties .
to james .
thanks .
i think you 'll do very well .
actually , we 've only just met .
she 'll be here next weekend .
do n't be silly .
we 'll see you next week , and if --
i will , thanks .
well , we were just ...
yes .
what went wrong ?
oh , many things .
sit on that log , dear .
penfield . james penfield .
that does n't matter .
but what we need is national coverage .
not too bad , thanks .
i 'm not sure i can face it .
keep me company .
she 's fine .
no . that 's terrible , charles .
exactly that .
i see .
of course .
why , is there a new foreign secretary ?
it need n't concern you , edward .
a glamorous young lady way above his station ...
hello .
i wo n't introduce you all by name .
i 'll have some of that .
... break away completely from --
and some of that . sorry .
no . i 'd want to --
good .
are you going to have coffee ?
yes , please .
and you 'll join me in a sambucca ?
thank you .
you know the lingo . jolly good .
thank you .
it 's everything we wanted .
and to history .
that 's her .
thank you .
yes , that 's right .
no , it 's all right .
i quite liked it .
i thought it was tremendous .
i think it went on rather too long .
i could n't bear for it to end .
and i did n't like that man .
oh , but he was terrific .
and the shape of it all .
really ?
too bad . what did your father do ?
my real father ?
and you 're at this third stage
no , there 's a fourth . numbness .
yes .
it makes me weepy just to remember it .
both dead .
that must be rather nice , in a way .
who ?
i called you a taxi .
very thoughtful .
well , you know ...
yes , if you like .
i have to be up early .
me too .
two or three years ago i would have stayed .
too late . just my luck .
i do n't trust anyone .
in radio we 're different .
i bet . thanks for the drink .
you just might .
i think she liked me .
did she talk about me ?
no .
well , you should .
no . it 's a bit of a madhouse .
might ?
yes . might .
what did he want ?
he 's making plans for brighton .
that 'll be fun
in your car
why not .
oh ... excuse me . there 's nicholas .
to the airlift .
to the airlift .
any sign of the goddess barrington ?
not yet you know any of these people ?
one or two . a grey lot .
we were just chortling over that .
no jokes . james is in love .
name so susie barrington .
to the fleet .
and the argies .
the argies .
come on . hand over .
it 's shit .
you approve !
let me see .
get way .
oh yes .
ah , ah . there 's more .
it 's obvious what you have to do .
she 's very nice , apparently .
ha ha ...
we 've been playing ten minutes for christ sake .
far too long .
sorry . got held up .
delivering gossip and goodwill .
will it be fun ?
i 'm off . let 's meet .
i 'll ring you .
i 'm not sure .
yes , finally .
big mistake , i think .
are you up to something ?
fuck off .
and you were obviously getting nowhere with her .
it might have worked . really .
you 're a piece of shit
i 've known susan for more than fifteen years .
hello .
i 'm waiting for your mother .
thanks .
why not sit down and wait ?
okay , i will .

i do n't know .
and i do n't believe you ...
so where do you go from here ?
i do n't know .
and who are you ?
the deal ?
how do we know that ?
that 's why you were riding with him .
some places , not all .
what is ?
budweiser ?
not to me , you know that .
i thought i did .
they 're part of the team .
that 's him .
you lose them !
not yet ...
they 're good !
no , seamus .
you were a soldier , were you ?
once .
i did n't think to see you again tonight .
i still am .
is that right ?
that 's right .
duty calls ?
just business .
i do n't know ... well i do n't !
i 'm a patriate .
do n't even think that i 'm buying that .
where do you get off saying word one ?
bloody fucking hell ...
alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !
not likely .
good , because it cost enough .
i 'd stake my reputation .
ready when you are ...
there 's a problem ...
do n't do it , sam !
shut up !
really ? do you have the money with you ?
do you have the material ?
you first , edvard .
perhaps we could both go at the same time ...
i think not . after you ...
not so fast . who 's that ?
he 's company .
bad company ...
what do you mean ?
there 's been a slight problem .
what 's that ?
of course .
in here ...
no , mikhi , i would n't .
i 'll destroy whatever 's in the case .
you 'll die if you leave here .
what 's a little hate between business partners ?
i got this gig through a contractor .
bullshit !
i swear ...
then where is it ?
i sent it to myself in paris .
sent it where ?
a post office box .
it 's done .
much to your disappointment , no doubt .
what i do is none of your concern .
that 's it .
then i guess we 're set .
there is one other thing ...
what 's that ?
do n't cross me ...
nobody 's going to do that !
really ?
hello , my friend .
yes , sam 's tough alright .
and you respect him .
of course . do n't you ?
not exactly .
not exactly ? but close enough , eh ?
how did you know ?
you should really let a doctor look at that .
soon .
but first you have something to take care of ?
yeah .
something important ? a thing that can not wait ?
it gets done now or not at all .
i did n't expect that he would .
not a word .
call it a reckoning of character .
perhaps forged is a better word . like steel .
you seem one to me .
gets the job done .
all in the stomach , though .
not for long .
long enough to shoot back .
is that right ?
it 's been known to happen .
why do n't you go do better , then ...
my way is better .
what a surprise ...
i got a surprise for you , blondie ...
who 's they ?
everybody .
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?
i 'm just worried about your health , larry .
eat shit and die slowly ...
you should learn a little patience .
is that right ?
i know cops -- and you 're no cop .
no thanks .
let 's just say he knows who i am .
coordinate what ?
things . this is my country , you know .
to see a man about a thing .
i can do that .
that 's what i thought .
as in , they own it ?
something like that ...
i do n't .
i asked if we could give him anything else .
jujitsu .
same thing , is n't it ?
not at all .
what 's the difference ?
one 's a lot more painful than the other .
i do .
it has it 's moments .
like larry or swede .
exactly . why not bring them ?
so is the woman .
deirdre ?
i wonder if she truly left the ira .
i 've wondered that myself .
who am i ?
they certainly are .
i just wanted to see something .
see what ?
well i ai n't a cop .
know what ?
that there was a gun pointed at me .
you were smoking ?
please , help yourself .
a lot of people died .
i 've seen a lot of people die before .
i have n't . not like that .
you do n't .

i never made that claim .
i know . jean-pierre did .
you were behind the door ?
i was waiting to see what would happen .
i would have tried not to .
because i owe you . look at that ...

you said it yourself : gregor 's not dead .
i do n't know ...
you do n't know ?
right now ?

why are you driving ?
business keeps you on the road ?
something like that .
no you do n't , and you know it .
i think not .
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
just like that ?
would you stop with that ...
why ?
why not ?
that 's a good question .
do you have a good answer ?
no , i do n't .
i 'll work on it ...
finish the job ...
and now ...
finish it !
what ?
you speak french .
what of it ?
nothing ...
i know .
you better get some sleep , alright ?

i guess that 's for the best .
it 's an international thing .

why did n't you kill him ?
you put everything on the line because you ...
you slept with the fucker ! !
i 'm alright . and you ?

that 's what everyone thinks .
they 're out of towners ... arizona plates ...
there must be over a million dollars in here .

i do n't know .
what 's that ?
what are you gon na do ?
well , i do n't know .
he saw everything !

that 's not what i mean .
listen . do you want to go to jail ?
i do n't know ...
this is n't a joke .

it 's the right thing to do .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass .
what are you thinking ?
i do n't know ...
i ca n't do that .
okay then . i 'll do it .
listen . do you want to go to jail ?
he would have done it to us , right ?
exactly . this is our little secret , partner .
well i 'm not !
well does n't he ?
i 've got a better idea .
and how do you figure we do that ?
he 's probably made copies .
well i mean it this time . come on .
no .
neither do i .
how badly do you want that money ? !
who said anything about killing ?
i do n't know !
i 'm just making our intentions clear .

it 's gon na be o.k .
like hell it is . this is jesse !
come on . booth grabs the bag --

just some asshole trying to scare me .
i 'll go . i do n't mind .
can we talk ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
look , yesterday was n't my idea .
what do you want from me , cotton ?
you could start with an apology .
i did that .
you wrote me a letter . very cordial .
how ?
it helped me realize one thing .
what ?
you 're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother .
please , cotton , dont do this .
its over , cotton .
not until youre dead .
did you do it ?
cotton , i 've done nothing but help you .
job hazard . debbie salt , stringer -- newsweek .
fair enough .
what are you doing here ?
do i know you ? you look familiar .
tons and tons .
where is sidney 's father ?
home -- where he lives .
and are the police sure about that ?
why do n't you ask them ?
already did .
parents are always responsible .
youre all in this together ?
where do you think he got it ?
finish what my son started .
but youll never get away with it .
enter cotton weary .
hey , it 's cool .
what 's your subject ?
i was a sorority slut .
should we be worried about this guy ?
definitely whitney .
where 's sid ?
she dumped me .
no way .
yeah .
you freakin ?
i skipped .
i 'm sorry , baby .
do n't ask what you can do .
sid , you do n't have to .
i 'm sorry honey . i got behind .
the forbidden subject .
i 'll get my jacket .
i think it 's out of your control .
what about your film ?
it 's under control .
no , it 's not .
it 's not you , derek .
no . this is a set up .
thats quick .
good question . you took the bait .
so you 'll relieve me at 2:30 ...
damned if i know . she ditched me .
you were n't supposed to leave her alone .
i did n't say she was alone .
what guy ?
randy somebody .
are n't most serial killers seemingly harmless ?
i got it..
yeah , how can we help ?
he hates oliver stone .
i find his work overwrought .
we have our own website now .
youre the one who got away .
until now .
the way i see it . well be arrested .
were hoping for the death penalty .
hope youre ready , sid .
so we found a compromise .
or it found us .
wait a sec , derek .
tails .
tuitions expensive .
miss weathers .
yes , i do retain reading skills . shock .
oh dewey , i 'm sorry .

you 're a hard one to figure out .
i think you 're all an act .
and deep down i 'm a good person ?
yeah ?
not good .
solid alibis .
billy had alibis too .
what are we looking for ?
a bloody knife . a ghost mask .
can we turn the light on ?
that 's not the way it 's done .
dewey , you and i would never make it .
maybe not . but think about the sex .
..and as lonely as i am ...
we 'd break some furniture .
and joel 's pre-med .
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .

hallie ?
let 's find out .
over here .

they do n't know . it was carefully planned .
yeah , right .
no . i will not crawl under a rock .
no . this is nothing , dewey .
dewey , there 's no such place .
humor me , sid .
whatever .
i 'll give you one guess .
that 's not the way we play the game .
i do n't play games .

i owe you shit .
do you still think he 's innocent ?
i think you falsely identified him . yes .
have you talked to cotton ?
many times .
has his story changed ?
not one word .
he was drunk that night .
why would she lie about it ?
for attention . the girl has some serious issues .
and why would she do that ?
maybe she 's a slut just like her mom .
please , it 's common knowledge .
and it fucked her up royally .
ricki lake .
scary night , is n't it ?
do you like scary movies , sidney ?
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
do n't start .
and why is that ?
because they 're all the same .
that is so unoriginal .
maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .
so who are you ?
the question is not who am i .
so where are you ?
your front porch .
that 's the original part .
right here .
uh-huh .
what am i doing ?
hello sidney .
looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .
who are you ?
can you knock ?
i heard screaming .
no you did n't .
no ? oh , well ...
... so call if you need me .
got it .
sleep tight , sweetie .
oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced .
fuck you , nut case .
working , thank you .
i thought blockbuster fired you .
twice .
do n't shoot . it 's me .
do n't come any closer .
listen to me , sid . i found tatum .
you got it .
before she dumped him for steve .
what are you saying ?
it would certainly improve your high school q .
we had a run in the mass murder section .
you coming tonight ?
what ?
you 're such a little lap dog .
the why 'd the police let him go ?
because , obviously they do n't watch enough movies .
maybe sidney would n't have sex with him .
she 's saving herself for you .
could be .
because he 's probably dead .
it 's 1995 -- motives are incidental .
i had 'em hid in the foreign section .
he came to make up .
there goes my chance with sid .
like you had one .
not until trading places in '83 .
yeah .
i 'll be right back .
do n't listen to him . it 's him .
no , sid .
hey , stu ?
are you kidding ? this is like christmas .
are you serious ?
my parents are out of town .
yeah , okay ... whatever .
cool . see you guys tonight . bring food .
you guys can go up to my parents room ?
why are you doing this ?
it 's all part of the game .
the official term is `` psychotic '' .
you 'll never get away with this .
peer pressure ... i 'm way to sensitive .
what happened ?
no way .
and not just killed , sid .
not anymore .
do they know who did it ?
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school .
they think it 's school-related ?
they do n't know .
how do you gut someone ?
no prob .
tell your mom i said thanks .
yeah , yeah ... are you okay ?
thanks , tatum .
later .
it 's past seven .
do n't worry .
bye .
her dad 's out of town .
just like old times , ai n't it ?
no , nothing 's like it used to be .
he was there , tatum .
i knew this guy was too perfect .
it 's alright . i 'll get it .
just a sec ...
i bet he 's pissed .
just ignore him .
it was him , tatum . i know it .
i do n't know ...
come on . pathos has it 's perks .
so you think my mom was a slut too ?
i did n't say that , sid .
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers .
it goes further back , sid .
and you believe it ?
come on , let 's rock .
oh , god ...
he better not be .
grant wrote the song himself .
watch the show , sid .
oh , sidney . what ?
i do n't know , they just did .
i did . he 's full of shit .
for once , stu , drop it .
where you guys been ?
tits -- see .
what am i ? the beer wench ?
hey , guess who 's here ?
give it to me .
how 's that ?
thank you .
go start picking up the pieces .
he would n't just turn himself in .
ease back , mills .
i 'm in .
announcing what ?
there are seven deadly sins .
so what ? this victim ...
... envy , sloth , pride and lust .
one is gluttony .
this ca n't be my last duty here .
i know what you 're thinking , okay ?
no , i have n't heard .
there was a second .
greed . it was written in blood .
i thought you might want to be filled in .
i 'm sure everyone 's doing their best .
yeah .
good .
ca n't you feel it yet ?
what are you talking about ?
you know .
i heard .
i have no understanding of this place anymore .
it 's always been like this .
really ?
he 's not finished .
i read about it in the paper .
i 'll see you .
what ? what ?
where was the prostitute ? where was she ?
who tied her down ? you or him ?
he had a gun .
turn around . hands on your head !
what the hell 's going on ?
who are you ?
i 'm ... i 'm just delivering a package .
put it down . put it on the ground .
okay ...
hello .
it 's not too far away now .
why ?
her pretty head .
no !
you 'll see .
it 's going to be flawless .
oh , do n't worry . you wo n't ...
you would n't because you know there are consequences .
innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ?
a woman ...
murderers like you ?
you should be thanking me .
and , why is that ?
really ? just biding your time , then ?
and , i remember breaking your nose .
it 's close .
what the fuck is going on here ? !
shut up !
what the fuck is going on ?
because i envy your normal life .
i ... i do n't follow .
maybe i 'm not understanding the question .
it 's very simple .
i realize that .
for now .
no one yet .
then , why are we wasting our time ?
what ?
there 's a bucket . under the table .
is there any blood in it ?
i do n't know .
guessing at this point is useless .
no .
anyway ...
good .
okay ... sure ...
this was one sadistic motherfucker .
whoa , whoa ... what ? !
can we talk about this in private ?
detective mills here . honey ...
what ?
how 's that ?
tonight .
hello .
what about them ?
i read . remember reading ?
i 'm certain .
all day saturday , and all day sunday .
and , if it 's a threat .
we put her in a safe house .
punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons .
did you read them ?
yeah . parts of them .
right .
forced what ?
attrition .
nothing .
totally unrelated victims .
none . which i do n't understand .
i know .
it 's got to be .
a switchblade .
we 're screwed . he 's fucking with us .
bear with me .
just wait !
it does n't fit .
who the hell knows ?
i wish i still thought like you .
does n't seem like our man , does it ?
you tell me . i 'm new in town .
he does n't have the desire somehow .
the fingerprints .
yes .
we 'll tag along .
satisfy our curiosity ?
never took a bullet .
and ?
it was my first one of these .
i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch .
i expected it to be bad , you know .
i think hemingway wrote somewhere ...
call an ambulance .
listen to me .
no kidding ! no fucking kidding !
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here .
oh , it 's alright .
oh , blah , blah , blah .
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .
we do n't know for sure ...
yes we do . here ...
i do n't know ... like fifty .
let 's go .
for a long time , the f.b.i .
they monitor reading habits .
you got to be kidding .
legal ... illegal . these terms do n't apply .
yeah .
how do you know all about this ?
i do n't . neither do you .
we 're focusing .
it 's not what you think it is .
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism .
that is .
the writings of saint thomas aqu ... aquin ...
saint thomas aquinas .
that 's what it says . jonathan doe .
this is stupid .
we 'll take a look at him .
sure .
you do the talking .
who told you about my silver tongue ?
i 'm fine .
what happened ?
it was him .
you ca n't go in there .
we need a warrant .

i am not so well-born .
all the men at court are without poetry .

it is not my fault , master shakespeare .
sam !
`` parting is such sweet sorrow ''
`` she speaks .

i was in a play .
oh . what is your name ?

the same , alas .
oh but why `` alas ? ''
a lowly player .
if they find you here they will kill you .
you can bring them with a word .
oh , not for the world !
can you love a player ?
then kiss me again for i am not mistook .
it is strange to me , too .
there is .
even your play .

your father should keep you better informed .
i do not love you , my lord .
how your mind hops about !
virginia ? !
why , yes !
but why me ?
it was your eyes . no , your lips .
the queen has consented ?
she wants to inspect you .
i will do my duty , my lord .
ah ! my lady !
it is not my riding day , my lord .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
i am going to church .
i understand of course .

oh thomas , a pair of pippins !
by coveting my property .
christopher marlowe at your service .

her chaperone . my lady 's country cousin .
on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
a man , my lord ?
by god , i 'll fight the lot of you
i do n't know -- campbell or something ?

it 's true .
alex , i do n't have the time --

nothing .
you 're not eating .
not eating what ?
secure it ?
looking for you ? yes .
what for ? what did you want ?
we just wanted to speak to you .
your friends .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
i beg your pardon ?
they know ? so what ?
yeah , i was phoning your mother .
you old devil .
oh , no , no , no .
for the best . exactly .
but more laughter than tears , i think ?
where will we go ? where will we go ?
i bought the tickets .
your idea ? well , that fits .
i do n't know anything about it .
of course you do n't know anything about it .
well ?
but there 's no --
animals involved ?
i do n't know .
do n't know what ?
this is just an informal discussion .
are you recording it ?
what does it look like ?
it looks like he 's writing everything down .
that 's because he is .
no . why should it ?
well , then ?
i 've never seen any of these men before .
take another look at these two .
i do n't know them .

-- which is a hack .
the man we know and love .
yeah .
i think you 're lying .
you 're right .
you see , they do n't really know me .

what sort of car ?
alex , how shouldi know ?

no , no , it 's different .
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff .
it tastes different .
i do n't want it to taste different .
he 's right .
you know we 're right .
do n't you ?
because that 's no good .
he ca n't stay up there .
he 'll come down . leave him alone .
what are you doing here ?
we have to talk .
your painful groin ?
david ?
exactly . now i 've been thinking --
oh , good .
he is n't safe up there .
we could put it somewhere .
where he ca n't get it ?
now you thought of that , not me .
forget it -- he 'll come down .
no .
oh .
well , i 'm not expecting anyone either .
it 's the only way .
i refuse .
you 're frightened .
no , i 'm not frightened .
i 'll wait there .
everything .
alex .
what ?
yes , of course .
we were just sorting things out .
that 's what i thought he said .
the perfect couple , i should say .
you must n't take it so badly .
do n't worry about it .
no .
let him go . let him take it all .
i see .
yeah , well , that 's what she said .

he did n't do you a favor .
screw you !
then-you run .
you 'd lose . you 'd die .
all right ! i get the picture !
get a stenographer .
maybe hawaii .
no nothing .
safest place in the world .
it 's a convent .
but vince has contacts all over the place !
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent .
i ca n't stay here !
pray .
calm down .
keeping our witnesses alive .
but it 's a nightmare !
you blew it -- big time .
what if i was vince ?
it was n't my fault !
you 're supposed to be hiding out !
i really ca n't talk about it now .
listen to yourself .
i know that . this is n't about me .
jesus , look at you you 're glowing .
i am ?
yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..
really ? lieutenant ?
i 've been worried about you .
no -- worried about you . personally .
you 're not ... seeing anybody ?
no .
i have ?
you re sort of ... radiant .
just remember - you 're a target .
i know , i know .
how ?
long story .
what ?
i think they 'd understand .
that 's not the point ! they need me !
you do n't get it !
nuns ?
even nuns have to pee .
that depends .
yeah , like what ?
hail , mary .
jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .
oh-huh .
people throw stones . they call me names .
really .
but -- wait .
a hiding place .
they open a window .
vince is getting desperate .
where 's who ?
you wo n't even tell us ?
i would n't even tell the pope .
we 're the guys from vegas .
we did n't tell you what ?
that she 's a nun !
i 'm telling you !
maybe .
take care of it .
it 's a bluff , vince .
you know so much .
not ... totally .
what 's the problem ?
it did n't work , vince .
so , take it off .
which one !
which one ?
willy -- hit the lights .
where is she ?
yeah , right -- when i see it .
forget her ! we got the one we need !
neither did you !
for like , twelve zillion eternities ?
and then we can ice her .
she 's praying .
dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30 .
we 're losing it .
that should have tipped us .
we ca n't leave it up to the feds !
yes ?
i need to see you , at once .
really ...
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
all right . it 's a beginning .
however , we can also pray for other things .
measles .
which convent was that , sister ?
really , mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
that was exciting !
he 's decent .
he 's kind .
it 's better than ice cream .
it 's better than springtime .
mary clarence -- you should n't have .
it 's no use .
we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there .
yes -- two men -- and they had guns .
she was n't a nun ?
she 's our inspiration !
and what a lovely name . las vegas ...
but how do we get there ?
a benedictine .
christy .
impossible .
but ... she was a showgirl .
but where ?
yes ?
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
we 're a small convent , bishop .
st. katherine 's is a benedictine order .
i lied .
i know .
she did . bring her back . now .
can you hold ? can you try ?
i love you , chris . i always will .
she 's acting weird , vince .
are you nuts ? she 's not a nun .
find 'em !
must have been the redman .
well enough .

protest to my superiors if you like .
your superiors are two days away !
it is only important what you are .
i am the lord 's voice in this town .
wallowing in sin and lust ...
they need guidance .

which may explain his temperament .
extra ordinary , yes .

then , i also have a gift for you .
i insist that you have it .
very well .
that would be a pity .
they have done nothing of the sort .
wo n't they still have that justice ?
no stone may be left unturned .
i have misjudged you i think .
you are not regarding it in full .
must i hear this ?
there was no blind stabbing .
it was not butchery .

the material world is an illusion .
i 'm not `` people . ''
thanks , but i 'll manage .
suit yourself .
same here .
i listen on the radio .
nice drawing . did you do that ?
my father did .
it 's strange , though , is n't it ?
is your father an artist ?
no , he was a schoolteacher .
he 's dead ?
twelve , thirteen years ago .
is that what you do ? draw pictures ?
yeah , sometimes .
what time is it ?
eight-thirty .
eight-thirty ?
i 'm sorry .
i did n't ask to come here .
three nights .
are you going to be all right ?
absolutely . the world is my oyster .
do you need some money ? some extra clothes ?
not a penny , not a stitch .
take good care of yourself , okay ?
you too .
i do n't know . for helping me out .
where did you get that thing ?
i bought it .
business appointment .
cut it out , will you ?
i do n't have much time .
close the door . sit down in that chair .
you do n't really want to know .
i do n't , huh ?
i crossed paths with him .
you 're joking , right ?
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere .
maybe .
fair enough .
what time did you get to bed last night ?
i do n't know . two or three .
you work too hard , you know that ?
just so you do n't overdo it .
okay , just a little hint .
yeah , right . the inspiration .
all right . listen carefully .
no , not the end . the beginning .
it 's my birthday .
i just did .
i mean earlier . we could have planned something .
pick two or three .
absolutely . we would be honored .
his only copy .
you do n't believe me , huh ?
is it yours ?
yeah , it might be .
here , catch .
and started to run .
and started to run .
good thinking .
that 's just it . i did n't think .
six thousand dollars .
it was more complicated than that .
well ?
it was n't my fault .
the water was dripping , see ...
no wonder he was angry .
i 'm serious , all right .
you 'll do it , all right .
i pay auggie , and i 've got nothing .
do n't worry about it .
good . i 'm glad that 's settled !
wow . they sure did a job on you .
research .
it 's all right .
now ask him who his mother was .
if you 're lucky .
medium rare , please .
fries ?
yes , please .
lettuce and tomato ?
yes , please .
you want another one of these , too ?
what are you sellin ' 'em for ?
oh , yeh ?
hid it from my mom .
did n't say i was buyin ' did i ?
carl heine 's type .
that 's obvious .
you do n't .
... or from the cut on his hand .
why ? if they could never take title .
their kids was born here .
in the war . europe , i believe .
well .
second question .
a thousand .
it is .
you done your math right .
unwritten rule of the sea .
i 'm sorry about that .
could n't get on the boat .
compressed air horn , most likely .
your husband returned at , what , seven o'clock ?
closer to eight .
so , five hours .
of course not .
and then , something did .
up in the air ?
why not ?
we were afraid . silence seemed better .
well , it seems to me ...
you 're implying th ...
i said . no further questions .
easy . slow is best .
your friends would .
we 're japanese , not mexican , ishmael .
why ? we 're only talking .
it 'll be over soon .
look at my face .
i do n't mean everyone .
i 'm sorry about your arm .
the japs did it .
i did . but the jury wo n't s ...
it 's not for the .
agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma .
those are n't the facts that matter .
... but he found you .
more than eager .
what else ?
and the next one ... ?
from carl heine 's boat .
and the last ... ?
found on carl 's boat , too .
you bet .
pretty darn clear .
and why . is that ?
could you tell me what 'kendo ' is ?
japanese stick-fighting .
objection ! speculation .
he did n't want to lose any more .
that 's curious .
oh , yeh .
carl heine came .
actually , she said you had decided .
should have told 'everything ' .
i have told the truth .
you mean , this morning .
yes .
since september . last guys got transferred .
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16 .
some seaman 's loast report .
three kids . what 's she going to do ?
wo n't take two .
you 're right . i better use two .
do n't prove there was two lanterns .
you 're wondering why i held it .
yes , he was .
to my father . everything counts .
well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong .
fell .
just as the freighter comes through ?
coincidences happen .
maybe ... ?
the knife . what knife ?
the freighter started through at 1:42 .
he hit his head . on the way in .
well , anything coulda caused that .
i 'll take two . one for later .
it 's a rare thing .
we have a warrant . to search your boat .
i was checking the cables .
naw , i had that around for a while .
sure you did .
sure .
your daddy played .
i think you like learning .
sure .
i should show them an american ?
that you came upon carl by accident .
you wo n't hear that from hooks .
i want you . to tell the truth .
and what do you believe ?
right . in the middle . of the floor .
maybe .
yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .
and yet you started the engine right up .
did n't think about it at the time .
does it now ?
a little . yes . you have to wonder .
you have to wonder .
it is .
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery .
it was dead . we had it tested .
no spare .
no .
i 'm curious .
you do n't .
he was heavy , but we were real careful .
possible . but not darn likely .
and her farmhouse ... ?
the damage was considerable . but she 's insured .
< u > you < /u > said that .
as i testified .
obviously .
the same .
sure , anything 's poss ...
absolutely not . probably one or two hours .
not in those words .
so the defendant was encouraged to hope .
of course not . but it was emotional .
he had no reason to .
carl said he did n't like kabuo much anymore .
as i said , in every way .
maybe we could run some tests .
spirit ? oh !
yes . and that one , too .
okay , doll .
i suppose you want a tip ?
forget it , doll .
get lost , will you ?
bull fiddle .
beat it , buster .

i told you - it 's a sure thing .
i thought you were n't talking to me .

yeah , that 's what he means .
now you 're talking !
no - nothing .
they got the bull-fiddle .

as far away as possible .
that 's not far enough .
the police ? we 'd never live to testify .
we got to get out of town .
we are going out of town .

must be the way their weight is distributed .
quit stalling . we 'll miss the train .
i feel so naked .

i 'm not that sick .
i have a very low resistance .
i know where to get some .

and i smoke . i smoke all the time .
i do n't care .
and i have a terrible past .
and i can never have children .

but you do n't understand !
well - nobody 's perfect .
well , it is to me .
oh , that 's all taken care of .

you ai n't going nowhere .
we wo n't breathe a word .

what kind of band is this , anyway ?
you got to be under twenty-five -
william morris !

yes , we 're the new girls .
would you mind rejoining the living ?
all right - lets take it from the top .
on the baltimore and ohio .
oh .
i play the ukulele . and i sing too .
do n't get me started on that .
i would n't say that . careless , maybe .
no , just dumb .
i used to sing with male bands .
afford it ?
have you ever been with a male band ?
me ?
that 's what i 'm running away from .
rough ?
i 'll say .
you ca n't trust those guys .
i ca n't trust myself .
especially tenor sax .
every time !
you know - i play tenor sax .
but you 're a girl , thank goodness .
yeah .
that 's why i joined this band .
yeah .
you do n't know what they 're like .
brains are n't everything .
that 's a quarter of a century .
about what ?
about the future .
millionaires . flocks of them .
going to catch yourself a rich bird ?
maybe you 'll meet one too , josephine .
yeah .
glasses ?
well , now that you 've mentioned it -
search me . i mean - i 'll see .
i might as well stay in there .
why not ?
bienstock . he snores to beat the band .
want to switch berths with me ?
would you mind terribly ?
not at all .
good night , sugar .
saxophone player ?
what else ?
just my feminine intuition .
she does n't need one .
my fault .
you 're not hurt , are you ?
i do n't think so .
i wish you 'd make sure .
why ?
who are you ?
now , really -
not very likely .
are you staying at the hotel ?
not at all .
your face is familiar .
would you mind moving just a little ?
your view of what ?
certainly not .
and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ?
no , my cocktail steward .
well , i 'm not .
that 's very interesting .
up , up , up .
no - the ukulele . and i sing .
for your own amusement ?
you 're society girls ?
oh , yes . quite .
oh .
they do indeed .
- opening of the opera -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same four hundred .
tonight ?
it 's on the account of the shells .
you collect shells ?
yes .
please - no names . just call me junior .
yes , you 're in the way .

shell oil , junior .
shells ? whatever for ?
i am ?
for me ? it 's shell oil .

what is it ?
oh - a member of the herring family .
a herring ?
i do n't mind if i do .
down the hatch - as we say at sea .
bon voyage .
trophies .
water polo - is n't that terribly dangerous ?
i 'll say .
where 's your shell collection ?
yea , of course .
it 's the crews ' night off .
you mean we 're alone on the boat ?
completely .
harmless - how ?
they just sort of leave me cold .
you mean - like frigid ?
it 's more like a mental block .
have i ? i 'm trying all the time .
nothing at all ?
complete washout .
that makes me feel just awful .
oh , it 's not your fault .
you mean you ca n't fall in love ?
not anymore .
what happened ?
i do n't want to bore you .
oh , you could n't possibly .
yes .
ever since then - numb - no feelings .
you poor , poor boy .
is it that hopeless ?
why ?
thanks just the same .
i have .
what is it ?
i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
would you like a little more champagne ?
it 's like smoking without inhaling .
so inhale !
i 'm not quite sure . try it again .
thank you .
where did you learn to kiss like that ?
good morning .
let 's make it an even million .
did you have a nice time ?
nice ? it was suicidally beautiful .
from a rich millionaire .

'81 , i think .
so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
-- and then brought her down here --
the message does n't show a lack of intelligence .
that 's smart .
you do n't think weapons are important ?
i think we should be careful .
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...

maybe so .
jerry ?
jerry ? please . stop this .

she wired this system .
duly noted , ted .

it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .
that 's quite a secret .
wait -- down where ?
to the spacecraft . to investigate .
underwater ?
what do you expect ?
we ca n't go down there .
it never occurred to me .
the timing has never seemed quite right .

you 're jumping to conclusions , beth .
fuck you , norman ! it 's right here ...
where did you get this ?
in edmunds ' things .
you went through edmunds ' things ?
do n't tell me to calm down !
it 's done , alright ? it 's over !

beth , i did n't . hold it together .
beth --

it 's also our only way out of here !
you , me and harry ?
you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
wake him , then . let 's go .
we ca n't . the storm .
get the helium out of our bloodstream .
why should i go ?
you should know how it works .
in case you die , too ?
i do n't trust harry to do it .
i would . but my suit --

when did the messages start ?
you think , in the sphere --
he acquired some sort of power .
but how ?
i do n't know .
how can the sphere do that ?
i do n't know , beth .
it 's his fear . the squid .
but why is he doing it ?
he must not realize he is .

i need some money right now .
ca n't you wait till i 'm dummy ?
i 've lost my car .

i do n't need a tuxedo .

just follow me .
it 's those feathers . they tickle .
who ?
the other guests ?
there are no other guests .
a little .
i 'm in love with you .
`` mad about the boy . ''
norma , i ca n't take it .

demille is leo . i 'm scorpio .

so he said it quite a few years ago .
they 're awful . they make me cough .
you 're a darling .
i ran into some people i knew .
where are my cigarettes ?
where are your ... ?
nothing is the matter .
all right . give me this .
maybe demille is shooting .
i know that trick !
i do n't think so .
thank you , darling .
it could n't have gone better .
he'a a shrewd old fox .
yes , norma .
i 've lost half a pound since tuesday .

i went for a walk .
no you did n't . you took the car .
all right , i drove to the beach .
of course you have n't .
yes , i am , norma .
no , you 're not . max ! max !
max is a good idea .
norma , you 'd be throwing it away .
you think i made that up about the gun ...
you do n't care . do you ?
wake up , norma .
no , they do n't .
what about the studio ? what about de mille ?
he was trying to spare your feelings .
wanted what ?
that 's a lie !

norma , grow up .
goodbye . norma .
no one leaves a star .
go on in .
wipe your feet !
dressed for what ?
madame is waiting .
for me ? okay .
thanks .
thanks .
i sure turned into an interesting driveway .
you did , sir .
naturally . i brought them myself .
is that so !
why are you so upset ?
who said you could ? who asked you to ?
i 'm not here .
that 's what i told them .
good .
they found your car in the garage .
it was the room of the husband .
there are no locks anywhere in this house .
the doctor suggested it .
what doctor ?
madame 's doctor . she has moments of melancholy .
uh-huh ?
we have to be very careful .
why ? her career ?
i would n't look too closely at the postmarks .
you send them . is that it , max ?
i 'd better press your evening clothes , sir .
i do n't know , sir .
she is upstairs .
right with you .
he had a great big bungalow on wheels .
what ?
you made her a star ?
i directed all her early pictures .
and she 's turned you into a servant .
that 's right .
what car ?
is that so ?
i lent it to a friend of mine .
bases loaded . there 's a 4o-page outline .
no , that was me .
frankly , no .
now wait a minute .
along is no good . i need it now .
have n't got a thing .
any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .
there 's nothing , gillis .
goodbye , mr. sheldrake .
no ?
gillis , get this through your head .
what do you think i 've been doing ?
maybe what you need is another agent .
was it a sudden quarrel ?
did he have a wife ?
had he been trying to blackmail you ?
did you hate him ?
yes . madame .
you know better than to interrupt me .
paramount is calling .
who ?
paramount studios .
now , now do you belive me ?
it is not mr. demille in person .
certainly it 's important .
very good , madam .
the cameras have arrived , madame .
they have ? thank you , max .
this is the staircase of the palace .
oh , yes , yes .
all right . camera ! action !
but where ?
it 's big . and empty .
it could n't be helped .
but what will happen ?
the guardians will be angry .
the coffer of shadow . look at it .
the danger . the one nigel spoke of .
softball .
but which one ?
drive on . we have already attracted enough attention .
sorry , mistress .
he will be . in about five minutes .
have fun .
it 's what we were warned about .
no , a super girl .
eliminate her .
that 's easy for you to say , bianca .
you can do it .
am i ? still ?
i 've been saving it .
that moment is now !
the naming of names is not necessary .
whatever you say .
yes . whatever i say . from now on .
no way .
there 's no need .
what do you want ?
western europe .
no problem . she can have it .
it 's a warning , that 's for sure .
maybe it was just an accident .
there 's no such thing as an accident .
it 's for your own protection .
i 'm taking you to the hospital .
let me out .
later .
i have to .
when can i see , you again ?
relax .
who did n't ?
that woman who 's after me .
you love me ?
my angel . my goddess .
yes . it reminds me of home .
where superman 's from ? krypton ?
no . argo city .
it 's not important .
tell me where i can find her .
i do n't want you to go near her .
i 'll be safe with you .
we ca n't do that .
why not ?
we 're from different worlds .
you do n't like me ? you hate me ?
what do you feel about me ?
let me kiss you .
no .

what are you doing here ?
screaming
besides that .
he wants to see you . lex luthor .
the bald man !
look , lady , you saved my life once .
okay . take me to your leader .
me and my real estate ?
your father was a sick weirdo .
i know that .
compared to what came before ?
so i 've noticed .
criers and complainers ! that 's what i get !
even that would be an improvement .
what about dinner ?
first the pets , otis .
you think he 's for real ?
he 's from another world .
tough guy , huh ?
you 're on .
i did n't say a word .
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen. ,
fifty degrees below and still falling .
when it gets to seventy-five below , stabilize it .
krypton ? the place where superman comes from ?
i read the article .

see ? i see .
i 'm going to bed .
stay and listen !
deductive reasoning , my friends !
bingo !
la de da da ...

what do you suggest , my dear ?
you ever try to run in high heels ?
is that an innuendo , miss teschmacher ?
ready .
you ? ! how about me ?
you have two minutes and thirty- two seconds .
there was a recipe on the back --
something you can feed the pets , perhaps ?
hit you ? a clever girl like you ?
i knew you 'd hit me .
i know ...
baby -- i 'm going to take you higher .
yours not to reason why , miss teschmacher .
i did n't bring any --
not exactly .
what are you going to do to him ?
tea ?
you got wax in your ears ?
what if he does n't show up ?
he always shows up when somebody 's in danger .
lex is going bye-bye .
miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual .
i 'm wearing it .
i mean the other one !
what other one ?
you ca n't do this to me !
of course i can . i love you .
jor-el , be warned .
you are one of krypton 's greatest scientists jor-el -

this discussion is terminated .
if you persist , you leave us no choice .
an ode to spring .
gets you where you live , huh ?
what 's your name , boy ?
do n't just stand there gapin ' jonathan .
he sure as heck does that .
i was thinkin ' what to call him .
who ? clark ?
lara , please ...
but why earth , jor-el .
their atmosphere will sustain him .
he 'll be weightless .
yes , true .

i guess i got carried away
my son , i foresaw this . i knew -
no ! you could n't imagine -
how good it felt !
how good it felt -
twenty-four .
or twenty-four as it is in earth time .
okay , but ... why ? no offense .
he is . usually .
you 've got me ?
do as i say . let go !
oh , god ! i 'm going to die !
not while i 'm around you 're not .
let 's just say i 'm a friend .
not a chance .
right on the first guess .
wha ' ... what are you doing here ?
i came to talk to you .
the answer is yes .
this is incredible .
i think you 'll be able to remember it .
if i do , you can punish me .
who 's clark ? one of your colleagues ?
not exactly .
i 'd appreciate it if you did n't smoke .
oh . well , where do we start ?
ask , you 're the girl reporter .
okay .
you think they 're strange ?
i did n't mean that in any pejorative way .
i guess they are a little odd .
oh .
it 's not bad .
how old are you ?
thirty-five .
how much do you weigh ?
195 pounds .
what about this x-ray vision of yours ?
what about it ?

otis , were you up to your old tricks ?
i 'll always be grateful , mr. luthor .
i gave him steady employment --
i ... uh ... check .
i guess i ... uh ... regressed .
otis ...
it is for me .
y'know ? i 'm sure of it . y'know ?
it 's a twinkie , boss .
maybe it 's being polished or something .
cleaning a rock , otis ? jot it down .
ah , dear simple otis .
good enough for you .
plenty !
oh , that .
i do n't need a geography lesson , luthor .
no , superman , of course not .
of time , luthor .

we 'll see how fast i can fly .
alison jones .

i 'm just fine , ally .
i 'm fine . still working with my father .

i did n't know .
nothing . we made it to the hospital .
alison .
alison .

i will .
i hope she gets better .

i 'm not sure .
oh . right .
goodnight , nicole .
the children .
she 's resting . in her room .

c'mon , you know that wo n't ...
why ?
it 's not enough . for hospital bills .
i 'm sorry .
billy , that 's too early .

no . it should be dry by now .
when the game 's over , i guess .
it 's natural .
your kids never cry .
they can look forward to that .
sure .
just like we look forward to this .
i better get back .
good night .
something made this happen , billy .
... or that the guardrail was n't strong enough .
you believe that ?
i have to .
why ?
because i have to .
well i do n't .
yes .
why did you do that , billy ?
you think that caused the accident , risa ?
what do you mean by that , dolores ?
about the ottos ?
yes . what do you mean by 'hippies ' ?
do they have any reputation for drugs ?
no , nothing like that .
oh yes .
for rabbits ?

too christian . you know jameson ? paul virilio ?
abstraction . they 're obsessed with abstraction .
i work at the big boy warehouse .
where 'd you read all that stuff ?
i just read it ... .
you want it to be an event .
are they still together ?
he 's in a mental institution ... .
is he a nazi ?
i guess . his parents are .
what 's he care about ?
killing himself .
that 's stupid . why would they ?
yes , i am . basically i am .
oh , really ?
bigger and better .
then how come you 're talking to me ?
why wo n't you talk to me ?
i 'm talking to you right now .
you ca n't .
he 's at a home out here .
no .
i stole it . from a synagogue .
do you know it like that ? by heart .
no .
but you can read it , the hebrew ... .
what do you care ?
oh , yeah ...
why ?
hebrew 's very difficult . it would take years .
i 'm good at languages .
yeah , it 's stupid .
you ca n't curse in front of it either .
good question . both . aleph ...
it looks a little like a swastika .
it 's silent .
they do n't put them in the torah .
the sex is better .
even though his dick is so big ?
with you there 's a tragic dimension .
vuv ... zayin ... chet ... tet ...
v'asitem ...
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat .
nothing but nothingness ... judaism 's not about belief .
what 's it about ?
about doing things .
no . nothing follows .
fuck that .
do n't curse in front of it .
why should i submit ?
you should n't .
judaism does n't even need god .
i told you , i 'm good at this .
plus you have nothing else to do all day .
it 's all you talk about .
do they ?
'cause he was n't a rabbi .
you want a punch in the mouth ?
i mean kiddush . let 's say kiddush .
is it like eichmann ? are we goofing ?
i do n't know .
shit ... did you talk to your mother today ?
no . what are you looking for ?
nothing . why are you doing this ?
and be crushed .
yeah , okay .
you eat first , then you light .
you got ta get out of here .
you do n't own this place .
i did n't realize you cared .
i do n't .
he called me up .
i 'll go look ... .
who 's eichmann ? ! ! ?
what 'd you say ?
nothing . let 's go ... .
i 'm stealing it .
yes , of course .
he 's jewish ? manzetti ?
obviously .
decentralized , nonviolent , increasingly mainstream .
people hate jews . do you agree ?
they used to .
i 'd say nothing .
is n't that what we want ?
how would you kill him ?
they 're liars and cowards .
i 'm sure they are .
it 's the truth ... .
what about mrs. moebius and ... ?
they left an hour ago .
a week or so .
what 's that ? okay . surprise us ...
no ... yeah , fine , go ahead ...
i agree .
what should i be , a white inferior- ist ?
danny , what about the jews ?
let me give you an example ... . sexuality .
sexuality ? ? ? what do you mean ?
you ever fuck a jewish girl ?
what ? ? ! ?
did you ever fuck one , guy ?
and ? what did you notice ?
notice ? like what ... ?
jewish girls like to give head , right ?
i do n't know . is that right ?
and jewish men like to get it .
everybody likes to , do n't they ?
yes . it 's very pleasurable .
why ?
because the jew is essentially female .
female ...
does that mean the jew is the better lover ?
you 're not listening . he is n't better .
the jews clearly control the media and the banks .
he has israel .
those are n't jews .
of course they 're jews .
notice the israelis : a fundamentally secular society .
are all jews the same ?
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ?
so you 're saying it 's not true .
look at me . do i look jewish ?
do you know who you 're fucking with here ?
listen to me ... .
why would nadelman lie ?
to discredit me .
it 's slander . it 's reckless disregard .
no .
what were you , following me ?
how do you reconcile the two ?
i do n't .
yeah , and what are you ?
who killed manzetti ?
it 's too late ... .
get the fuck away from me .
the arguments , anyway .
to hear them read torah .
i thought you hated torah .
this is me .
how did you ... ?
i work in the da 's office .
with the shoes ... there was more than one ?
a forty-five .
it was a nine millimeter .
you 're lying .
so are you ...
i was just talking .
think about your father . your sister .
fucking kike .
there 's a bomb here .
i want you to say kaddish for her .
you do it on the inside ... .
do n't tell me what i --
yes !
daniel balint .
balint ?
it 's german .
what part of germany are you people from ?
from the rhineland originally .
are you with the fbi , mr .
i was going to ask you the same thing .
we 're already marginal .
so what jew would you kill first ?
ilio manzetti ... former ambassador to france .
you mean ilio manzetti ?
forget manzetti ... . take on something simple .
fine .
lina ... it 's happening . tonight .
what is happening ?
beth shalom . like you wanted .
beth shalom ? what are you talking about ?
that 's meat .
look , you want cheese , go someplace else .
but it 's stupid , right ?
no , i do n't admit it 's stupid .
steve ...
steve 's going to explain it .
i just came to get some stuff .
then he could n't be bitter about living alone .
why deprive him of his greatest pleasure ?
they 're not my people ... .
tell it to hitler .
oh , he decides ?
the polacks ? from sacred heart ?
nobody ever beat me up .
i 've got to get back to the --
you can heat them up and eat with him .
daniel balint ? my name 's guy danielsen .
who told you that ?
is n't it true ?
a jewish prayer .
number ten .
her place is down the road .
you could do it .
get out of here ... .
you look right through him .
the mother .
green dot -- shotgun powder . for pipe bombs .
what ... ?
here ...
that damn thing .
i 'm sorry , danny .
i 've got ta kill some jews , kyle .
it will .
no , it 's weird , man .
it 'll be enough if we use it right .
keep driving . do n't slow down .
christ ...
you said they did n't have night guards .
they do n't .
mrs. moebius .
why ? why would she ?
the manzetti thing must have scared her .
so what do we do with the device ?
i have an idea ... .
no , it has to be tomorrow .
it 's not going to be fine .
just do it .
seven-thirty tomorrow evening .
so that 's what ?
i 'm in the rabbinic program at jts ...
jts ... ?
what about you ? what are you doing ?
yeah , hey , how 're you doing ...
wow , that 's uh ... great ...
you want to kill a jew .
four . but no one this important .
i can tell ... .
how ?
i was a jew in a previous life .
i 'm a bad shot .
just get him in the cross-hairs .
i did n't .
what 's that ?
what are you trying to say ?
the nazi 's killing his kid .
okay , that 's it .
what do you think you should have done ?
... we have nothing to learn from these people .
do i give a shit ?
exactly .
dennis leary .
leary ?
no .
obviously .
funny ?
not like mr. dorfmann .
he was funny .
and that 's when the mets started to stink .
'cause they got rid of johnson .
valentine ...
linda says you 're not supposed to have dairy .
just a little ... what 's the difference ?
fund-raising ? ?
we think you 'd be good at it .
so what ?
they 're not that jewish .
i do n't care what they are .
what ?
we redesigned the timing mechanism .
danny , please .
i was just trying to make a point .
and let us say ...
i think anti-semitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon .
curtis is always more complicated than he seems .
yes . not like enzo .
i think , he 's really nice ...
yes .

no .

jeanne , you 've been badly wounded ...
well ...

yes ...
it 's over , jeanne .
jeanne , no ...
yes .
because there 's an arrow in your leg .

it 's been weeks since they spoke to me .
maybe their silence is a sign ... ?
it 's not time yet .
you make it sound so simple ...
tell the king to give me more men .
jeanne ...
to be killed in battle ?
it would not be the same without you .
not yet !

i want to stay with you ...
that 's an order !
i -- i do n't understand ...

you do n't know what you 're saying .
i 'm staying , jean .
jeanne , you ca n't leave us like this !
good .
we have to press home the attack !
sound the retreat ...
but i promised jeanne we 'd fight on !
i made no such promise .
but that was her order !
i 'm fed up with taking her orders .
no ...
did god forbid you to tell the truth ?
no .
it was on a sunday , was n't it ?
i do n't remember . maybe .
quite a few .
did n't you also carry a banner ?
yes ...
and so i ... i prefer my banner .
why ?
to avoid killing anyone .
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword ?
yes , but ...
yes , maybe ... i do n't remember ...
oh yes , my lady .
well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...
thirty years ago ?
performing a miracle .
what are you doing ?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty ...
scared to make a mistake .
am i ... am i dead ?
dead you 're worthless , darling .
where ... where am i ?

your king ?
and god who allowed you to be caught ?
no no , i 'm fine , really ...

praying .
the voice was in your cell ?
yes .
what did it tell you ?
many things ...
did it give you advice ? good advice ?
is it here ? now ? in this room ?
no ... i want to be confessed .
you have nothing to regret ...
silence her ! take her away ... !
and you ? why did you lie ?
thanks be to god .
and your duke ? the duke of bedford ?
not so well , i regret to say .
this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation .
mmmm . yes .
for the sake of france , charles .
then her faith will have to be bigger .
i 'm ... i 'm not the king ...
i did n't wait long .
... and my crown does n't fit and ...
you must n't see her , my lord .
if she comes from burgundy it makes a difference .
... to ensure our privacy .
his face .
does he have hair ?
yes .
is it long and hanging down ?
go on to the next question .
that 's enough !
that 's not a lot .
it is all his majesty can afford .

good . where are the english ?
everywhere . where is the food ?
it 's coming -- i rode on ahead .

and it 's not the first one !
oh , but i forgot !
good idea ...
no good ? this is a disaster !
i do n't think .
the english are rebuilding it .
perfectly .
no ... not like this ...
maybe ...
so ... bring up the reinforcements !
reinforcements ? where ? ?
never look behind -- only ahead !
of course i do ? bring them up !
the clothes are not important ...
did your voice tell you to jump ?
no ...
and you did n't jump of your free will ?
no !
oh ? perhaps someone pushed you then ?
nothing ... just taking his teeth .
because ... because you just ca n't !
that 's different ...
here -- take this instead .
hey , my friend !
god knows , but it was a bad idea !
were the men confessed ? where are the priests ?
what 's the use ? the drawbridge is up !
not for long ...
won ? !
... the smell of victory , jeanne ! mmmmmmm !
it 's not possible ...
jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ...
if you kill him , you kill me !
we still believe in you , jeanne .
who gave you that horse ?
my king .
how many did he give you ?
five steeds and a few hackneys ...
as much as for a lord ?
playing ...
i -- i -- i ...

i might ask you the same question .
i ... i 'm leaving ...
i ... i never lied !
i told you already ...

why ? are you waiting for someone else ?
yes !
who ?
i want to see that .

that vibe is from your wrist , pal .
she smiles at everyone , ted .
were you always this sick ?
i defy any and all limits .
seriously , it 's like we 're being reborn .
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
and nobody knows you 're a virgin !
well , dad said ...
maybe he got promoted .
oh . well . maybe not yet .
not ever . never .
i 'd kiss your mother with this mouth .
yeah , whatever .
i better go , dad .

beauty ? no . we 're talking goddess .
dead ?
our plane crashed . in the grand canyon .
it 's a lot to digest .
i 'd feel like staying up all night !
take a whiff of heaven .
give me those !
sorry .
you 'll never believe who 's in there .
it better not be my aunt trudy .
chicks are like buses .
no , leave one .
brilliant !
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty .
except the girl .
oh , god . look . look .
we reinvented ourselves .
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man .
jealousy is so unattractive .
he kicked major ass and you know it .
you go first .
ladies first . i insist .
well . the prom 's coming up .
yeah ?
and i was wondering .
yeah ?
if you do n't have ... i mean ...
you like me . i like you .
i do n't like you .
but that smile .
oh , ted , duh .
so that 's a maybe ?
the answer is never , ted , never .
yeah ? you like ?
makes your shoulders look so big and broad .
christy ?
i turned eighteen over spring break .
do it ?
you know ... take the pictures ?
which you pulled , hard !
that was code for `` i like you . ''
you have changed since second grade .
i mean , what do you think ?
maybe on the outside .
of course , dumpling .
i always wanted craftsman tools .
oh , honey .
we love our lives just the way they are .
we miss you . we miss our son .
we miss our family .
dad , please .
grandpa was so strong back then .
it was the year of the rhizopus rot .
i 'm getting so good at this .
of course we are .
they did n't want me when i was born .
well , why should i ?
they had a rough life .
i guess .
they did do one great thing .
yeah .
be a sport .
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
... not the pit .
just say it , dad .
well , good . every little bit helps .
we 're grateful , ted .
it 's okay . you need me ?
your mom said you 've been ignoring your chores .
you ordered a winnebago ?
i will not have my boys arguing .
they 're in the ignition , silly .
got it .
it 's your car .
some of them have to be automatics .
your father liked shifting .
i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
the one with the horses .
that 's me .
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room .
hi ho , silver .
what do you mean ? i 'm ted nelson .
and who is ted nelson ?
i always knew there was more .
hmmm ?
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?
whatever you want .
what do you want me to do ?
this is humiliating .
hang in there , i 'll think of something .
so here we are . dead .
everything .
i 'm helen mcdole .
we 'll send you the release forms , ted .
they kept this scrapbook of your life .
are they hitting you up for donations ?
what about the future ?
you can call me jimmy again .
most places are , jimmy .
my new bike .
very funny .
better view , more spacious , new carpet .
it 's not up to me .
mom and dad said it 's yours .
you can have it , then .
you want it in writing ?
just a formality .
are you kidding ?
you ca n't come back .
funny you should say that .
i meant biologically .
that 's a crappy thing to say .
look ted . i 'm cool with everything .
i did n't forget .
look , i loved `` exposed ! ''
go ahead . ask her to the prom .
i have absolutely no intention --
-- do it . i triple-dog-dare you .
but you triple-dog-dared me .
your article sucked .
in what sense ?
i 'm still better than you .
me ?
`` local boy inherits more money than god . ''
really ? you wan na write about me ?
i do n't get the distinction .
i see .
interesting .
you never know around here .
funny you should say `` peachy . ''
i did my homework .
my adoptive grandfather .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
why ca n't you be nice to me ?
you 've got enough people kissing your ass .
to the best hiding place in the world .
whatever .
not `` whatever . ''
he cared enough to want you to have it .
he phoned it in .
i see .
i doubt it .
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .
i mean my father .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted .
it 's all so complicated .
it 's incredibly simple .
i feel like i 'm being drawn and quartered .
and then what ?
i know .
in a word : merk . exposed .
that 's two words .
there 's got ta be something .
well ? where the hell are you ?
he 's on the move ?
wearing them ? or humping them ?
what about you ?
i 'm very aural .
tell me more .
sounds , voices , music , humming .
you live and learn .
not a chance .
come on .
trust is something you earn , over time .
maybe someday .
but absolutely true .
aw julie , it 's my job .
you think you 're working with chimps here ?
the thing is , i made a commitment .
i 'm not going anywhere , ted .
i graduated from college .
yellow pages ?
let your fingers do the walking .
you better .
what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?
charlie , at a will reading ?
did you have a nice flight ?
yeah , i 'm doing fine .
save it , honey .
what is all this ?
just a few tokens of my affection .
only the best for my mother .
you promise you 'll finish school ?
i 'll make you very proud .
you 're free .
like what ?
like take that trip to buckingham palace .
forget the store . think big .
oh , teddy . we missed you so much .
do n't say `` shit , '' honey .
thanks , principal merkin .
i 'll be blunt .
yes , sir . i 'll brace myself .
that 's a good start , yes .
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
what kind of sick question is that ?
come on , it 's our only senior prom .
deaf ears , mr. nelson .
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ?
mr. nelson , you disappoint me .
what law , merk ? having fun ?
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
uh , sure . uncle billy .
i have only one concern ...
of course i like girls .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?
as much as possible .
you 're sure ?
seldom ? no kidding ?
tipping ?
yeah . everything 's cool .
just a couple of finishing touches .
you ? nervous ?
all those people out there .
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i do ?
you are a multi-media magnate .
me ? the king of coitus ?
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .
whoa . but ... that 's the thing ...
why , look who 's here .
i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .
i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
my parents always say hard work builds character .
what kind of ideas ?
the world is a big , beautiful place .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
i 'm ted nelson .
really ? so i 'm doing ok ?
he was in a league of his own .
it was incredible .
thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .
you 're a great kid .
my job . back off , benedict .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that 's right .
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit .
people pay good money for that ?
i 'm just a messenger .
i 'm terrible at this . i blurt .
you 've got the wrong guy .
it 's spring break .
i 'm seventeen .
your fathered owned the entire `` heaven '' empire .

what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
she just upped the stakes .

elektra would control it all .
we go down to the torpedo bay .
hes going to insert the plutonium .
like riding a bike .
just wanted to put him on edge ...
count to twenty . ill be there .
we cant .
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ?
james . it wouldnt really be ...

since oxford .
who buys classified reports for three million pounds .
shes not a girl anymore .
its barely a scratch .
caviar capital of the world . matchless beluga .
and now its up for grabs , a goldrush .
i took the initiative .
you havent been given an assignment in this case .
i was the one who brought that money in ...
who ?
claude serrault . a.k.a ...
renard .
how many deaths is he responsible for ?
now robert is dead . he got his revenge .
hes not through yet .
is maybe ... the inside woman .
i am just a middle man .
your last chance . give me the name .
i cant tell you ... alright , alright !
indeed .
you think i fear death ? i welcome it .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
consider me ungrateful .
shell get over it .
you even brought the plane for us .
havent you heard the news ? so is she .
yes .
you knew him well ?
im sorry .
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream .
yes .
god no .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
partially , yes .
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere .
how long has he been with you ?
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
its my fathers pin .
its not the pin your father wore .
you are wrong , mr . bond .
always wanted to see the upper lines .
were alright .
youre not going to .
its the only way out ...
i know .
... you should rest .
i have to go .
then take me with you .
no . youll be safe here .
i dont want to be safe !
i have to go to work .
two . shaken not stirred .
not at that price . time to surrender .
shush .

what are you talking about ?
we had a run-in , he and i .
i dont know what youre talking about !
i think you do .
you knew .
not interested .
soon shell be everywhere .
five more turns and your neck will break .
just like you ... only you were even easier .
