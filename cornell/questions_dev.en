there 's nothing we can do .
we ca n't just go off and --
worn down to nothing now .
the us army : always an adventure .

they could be just about --
and they ca n't fly around out there forever .
missile !
epps !

you 're the one with all the ideas .
maybe you 've already got things worked out .

liar . he wanted the gold .
he could n't even know we had it .
you said he was a deserter .
he could be a spy , or something .
you do n't know that .
you 're out of your mind .
he 's an enemy soldier .
i 'm not going to let you kill him .
we have no authority --
i 've got no stomach for murder .
then step aside .
no .
always giving orders .
i 'm the one 's got the big stick .
i suppose .
you left me for dead .
thanks for taking care of this for me .
just keep quiet .
i have to answer him .
at-at-at-at-at . at-at-at-at-at .

there might be something in there .

what do we do with the humvee ?
say it !
you do n't have to go so fast .
faster we get there , faster we get back .

we 're in this together , understand ?
i do n't hear any --

it 's a fire fight .
iraqis . a bunch of them .
they 're doing more than slapping .
they 'd cut us to shreds .
x marks the spot .
where is it ? where 'd it go ?
stay low .
where the hell is it ! ?
what the hell are we going to do ?
we 're not going to do anything .
they 're going to kill us !
if they land --
a whole lot of nothing .
what are you doing ?
what does it look like i 'm doing ?
it looks like you 're not doing anything .
get up and dig .
must be a compartment .
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
it 's just a mongoose .
is it dead ?
and it 's heavier than i imagined .
wait .
he 's not going to leave us .
why do i have to stay down here ?
wes might be right about that .
we should head northeast .

we 'll find our way .
how ! ?
we got to go back for wes .
forget wes .
we ca n't just leave him .
wes is dead !
no .
we 'll lie .

you 're going to get us in trouble .

and he would have a little more time for --
for all the really important things --
yes , madame ?
i think you 'd better go .
ever had a romance with a crook ?
i beg your pardon !
you 've got your money --
two men of your standing , always quarreling .
he started it .
but you 're the more intelligent one .
that 's true .
then why did you do it ?
because i hate him -- because i love you !
you were in the army .
your bag ?
yes , my bag !
did n't you take it with you ?
do n't you know where it is ?

rose calvert .
i told you you wanted to take this call .
none of the stewards have seen her .
she 's not on the starboard side either .
i make my own luck .
we 're too late .
what could possible be funny ?
mind your step .
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable .
you know i do n't like that , rose .
it 's bad luck .
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money .
what did you think you were doing ? !
cal , stop ! it was an accident .
an accident ? !
my god ... cal . is it a --
i was tired .
something serious has happened .
to be a whore to that gutter rat ?
is this in any way unclear ?
what do i tell your mother ?
you 're precious to me , rose .
sure . count me in .
this should be amusing .
no thanks . i 'm heading back .
both of us .
you 're a good liar .
almost as good as you .
sorry fabrizio .
full house boys !
we 're practically goddamned royalty , ragazzo mio ! !
you know somebody ?
bollocks .
cor ... look at that , would ya .
oy , mate ... that was a close shave .

i say we go back .
they 'll pull us right down i tell ya !
why have we stopped ?
i 'll pull you back in .
i mean it . i 'll let go .
no you wo n't .

the fall alone would kill you .

i know what ice fishing is !
you 're crazy .

but for your discretion .
you 're welcome . rose .
what does she know about misery ?
i 'll show them . they 'll be sorry !
'course you 'll be dead .
penguin ? oh , cal ! he is them .
is he your boyfriend ?
yes , exactly !
so do n't marry him .
if only it were that simple .
what 's this ?
just some sketches .
and these were drawn from life ?
you used her several times .
no , no ! just with her hands .
you do . you see people .
and ... ?
i 'm sorry . really ... i am .
i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece .
a whole ten cents ? !
scandalous ! can you show me ?
sure . if you like .
it 's unfair .
may i cut in , miss ?
i do n't know the steps .
there 's been a mistake .
a mistake ?
you got mailed to the wrong address .
look ! a shooting star .
jack , i --
i 'll be fine . really .
fabrizio said you might be up --
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere .
what is it ? a sapphire ?
i ca n't imagine monsieur monet blushing .
pretty tough for a valet , this fella .
where to , miss ?
are you nervous ?
you 're trembling .
this is crazy .
looks okay . i do n't see anything .
could it have damaged the ship ?
it 's bad .
we have to tell mother and cal .
now it 's worse .
i jump , you jump ... right ?
this is horseshit .
do n't !
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket .
i know , i know .
you have to go for help .
i 'll be right back .
will this work ?
i 'm not going without you .
you jump , i jump , right ?
some debris ... wood ... anything .
it 's so cold .
it 's getting quiet .
do n't do it .
not this night . do you understand me ?
i ca n't feel my body .
i promise .
never let go .
maintain speed and heading , mr. lightoller .
the valet . did he have the combination ?
maybe she wants to make peace with the past .
you think she was really there ?
is your stateroom alright ?
is n't that right , sweetie .
would you like anything ?
do you know who the claiment was , rose ?
someone named hockley , i should imagine .
it 's been 84 years ...
do n't come any closer .
my god , rose , what 's gotten into --
mother , may i introduce jack dawson .
you know the money 's gone !
it 's so unfair .
rose , get in the boat !
anya !
then why the sudden exit without even telling me ?
do you want the truth , anya ?
it would be a nice change from you .
i had an idea your husband was getting suspicious .
sure !
hope we 're not intruding .
this is miss marsh .
well -- shall we go into dinner ?
i can explain --
you 're such a swine !

i 've heard of you back in new york .
i do n't understand .
will you pardon me ?
no-o !
what did you want a gun for ?

you 're coming back --
how about a little game later ?
could i see you a minute ?
i 'm so sorry !

very much --
you 've got lipstick all over you .
where have you been hiding ?
that was sweet of you -- thank you .

nineteen-sixty-seven .
running time ?

healthier . radiant even .
the park ?

who wrote it ?
roald dahl .
what about the untouchables ?
i do n't rate that at all .
despite the academy award ?
that means fuck all . the sympathy vote .
is that it ?
yeah .
that 's your theory ?
yeah , beautifully fucking illustrated .

sick boy reaches out to allison .

the sick boy method .
yeah , well , it surely worked for him .
he 's always been lacking in moral fibre .
he knows a lot about sean connery .

your favourite dish .
excellent .
your usual table , sir ?

can we go home now ?
how 's it going with gail ?
no joy yet .
how long is it ?
six weeks .
six weeks !
where did she come up with that ?
she read it in cosmopolitan .
let 's put it behind us .
went ballistic ?
so what 's it going to be ?
we go for a walk .
what ?
a walk .
well , what are you waiting for ?
what do you see as your main strengths ?
like beggars .
homeless people ?
qual se tu ?
magnificent . you are the first to find me .
we sought only your infinite wisdom .
and how did you breach the barrier ?
it could . yes .
then i shall make use of this starship .
he has his doubts ...
why have you done this to my friend ?
no , no , it 's not possible .
bring me the ship or i will destroy you !
i could n't help but notice you pain .
my pain ?
shore leave 's been cancelled .
rescued at last .
you 'll never live it down .
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees .
it 's a miracle !
admit it . we 're lost .
we 've been caught in a blizzard !
sulu , what are you doing ?
plotting our new course .
what 's going on here ?
following new course . warp seven .
shuttle en route .
position , bird of prey ?
she must have cloaked .
raise shields .
but the shuttle-
what 's emergency landing plan b ?
this is the starship enterprise .
a federation starship .
what 's going on ?
you are under attack by federation forces .
can we have it quiet ?
enterprise , this is starfleet operations . come in .
bob ?
on `` the planet of galactic peace ? ''
there must be other ships in the quadrant .
captain , i need jim kirk .
have the klingons responded ?
no , but you can bet they will .
your pain runs deep .
what do you know of my pain ?
where did you get this power ?
how can i repay you for this miracle ?
join my quest .
what is it you seek ?
but to find it we 'll need a starship .
there are no starships on nimbus iii .
perhaps i have a way to bring one here .
but how ?
captain , we ca n't trust anyone now .
you ca n't miss it .
i might be able to take two of you .
why did n't you beep my communicator ?
captain , starfleet transmission on line .
standard orbit , mr. sulu .
they 're demanding to know our intentions .
which would n't be far from the truth .
we 're barely receiving transmission .
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two .
and that is ?
because it 's there .
ah , captain ?
i do n't understand .
what are you doing ?
`` pack up your troubles . ''
captain ?
you can call me jim .
jim .
yes , spock ?
life is not a dream .
go to sleep , spock .
yes , captain .
goodnight , spock .
i could use a shower .
not general korrd .
you look like you 've seen a ghost .
do you know this vulcan ?
i can not be certain .
i do not often think of the past .
but he was a revolutionary .
estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear .
i recommend we land at coordinate 8563 .
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city .
to land any closer would risk detection .
spock .
yes , captain ?
be one with the horse .
you must allow us to act .
damnit , spock . god damnit !
i do not expect you to forgive me .
i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass !
i ordered you to defend this ship .
you made that up !
i did not .
i do not have a brother .
there , you see ? see ?
i have a half brother .
for that , i 'm sorry .
it is escape-proof .
is it possible ?
is what possible ?
no probe has ever returned .
sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known .
i am here , captain .
uh ... .that 's an `` s . ''
`` b '' .. `` a '' ... um ...
i believe i have found a faster way .
hmmm ?
it would appear we are too heavy .
spock .
... mark two .
spock ... do n't .
what is this ?
spock ?
spock , i thought i was going to die .
i 've lost a brother .
who are you ?
james t. kirk , captain of the enterprise .
no ! no reply . remain on course .
we must change our course at once .
are you afraid to hear me out ?
spock ... what have you done to my friends ?
no ... i did n't .
now learn something about yourself .
your vision ?
he waits for us on the other side .
you are mad !
about the ship ...
the ship needs its captain .
no special conditions ?
what have i done ?
kirk to enterprise . listen carefully ...
you always do .
easy . you 're back with us .
scotty , dear , he ' not a madman .
he 's not ?
however , if you surrender now-
i am a starfleet officer .
sybok , you must surrender .
spock , you will accompany me to the bridge ?
no . i will not .
each man 's pain is unique .
i hide no pain .
i know you better than that .
spock ?
i can not go with you .
why not ?
i belong here .
sybok .
this is my arrogance ... my vanity ...
sybok , we must find a way ...
you did break in .
if i had a direct terminal ...
i do n't get it .
you invented space paranoids ?
?
senior exec .
dillinger ?
hi , alan .
want one ?
how 's it going upstairs ?
did he say why ?
why are you so interested ?
flynn had group 7 access .
i 'm not interested in talking about him .
i 've totally gotten over it .
okay , okay ...
i want to go to his place .
you call that getting over it ?
what for ?
to warn him .
of what ?
for what ?
for being on to dillinger .
flynn !
i do n't think i 'm cleared for this .
beautiful !
come on in ...
alan . alan bailey .
yeah ... ?
someone with that access has been tampering .
what 's the thing you 're working on ?
i sent you a memo on it .
mmm . part of the master control program ?
it can watchdog the mcp as well .
what do you mean , `` 'yes '' ?
only yes and no ... you 're a bit .
for sure ...
wo n't it miss you ?
i 'm your program ?
way to go ! we 're haulin ' !
this honey does n't handle so good in town ...
this town 's full o ' live ones .
you said it .
yes !
he 's nosing around again .
flynn ?
meanwhile ...
meanwhile , he might find it .
just to be safe .
there 's a 68.71 percent chance you 're right .
cute .
ed , i am so very disappointed in you .
how many programs i 've appropriated ?
now , wait a minute -- i wrote you .
i 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then .
what do you want with the pentagon ?
you would n't dare .
user requests are what computers are for .
sometimes i wish i was back in that garage ...
that was uncalled-for .
yes ?
i ... have come to communicate with my user .
well i want to communicate --
hah .
who is your user , program ?
alan !
where did you hear that name ?
well , is n't it -- ?
but how ... ?
what 's that ?
flynn ! !
greetings , program ...
you 're alive !
wrote the ... ?
i mean in here . out here . whatever .
then ...
programs have a way of just ... disappearing here .
not us , i hope .
did we make it ?
hey ... you guys ok ?
a user -- in our world ?
there 's another beam !
flynn , we 've got to help him !
why ? what are you going to do ?
but ... wo n't you be de-rezzed ?
flynn ... you ca n't ... i
yeah , yeah -- that 's great .
flynn ! look , tron , he survived !
watch it !
feel what ? you okay ?
never fails ... minute the warranty runs out ...
hey ... !
we have to talk .
so ... how 's the world of serious science ?
have you been sneaking into the icom system ?
you 've got to find that file before he does..
which branch of the service ?
a user ?
but-what if i ca n't ... ?
wait ... i need that ...
yes ... acknowledge , master control ...
these things take time .
new guy ...
what do you think ?
you think we can make it there ?
yori ... hey ...
i 'm afraid to even go out during down-time ...
that 's all going to change , yori ...
how ?
my quarters .
why is everything ... like this ?
you 've grown , big program .
what is it ?
power surge ... the transmission beam 's too strong !
we have to get off this beam !
nice ...
it 's something users do .

its cramped in here is n't it brian
so there is only one key ...
that 's right ...

why ?

no she did n't ...
do you dress up leslie ?
i do n't know ...
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
how long have you been watching me ?
tell me how it happened ...
why should i ?
i never knew my real mother - i was adopted
you think i killed my mother do n't you ?
stephanie became my mother .
stephanie ?
my sister - my adopted sister -
what ?
this is like a purging for me ...
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
what 's wrong ?
what 's wrong ?
what is it ?
yes ...
you must be madder than i thought ...
where are you going ?
leslie ? is that good enough ?
first finish your tea ...
why did you let him in ?
i have n't been using it recently leslie
whats wrong ... what have i done wrong ?
nothing leslie - i just think we should wait ...
do n't you want me now leslie
well , what do you think ?
what 's wrong with you ?
i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie
what ?
i want you out now
who the hell do you think you are ?
what happened ?
i had an accident - i fell down stairs ...
it 's been what , three years ?
what 's this all about ?
surgery ? are you a doctor ?
just put it in my room
her husband left her
dr steckler ?
sugar ?
spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation ...
you and your pep talks .
i feel a vibe .
see ? did you see that ?
do n't knock it till you tried it .
that 's crazy talk .
poor freud , turning in his grave .
nobody knows about your massive humiliation .
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
who the hell was your father ?
... a bouncer ? are you serious ?
there are no wild sex orgies .
oh . well . maybe not yet .
you kiss your mother with that mouth ?
so far away ? in xenia ?
check this out . hurry !
hurry .
what is it now ?
another vision of incomparable beauty ?
you and me . we 're dead .
dead ?
all of this is yours .
imagine how you 'd feel .
oh , how inappropriate is that !
she was n't your mother mother --
you 're late , bro !
ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
you 'll never believe who 's in there .
i thought i loved her .
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of 'em !
get them together .
holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?
you got everything you ever wanted .
never say never .
what gives , don corleone ?
we reinvented ourselves .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .
he has a future in yellow journalism .
from your lips , to god 's ears .
you go first .
ladies first . i insist .
well . the prom 's coming up .
yeah ?
and i was wondering .
yeah ?
ted , have you lost your mind ?
i guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone .
we 're just friends .
but that smile .
it 's , like , a caveman thing !
so that 's a maybe ?
great jacket , teddy bear .
yeah ? you like ?
hi , teddy bear .
you want to be in `` heaven ? ''
we should do it . now .
do it ?
blue gingham dress . blond ponytail .
which you pulled , hard !
well ?
you have changed since second grade .
you were porterhouse .
it 's much too expensive . right , dear ?
sweetheart , what is it ?
he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors .
something real and honest .
but we can get past all that .
we miss you . we miss our son .
seems like a lifetime ago .
dad , please .
you 're way ahead of me again ?
and it usually works out peachy in the end .
you guys are my parents .
of course we are .
son .
well , why should i ?
there was no place for a baby .
i guess .
they gave us our boy .
yeah .
how bad could spring break in los angeles be ?
always remember , focus on the peach ...
you know i 'm lousy with words .
including the bookstore .
finally , some gratitude .
sorry i --
it 's okay . you need me ?
now you 're ashamed of me ?
shut your pie hole , jimmy .
i-i do n't have the keys .
and slide the stick into first gear .
it 's a very expensive car .
these are all your cars .
some of them have to be automatics .
i think i forgot to say that .
i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
the one with the horses .
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room .
who exactly are you ?
what do you mean ? i 'm ted nelson .
it 's in your blood .
teddy ? i was thinking .
hmmm ?
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?
ted ! do something !
what do you want me to do ?
we 're being ejected from a prom !
the rest is history .
that is , we want you to have everything .
you 're on the next plane home .
you think that would be a problem ?
you mean they knew who i was ?
well , jay . they 've been exceptionally supportive .
andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols .
james , what are you doing here ?
impressive . this is bigger than our whole house .
so , what brings you here at his hour ?
my new bike .
my room ?
it 's a no-brainer .
it 's not up to me .
they seem to think you 're coming home .
if you could just sign right there .
you want it in writing ?
we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
i miss them , too .
you 're a peach .
he was my grandfather , too .
i meant biologically .
that 's a crappy thing to say .
their kids .
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?
me-ow .
get it over with .
i have absolutely no intention --
she 's got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .
your balls need scratching ?
your article sucked .
i 'm trying to help .
then i 'll write about you .
me ?
call me crazy , but i smell human interest .
or different like a lesbian in pumps ?
i felt like i was suffocating .
i guess .
she said peanuts , you cretin .
life must be peachy on planet ted .
funny you should say `` peachy . ''
your grandfather was a peach farmer .
who knows what my biological grandfather did .
charlie 's right . jealousy is so unattractive .
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
why ca n't you be nice to me ?
where are we going ?
he did n't . he had it built .
whatever .
it 's two different things .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
he phoned it in .
i see .
you 're a poor little rich girl .
your dad taught you everything .
i mean my father .
it takes a real man to be a dad .
it 's all so complicated .
it 's incredibly simple .
eventually you 'll let go .
you 're amazing .
your audience is way ahead of you .
in a word : merk . exposed .
besides , merk 's a boy scout .
that 's probably my office .
well ? where the hell are you ?
shoes are my thing .
that 's refreshingly deviant .
what about you ?
i 'm very aural .
tell me more .
a portuguese boyfriend . sounds very `` cosmo . ''
do you trust me , julie ?
not a chance .
come on .
i want you to trust me .
that 's hard to believe .
it bothers me , profoundly .
you 're quick . i like that .
you think you 're working with chimps here ?
i was afraid i 'd never see you again .
five years from now . what 's happening ?
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
yellow pages ?
dare i ask for this dance ?
that 's part of growing up , honey .
you boys could make it a little adventure .
i 'm not in siberia , you know .
are they taking good care of you ?
i do n't even know where to begin .
well ? surprised ?
when are you coming home ?
oh , good lord . are those neptunes ?
only the best for my mother .
you promise you 'll finish school ?
oh . goodness .
you can do anything you ever wanted to do !
like what ?
but who would run the store ?
can you ever forgive me ?
i 'm really in deep shit .
i liked you before you were filthy rich .
thanks , principal merkin .
i know you can take it .
i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
a very good start .
it 's every red-blooded , heterosexual male 's dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
rules are rules .
come on , it 's our only senior prom .
i 'm warning you .
do n't rain on our parade .
then you break the law .
you called the cops on us ?
please ?
uh , sure . uncle billy .
you do like girls , do n't you ?
of course i like girls .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?
as much as possible .
which is seldom .
we do n't allow tipn , ted .
there you are , ted-baby . everything all right ?
everybody 's dying to meet you .
truth is , i 'm a little nervous .
nervous ? why on earth should you be nervous ?
it 's a lot of pressure .
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i do ?
you . ted . are the king of coitus .
me ? the king of coitus ?
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .
i 've never even actually ...
i told you you could do it .
i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .
i never struggled for a second .
never had the guts .
you think we should be more open minded ?
imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .
do n't forget to tell them all your qualifications .
some of them have real angel potential .
my father must 've been amazing .
i ca n't wait to see the pictures .
our first issue together is almost ready to print .
thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .
what are you doing ?
what makes a family is love , not blood .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
in a hurry , are we ?
bad news .
people pay good money for that ?
my parents ? what do you mean ?
the amazon . piranhas . it was n't pretty .
how quaint .
are you familiar with `` heaven ? ''
i know it like the back of my hand .
talk to me artie .
kelly van ryan ...
apparently i 'm the last to know ...
she 's pushing for suspension ...
how you doing , artie ?
is that sandra van ryan 's kid ?
kelly .
she 's going to wash your jeep ?
you look pretty .
and where might that be ?
i was thinking , antigua , maybe .
maybe i 'll come visit you .
how soon can we get something ?
merritt , forensics .
the teeth doin ' any talkin ' ?
i told you the dental records will take time ...
what about the blood ?
she still work there ?
that came with her .
was n't exactly a love child ...
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters .
you okay ?
i just want to forget it .
his fingers ... his fingers ...
take your time .
both places ... you know .
did he put himself inside you ?
he hurt me ...
did you try to fight him ?
i remember my hands were cold . '
then he just stopped .
you mean he withdrew ...
it 's hard to remember , exactly .
try , kelly .
i 'll see you get a proper tour .
did you call the masons ?
no .
how long ?
maybe she used another name .
i do n't know what to say ...
i 've got that two o'clock in town .
her word against his .
nothing works . they do n't die .
the skinny brunette .
it 's a pretty dismal place .
you saw the news today ?
unless ...
surely her father ...
eliminate the competition .
guess i kind of lost it there .
this is how it begins ...
if you want company ...
those are suzie toller 's teeth .
poor dumb suzie , she never had a chance .
will you do me one favor ?
ray , you heard him ...
i need you ...
i 'm going home .
where 's lombardo ?
and i do n't give a shit .
that bothers you ?
yeah , maybe , a little .
about a year ago .
he dropped jimmy off first ?
no .
so you were alone .
yes .
did he come in with you ?
he did say something .
why ?
ran away ...
where 's this coming from ?
i want a full-scale investigation .
you know what that will mean for lombardo .
that 's bullshit .
what about witnesses ?
are you crazy , ray ?
and you saw the girls ...
kelly 's next , gloria .
she bit you ?
we stood up together .
you did n't cuff her ?
the teeth , were they ...
you guess ? did he or did n't he ?
yeah ... okay ... he did
did you maybe flirt a little ...
suzie ! did this man rape you ?
i could n't stop him ... it hurt .
ms. toller ?
i said he did .
this was n't my idea .
now they 're gon na get screwed .

it 's those rocks , up there .
you and suzie used to come out here together ?
you really think something bad happened to suzie ?
i say something funny ?

what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm scared there 's no one to trust .
oh , for christ 's sake .
what are you looking at ?
i thought we were goin ' to a movie .
i wan na live at the beach someday .
is there some reason why you 're here ?
curiosity , i guess .
that 's murder , kelly .

i would hardly say you look like trash .

listen to me as you never listened before .
are they going to kill you ?
and stay there !
what are you going to do ?

the commissioner 's getting very uneasy .
how 'bout that .
what's-her-name moved to buffalo .
who else knows ?
people from outside the department .
what 's your first move ?
who else knows ?
you should n't have taken elton out .
we figured pretty bad .
that 's what i called to tell you .
johnny 
you might want to pass it along to mac .
it 's all over , paul .
what 's his name ?
where are you taking us ?
you have no right to keep us here .
i meet a lot of people like that .
what was that ?
whacking ?
they do n't seem to like you very much .
they kid a lot .
but not a good tired .
your sister said you do n't have a family ?
oh ? anything else ?
i want to go home .
where are you taking us now ?

only the elders .
how long ?
what ?
how long have i been here ?
two days .
but i 've got to go .
tell him his tea stinks .
the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
enjoying your reading ?
what 's that ?
your husband 's ?
see ? hooks and eyes .
something wrong with buttons ?
buttons are hochmut .
hochmut ?
he is not plain .
anything against zippers ?
they seem to think we are quaint .
where 's the nearest telephone ?
i 'm going this morning .
but stoltzfus said ...
i know what he said .
the ... bullets ?
oh ? what happened to hochstetler ?
we had some lemonade and he left .
what else can you do ?
i 'm hell at whacking .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .
sure .
but ... you may not be well enough .
when will you be going ?
won him over just like that .
if you 're leaving tomorrow .
i know .
i was being foolish ?
even thinking about living this life .
you 're so sure of that ?
just as i could live yours !
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
no woman ! no children ! no land !
which is a sin against heaven !
that 's your way , not mine .
where 's my baggy pants ?
anybody know about this ?
i did n't even know about it .
i got there late , john .
you did n't let anybody down . it happens 
tonight .
what 's happening .
i 'll call you when i can .
johnny , what the fuck ?

how hot am i ?
do n't do it . do n't come in .
i 'm coming .
you hear me ?
i hear you . i 'll stay in touch .
where i 'm at is maybe 1890 .

you know where he is .
wrong .
you 'd lie to protect him .
you admit you 're lying ?
i admit i do n't know where he is .
you 're the first one he 'll contact .
tell me what you know ...
did you find him ?
he overstated the department 's position .
i do n't know where he is .
everything okay ?
yes , thank you very much .
john said you 're amish .
yes .
good morning .
you did n't have to ...
he 's so ... agaanisish !
what 's so funny ?
the way he looked when you screamed at him .
no ? why not ?
who was that man ?
is the english dead ?
no ...
that has no place in this house .
they 'll say we broke their laws 
as well as being a fine policeman .
is this plain ? is this the ordnung ?
i have done nothing against the ordnung .
and you call this nothing ?
i have committed no sin .
about having you ... shunned !
that is idle talk .
i am not a child .
you are acting like one !
i will be the judge of that .
and so will i ... if you shame me !
no , rachel ...
never seen anything like that in all my years .
he ... will be repentant .
you 're rachel lapp , are n't you ?

no jokes , ive heard them all .
what happened to len tashka ?
couldnt make it . splitting headache .
theres no davidov at miratom .
so who are you ?
we can track the bomb .
the plutonium is missing . theyve taken the core !
then its no longer a bomb ?
you nearly killed us !
and she thinks she got away with it .
what the hell are you talking about ?
the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
whos she ?
elektra king .
are you insane ? this is her pipeline .
makes her look even more innocent .
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
what is it ?
nuclear .
the king pipeline .
is there another way ?
hes sealed himself in .
do you know what youre doing ?
what kind of bikes did you ride ?
but what if ...
weve got to get out .
i love christmas in turkey .
its just a scratch .
then maybe id be ... open to that .
perhaps after this ... test ?
... yes ? ...
constructions not exactly my line .
old friend ?
hes a man of great integrity .
im not sure she knows what shes walking into .
ive scheduled a medical for you .
what do you know of the caspian sea ?
hitler wanted it . stalin beat him to it .
who told you to look at elektras files ?
i took the initiative .
you havent been given an assignment in this case .
he wants us to know hes back .
who ?
claude serrault . a.k.a ...
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
now robert is dead . he got his revenge .
the inside man ?
who did you get it from ?
your last chance . take the money .
the name ?
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty .
who is it ?
you will never get near her .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
so distressing for m. an explosion inside her lair .
shell get over it .
in case youve forgotten . im dead already .
beautiful , isnt it ?
im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover .
he was my father .
im sorry .
i met you at my fathers funeral .
funerals arent exactly memorable .
im not sure he knew that .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
who is he ?
and he makes an excellent omelette .
how long has he been with you ?
does this look familiar to you ?
or is it just your way with women ?
especially kings daughter .
gabor will drive you back .
oh my god ... were buried alive ...
i cant stay here .
no ! it will cave in !
i cant stay .
what is it ?
james ...
i have to go .
then take me with you .
no . youll be safe here .
i dont want to be safe !
vodka martini .
surely you believe in living dangerously .
you knew it would be like this .
how did you survive ?
whats wrong with you ? are you crazy ?
isnt that your motto ?
... what ?
you can drop the act , its over .
i dont know what youre talking about !
he used your exact words .
i could have given you the world .
wheres m ?
all this , because you fell for renard ?
you turned renard .
so you killed your father .

one ... last ... screw ?
valentin zukovsky .
bondjamesbond . what brings you here ?
you , of course . i need some information .
a nice little rats nest .
everyone does what they can to survive .
how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?
trying to impress this innocent thing ?
shes no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .
whats your business with elektra king ?
that is 5,000 dollars of beluga ruined !
now ... where were we ?
a rope !
sometimes i smuggle machinery for her . russian stuff .
and the payoff on the tables ?
wheres the sub going ? !
no ! get me out !
where is it ?
just you , me and my people .
where ?
the maidens tower .
what ?
no ! bond !
what is this place ?
but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo .
what class sub does your nephew run ?
ill send someone out .
perhaps this isnt the time ...
your father ...
someone will come .
warm .
so beautiful . so smooth , so warm .
because bond is dead ? its what you wanted .
he was a ... good lover ?
this is the end .
everythings under control up here . are you ready ?
not just elaborate . cock-sure .

iran , iraq , pakistan , syria , afghanistan ...
the parcels in the post .
