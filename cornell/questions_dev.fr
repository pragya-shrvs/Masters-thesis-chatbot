i 'm going to get it right this time .
the sick boy method .
yeah , well , it surely worked for him .
he 's always been lacking in moral fibre .
he knows a lot about sean connery .

to see you through the night that lies ahead .
your favourite dish .
excellent .
your usual table , sir ?

but where ?
i do n't know , tommy .
i love people . all people .
homeless people ?

with a starship !
then i shall make use of this starship .
it will be your chariot !
you doubt me ?
he doubts me .
bring me the ship or i will destroy you !
the ship ... .
my pain ?
it runs deep . share it with me .
rescued at last .

is there a problem , gentlemen ?
sulu ! look ! the sun 's come out !

the power was within you .
join my quest .
what is it you seek ?

a starship ?

i can not be certain .
but he does seem familiar ?
who is it he reminds you of ?
what do you mean ?

to land any closer would risk detection .
mr. sulu . execute .
yes , captain ?
be one with the horse .

if you think it would help .
you ordered me to kill my brother .

sybok , listen to me .
i 'll take you to the bridge .
i 'm afraid of nothing .
i 've done nothing .
now learn something about yourself .
no . i refuse .
given to me by god .

no . i will not .
you know i 'm right .
i hide no pain .
i know you better than that .

i can not go with you .

i defy any and all limits .
seriously , it 's like we 're being reborn .
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
and nobody knows you 're a virgin !
well , dad said ...

our plane crashed . in the grand canyon .
it 's a lot to digest .
i 'd feel like staying up all night !
take a whiff of heaven .

sorry .
you 'll never believe who 's in there .
it better not be my aunt trudy .
chicks are like buses .
no , leave one .
brilliant !
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty .
except the girl .
oh , god . look . look .
we reinvented ourselves .
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man .
jealousy is so unattractive .
he kicked major ass and you know it .
you go first .
ladies first . i insist .
well . the prom 's coming up .
yeah ?
and i was wondering .
yeah ?
if you do n't have ... i mean ...
you like me . i like you .
i do n't like you .
but that smile .
oh , ted , duh .
so that 's a maybe ?
the answer is never , ted , never .
yeah ? you like ?
makes your shoulders look so big and broad .
christy ?
i turned eighteen over spring break .
do it ?
you know ... take the pictures ?
which you pulled , hard !
that was code for `` i like you . ''
you have changed since second grade .
i mean , what do you think ?
maybe on the outside .
of course , dumpling .
i always wanted craftsman tools .
oh , honey .
we love our lives just the way they are .
we miss you . we miss our son .
we miss our family .
dad , please .
grandpa was so strong back then .
it was the year of the rhizopus rot .
i 'm getting so good at this .
of course we are .
they did n't want me when i was born .
well , why should i ?
they had a rough life .
i guess .
they did do one great thing .
yeah .
be a sport .
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
... not the pit .
just say it , dad .
well , good . every little bit helps .
we 're grateful , ted .
it 's okay . you need me ?
your mom said you 've been ignoring your chores .
you ordered a winnebago ?
i will not have my boys arguing .
they 're in the ignition , silly .
got it .
it 's your car .
some of them have to be automatics .
your father liked shifting .
i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
the one with the horses .
that 's me .
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
do n't worry . he found the chocolate room .
hi ho , silver .
what do you mean ? i 'm ted nelson .
and who is ted nelson ?
i always knew there was more .
hmmm ?
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ?
whatever you want .
what do you want me to do ?
this is humiliating .
hang in there , i 'll think of something .
so here we are . dead .
everything .
i 'm helen mcdole .
we 'll send you the release forms , ted .
they kept this scrapbook of your life .
are they hitting you up for donations ?
what about the future ?
you can call me jimmy again .
most places are , jimmy .
my new bike .
very funny .
better view , more spacious , new carpet .
it 's not up to me .
mom and dad said it 's yours .
you can have it , then .
you want it in writing ?
just a formality .
are you kidding ?
you ca n't come back .
funny you should say that .
i meant biologically .
that 's a crappy thing to say .
look ted . i 'm cool with everything .
i did n't forget .
look , i loved `` exposed ! ''
go ahead . ask her to the prom .
i have absolutely no intention --
-- do it . i triple-dog-dare you .
but you triple-dog-dared me .
your article sucked .
in what sense ?
i 'm still better than you .
me ?
`` local boy inherits more money than god . ''
really ? you wan na write about me ?
i do n't get the distinction .
i see .
interesting .
you never know around here .
funny you should say `` peachy . ''
i did my homework .
my adoptive grandfather .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
why ca n't you be nice to me ?
you 've got enough people kissing your ass .
to the best hiding place in the world .
whatever .
not `` whatever . ''
he cared enough to want you to have it .
he phoned it in .
i see .
i doubt it .
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted .
i mean my father .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted .
it 's all so complicated .
it 's incredibly simple .
i feel like i 'm being drawn and quartered .
and then what ?
i know .
in a word : merk . exposed .
that 's two words .
there 's got ta be something .
well ? where the hell are you ?
he 's on the move ?
wearing them ? or humping them ?
what about you ?
i 'm very aural .
tell me more .
sounds , voices , music , humming .
you live and learn .
not a chance .
come on .
trust is something you earn , over time .
maybe someday .
but absolutely true .
aw julie , it 's my job .
you think you 're working with chimps here ?
the thing is , i made a commitment .
i 'm not going anywhere , ted .
i graduated from college .
yellow pages ?
let your fingers do the walking .
you better .
what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?
charlie , at a will reading ?
did you have a nice flight ?
yeah , i 'm doing fine .
save it , honey .
what is all this ?
just a few tokens of my affection .
only the best for my mother .
you promise you 'll finish school ?
i 'll make you very proud .
you 're free .
like what ?
like take that trip to buckingham palace .
forget the store . think big .
oh , teddy . we missed you so much .

thanks , principal merkin .
i 'll be blunt .
yes , sir . i 'll brace myself .
that 's a good start , yes .
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
what kind of sick question is that ?
come on , it 's our only senior prom .
deaf ears , mr. nelson .
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ?
mr. nelson , you disappoint me .
what law , merk ? having fun ?
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
uh , sure . uncle billy .
i have only one concern ...
of course i like girls .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?
as much as possible .
you 're sure ?
seldom ? no kidding ?
tipping ?
yeah . everything 's cool .
just a couple of finishing touches .
you ? nervous ?
all those people out there .
huh ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i do ?
you are a multi-media magnate .
me ? the king of coitus ?
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .
whoa . but ... that 's the thing ...
why , look who 's here .
i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .
i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
my parents always say hard work builds character .
what kind of ideas ?
the world is a big , beautiful place .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
i 'm ted nelson .
really ? so i 'm doing ok ?
he was in a league of his own .
it was incredible .
thanks , uncle billy . thanks for everything .
you 're a great kid .
my job . back off , benedict .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that 's right .
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit .

you 've got the wrong guy .
it 's spring break .
i 'm seventeen .
your fathered owned the entire `` heaven '' empire .

elektra king .
elektra king ? are you insane ?
makes her look even more innocent .
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
she just upped the stakes .
not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor .
elektra would control it all .
we go down to the torpedo bay .
hes going to insert the plutonium .
like riding a bike .
just wanted to put him on edge ...
count to twenty . ill be there .
we cant .
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ?
james . it wouldnt really be ...
perhaps after this ... test ?
... yes ? ...
i could come for a second opinion ?
quite the opposite , in fact .
since oxford .
who buys classified reports for three million pounds .
shes not a girl anymore .
its barely a scratch .
caviar capital of the world . matchless beluga .
and now its up for grabs , a goldrush .
i took the initiative .
you havent been given an assignment in this case .
i was the one who brought that money in ...
who ?
claude serrault . a.k.a ...
renard .
how many deaths is he responsible for ?
now robert is dead . he got his revenge .
hes not through yet .
is maybe ... the inside woman .
i am just a middle man .
your last chance . give me the name .
i cant tell you ... alright , alright !
indeed .
you think i fear death ? i welcome it .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
consider me ungrateful .
shell get over it .
you even brought the plane for us .
havent you heard the news ? so is she .
yes .
you knew him well ?
im sorry .
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream .
yes .
god no .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
partially , yes .
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere .
how long has he been with you ?
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
its my fathers pin .
its not the pin your father wore .
you are wrong , mr . bond .
always wanted to see the upper lines .
were alright .
youre not going to .
its the only way out ...
i know .
... you should rest .
i have to go .
then take me with you .
no . youll be safe here .
i dont want to be safe !
i have to go to work .
two . shaken not stirred .
not at that price . time to surrender .
shush .
i used my body on the guards .
a little . does it matter ?
what are you talking about ?
we had a run-in , he and i .
i dont know what youre talking about !
i think you do .
you knew .
not interested .
soon shell be everywhere .
five more turns and your neck will break .
just like you ... only you were even easier .
he killed me !
it is my oil ! mine and my familys !
elektra , its not too late .

i thought you were the one in her business .
you are out of your league .
a rope !
no . the truth !
and the payoff on the tables ?
a special job .
