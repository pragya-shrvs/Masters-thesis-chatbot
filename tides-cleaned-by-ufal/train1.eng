the other areas are rangat and great nicobar .
most of the activities of the tamilians are centred around port blair , where they have a beautiful community hall where functions are held .
they also bring out a number of tamil weekly newspapers .
they are a hard - working people and most of them work as labourers .
tamil films are also shown in the local cinema halls .
there are quite a large number of malayalees living here .
the vegetation and climate of these islands are very much similar to those of kerala .
they are spread out throughout the islands .
in south andaman some families were settled at mai tilak which is in close proximity to the jarawa reserve .
the cellular jail has been called the university of the independence struggle .
is found in the west coast of great nicobar called the magapod island .
a unique feature of this bird is that it changes its colour and just mingles with the background of the land .
the pied imperial pigeon is creamy white with jet black flying feathers at the tip of his tail .
the colonial system of administration was maintained .
the chief commissioner continued to enjoy the supreme powers in respect of the islands .
in fact , most of the members were nominated and were generally ' yes ' men of the chief commissioner .
played a vital role in educating the political leadership .
the congress party has always remained the dominant party in these islands .
being a centrally administrated area it could hardly afford to be out of tune with delhi .
k . r . ganesh , former minister , took active interest in organising the congress party in these islands .
almost all the national parties and some of the regional parties have their branches in these islands .
the political history of the nicobar group of islands reveals the true character of the european countries during the 18th and 19th centuries .
the invention of gun powder had equipped them with a lethal weapon which the east could not match .
first they sent the missionaries and then came the doctor , followed by an invasion by the soldiers .
in some cases the missionaries themselves were given all the functions .
this pattern is quite evident in the political history of the nicobar islands .
the nicobar group of islands is mentioned in the writings of old travellers .
plotemy calls them ' nagadip ' , a hindu name for naked island .
however , there is an authentic record that it was actually ' no karam ' , a name given by an indian king , which ultimately became nicobar .
according to this inscription chola king rajendra ii conquered the nicobar group of islands during an overseas expedition led by him in the beginning of the llth century .
marco polo mentioned them as ' necaveram ' .
during the 13th century these islands , which were called ' nakaaram ' by indians became current by this name among the arabs and europeans also .
friar odoric who visited these islands in 1322 also mentions them as ' nicoveram ' .
in the 15th and 16th centuries the portuguese referred to them as ' nacubar ' and ' nicobar ' .
but he returned to pondicherry in 1742 where he died .
at the same time attention of the danish east india company also turned towards car nicobar .
a plan for its colonisation was made and an expedition started from tranquebar in 1755 .
all members of the danish east india company died of fever .
the guns left by the danish east india company in nancowry were gradually stolen away by the malays .
even during the stay of the missionaries at car nicobar a dutch adventurist named william bolt hoisted the austrian flag on nicobar .
his companion baunet occupied nancowry , car nicobar , tringuest and katchal in april 1778 .
bolt ' s action was an adventure similar to those undertaken by many europeans in those days .
bolt ' s action seems to have offended the danes .
in order to maintain danish rights over these islands it was resolved to establish a new settlement .
the crown took over the rights and administration of the nicobar islands from the east india company in 1783 .
however , no settlement could be established by the danes in the nicobar islands in accordance with the decision of the danish government .
in 1807 the english , on account of the napoleanic wars , announced the possession of these islands in the name of great britain .
however , their nominal possession ended in 1814 when , at the conclusion of the war , these islands were returned to the danes .
in the meantime , the french also tried to occupy these islands but failed .
finally in 1845 the danes made the last attempt to occupy these islands .
buse was sent by the government and he appointed two persons for hoisting their flag .
from 1848 to 1869 the islands were left to themselves .
the infighting among the europeans over these islands made the nicobarese very angry .
nicobarese became notorious throughout the indian ocean as being little better than pirates .
several incidents of attacks on the crew of ships anchoring off nicobars were reported during this period .
in 1843 a small craft coming from bengal was cut off at the same spot and the entire crew of 25 was killed .
in 1852 british vessels were the victim of piracy on the coast of nicobar islands in which entire crew was killed .
in 1867 , a rig named ' fatteh islam ' was attacked at the island of trinket and 21 persons were killed .
therefore , they could do little to administer these islands and had to contend with the nominal control over them .
the captains , who wielded the real authority , agreed to hoist the british flag whenever foreign ships visited the harbour .
thus the islands were loosely administered by undertaking a few excursions after a couple of months .
after bishop richardson returned to the scene after receiving education at rangoon , things started looking up .
a post of assistant commissioner at car nicobar was created .
the last incumbent of the british regime before japanese occupation was scot .
presently the tribals of the nicobar group of islands are still far from politics .
it is time we now looked back and delved into the affairs and lives of the primitive tribes of the islands .
the jarawas , a primitive tribe , which the anthropologists put in negrito stock , live mainly in the different islands of south andaman and middle andaman .
they continue to enjoy a free , independent and nomadic life .
their main source of living is sea food , fish , wild pig , tuber crops and honey .
they roam about the jungles quite naked , in search of food and are excellent swimmers .
some of the contractors officially requisition the services of the bush police for their protection .
it is believed that quite a number of jarawas are killed by the bush police in the process .
roughly their number is estimated at between 100 and 200 .
a group of four bengali poachers entered their area for collection of seashells etc .
he escaped their wrath and swam across to another island where
there is no evidence to this effect , and no such instance of cannibalism has even been recorded in the recent history of the andamans .
i accepted the challenge and volunteered to lead the expedition into jarawa territory .
what were the gifts to be given to them in case they show friendly feeling ?
what route is to be taken ?
we sailed from port blair in the night in the milali boat specially designed for the service of the primitive tribals .
in the early hours we reached strait island , a settlement of the andamani tribe , and attached a dinghy to milali for the purpose of landing .
we then left the open sea in the east coast and entered a small channel joining it to the west coast .
every one of us was cautious and was looking attentively towards the coast .
all eyes turned towards these objects and , as milali advanced further , the objects became more clear and took the shape of human figures .
to our great surprise they indeed were the jarawas .
there was a feeling of joy and fear among those on board .
would they run away or attack or welcome us ?
* as milali went nearer we saw the jarawas running in the direction of milali towards their huts .
apparently they came to the conclusion that we meant no harm to them .
they seemed to be extremely happy and were making friendly gestures .
on reaching milali they were greatly excited and started running , jumping and shouting all over the vessel .
they were very fond of steel items , as they needed them for their bows and arrows .
as a precautionary measure all the cabin doors of milali were kept shut , just to keep them safe from any mischief by the jarawas .
we had locked the gifts of coconut , bananas etc , in a room separated by a wire gauge .
suddenly , much to our discomfort the velocity of the wind increased , the gale turned into a storm and we realised that we were trapped in a cyclone .
the waves were sky high and small milali was tossing around like a shuttlecock .
the waves were crashing with such speed that the boat was making great sound and water was entering into the cabin .
it was quite difficult either to lie or sit or stand .
he writes that the behaviour of the onges was quite friendly and womenfolk came to the ship without fear or hesitation .
they were shown calcutta city .
they were greatly excited to see the city , people and transport .
equally surprised were they to see the shops , circus , museum etc .
the people of calcutta were also thrilled to see these tribals .
huge crowds came to see them .
the shopkeepers showed them their wares with great enthusiasm .
the visit was intended to stimulate their thinking for material advancement .
for many years unsuccessful attempts have been made to bring them into the mainstream of national life .
the obvious result therefore is that the birth rate comes down .
as pointed out earlier , in this hot climate the onges do not like to put on clothes .
the amount of money that is being spent on the onges , considering their small number , should be sufficient to keep them in a five star hotel .
however , most of the money is lost in red tapism and the last man gets very little .
near the south andaman ' s western coast there is an island called north sentinel island .
however , it is all a wild conjecture .
the andamanese had to submit to the authority of the british who used some of them for keeping a watch on the convicts of the penal settlement .
it is a matter of satisfaction that , during the recent years , some action has been taken in this direction .
this news had a lightening effect in the entire jail and all the freedom fighters felt very proud and happy .
a major breakthrough has been achieved by some groups of shompens who have come out from their shell of shyness and hesitation .
an interesting feature is the tremendous interest evinced by tourists from all over the world .

this is the sub - divisional headquarter of the middle andaman and has a hospital , schools and other offices .
it is 85 nautical miles from port blair and there is a direct as well as via rangat ferry service .
one can disembark at rangat and from there take a bus to mayabunder .

the two cinque islands are separated only by a sand bar which gets submerged during the high tide .
little further south there are two pairs of islands known as brother and sister islands .
the onges have now settled at dengong creek a few kilometres away from hut bay towards the north .
the settlement can be visited for academic reasons with permission from the local administration .
however , one can always find a couple of onges at hut bay itself where they frequently go for purchases .
the visitor must climb up the stairs to peep inside to see the cosy atmosphere and air passing through cane flooring , an improvised method of air - conditioning .
the people in general are quite friendly and hospitable .
the nicobarese play all types of indoor and outdoor games .
the nicobarese are very fond of cultural programmes and are very talented .
chaura is flat almost like a football field .
the rubber trees have come up with excellent growth and the yield will be a great asset to the country ' s economy .
great nicobar campbell bay , the headquarters of great nicobar island , is 294 nautical miles from port blair .
this is the biggest island in the nicobar group with high hills and big rivers like alexandria and galatea .
the island originally was inhabitated by the extremely shy and non - violent primitive tribes , the shompens , and there were few nicobari habitations on the west coast .
after india became independent a pilot project was started , bringing 100 ex - servicemen families from punjab for rehabilitation .
a meeting with the shampens can also be arranged .
on the western coast there is a small island of magapod , where the rare bird magapod is found .

bose was very keen to meet prime minister tojo but the latter was reluctant to do so .
he was quite discourteous to him and gave him time for a meeting as late as 10 june 1943 .
but in the very first meeting bose caste such a spell on this little dangerous man that it had an electrifying effect .
tojo was so impressed by the analysis of events given by bose that he sought another meeting with him to consider the proposal .
subhas chandra bose reached singapore on 2 july 1943 .
he got such an unprecedented , tumultuous ovation that it appeared as if lion - city had gone wild .
for over two weeks there were celebrations in the city which had a festive air .
bose was touched by this spontaneous overflow of love and affection .
had japan handed over these islands to netaji and diverted its forces on the burma front , the story perhaps would have been different .
japan had recently appeared on the scene of advanced nations and had no past experience of colonial administration .
in this respect they were far behind the british who had specialised this art .
, was hailed and held in high esteem , the people of the andamans shuddered at this nightmare , which made their life most unhappy and sad .
it was for this reason that the japanese did not make it their headquarters .
the next day netaji visited the cellular jail .
the japanese deliberately kept him away from the wing where hundreds of the so - called second spy case victims were kept .
on the last day of his visit a public meeting was also arranged in the gymkhana maidan in which a large number of people came .
netaji came from ross island to maidan in a ceremonious procession of a fleet of vehicles flanked by japanese officers .
on arrival netaji went up the rostrum and unfurled the tricolour flag .
netaji renamed the andaman and nicobar islands as ' shaheed dweep ' ( martyr ) and ' swarajya deep ' ( freedom ) .
he had to live on the human flesh of the dead bodies which floated to the shore .
after a week another operation known as ' round up ' took place .

the education department of the islands has seen many ups and downs during the post - independence period .
in the initial period , the education department continued to be guided by the rangoon education department for some years .
due to the partition of the country a sizeable population of the refugees from east bengal ( bangladesh ) were rehabilitated in these islands .
this gave rise to the need for imparting education in bengali and primary schools on the pattern of west bengal were established under the west bengal education department .
during the time of the british , most of the activities of the administration remained confined only to port blair and areas around south andaman .
during the japanese occupation , the road construction programme received some attention .
it was only after independence that a planned development of road network was spread all over the andaman and nicobar islands .
one of the reasons for this was that these islands had been chosen for the rehabilitation of people under different schemes .
many new islands came under habitation for the first time and needed necessary infrastructure for development .
one of the major road projects taken up was the ' andaman grand trunk road ' .
in the whole of bengal there was a strong wave for armed revolution .

on 1 january 1915 the fifth indian regiment raised the banner of revolt .
, were incarcerated in the cellular jain in 1916 .
in the absence of a clear - cut policy about their adjustment to the modern world they are fast losing their identity .
the entire population is now fully dependent on the administration for their daily needs .
they do not wear any clothes as such .
obviously , the administration could not accede to such demands .
the onges mostly are now living in a tribal settlement colony at degong creek .
most of them are very weak and some of them suffer from diseases like tuberculosis .

on 22 september 1937 the first batch of the freedom fight - ers set sail for the mainland .
the strong fortification all around the seashore , specially the strong pill boxes which are like monuments left by a nation determined to march ahead .
the hard work and dedication of the japanese was the secret of their progress as a great nation .
it was personally a great shock to churchill , since he never expected an asian power to achieve such a phenomenal success .
rarely have the vanquished helped win so much .
n . a which became a bone of contention between mohan singh and the japanese authorities .
mohan singh was not allowed to form another division and even the one division formed was not given adequate supplies and other provisions .
there were also some differences between mohan singh and ras behari bose .
as many of them preferred to go back as pows and some of them were sent there by the japanese .
the intelligence report gathered by colonel iwakuro revealed that subhas chandra bose alone could control the situation .
they were pleasantly surprised when ras behari bose not only agreed to step down but also offered to give every assistance to subhas chandra bose .
it was under these circumstances that subhas chandra bose was urgently summoned to south east asia .
the government was highly perturbed by his activities .
in his reply the chief secretary admitted that arrangements for the journey from pune to thane were not proper .
andaman and nicobar islands were the forward air bases of japan which posed a direct threat to ceylon and india .
from this base the japanese carried out successful air raids to calcutta .
initially , the british tried to cultivate subhas and soften his edges and invited him to england .
their empire was shaking to its foundation , and they had no resources left to face the advance of japan .
america after its humiliating defeat at pearl harbour was itching to take revenge .
the british had the brain and planning while america had immense resources , and they both agreed to pool these together .
when they resorted to typical mughal court intrigues which they had mastered during their stay in india .
some of the indian officials who had served in the islands were also used for helping in processing the intelligence reports .
since a sizeable population of the islands consisted of people from south india , the agents were recruited in madras , vishakhapatnam and kerala .
after extensive training they were dropped at strategic locations by the submarines .
he attached great importance to cellular jail and the andamans .
the date 15 august was of special significance in the life of mountbatten .
it seems that there was some deliberate move to induct mountbatten in the affairs of india for a long time .
from the above it is clear that lack of arrangements for solitary confinement in the andamans has caused im - mense problems .
during this time bal gangadhar tilak ' s revolutionary paper kesari was spreading the message of the revolution .
the congress activities were also increasing day by day .
by this time the penal settlement had also been ex - tended considerably .
it is possible that wavell was asked by mountbatten to make his independent assessment about the future of the islands .
majid was the first indian ever to be appointed to that post .
the andaman islands are a chief commissioner ' s province and are , therefore , administered by the central government .
if there were an independent bengal a decision is needed whether andamans should go with bengal or with hindustan .
it is true that we are contemplating the transfer of power on the basis of dominion status as an interim measure .
the practice is likely to end with the direct participation of the nicobarese in the administration .
the car nicobar and other islands around it have been declared as tribal areas and entry of outsiders is regulated through permit .
the nicobarese have absolute unalienable right to the tribal land , which is exercised by the chief captain .
the government has also to approach the chief captain for the purchase of land whenever they stand in need for it .
the captain readily agreed .
since the islands were in their infancy so far as development was concerned and there was no infrastructure for the implementation of plans .
the islands were awarded the president ' s shield by the government of india for increasing the production of paddy by 15 per cent .
it is gratifying that the administration has taken up some positive steps in the direction of improving the breed of the milch animals .
for this purpose a cross - breed cattle ( holding ) farm has been established at dollygunj .
new scientific techniques for improving the breed of the livestock seem to have come as a great boon to these inaccessible far - off islands .
preservation of semen for artificial insemination was a big problem in these islands .
with the latest technology , frozen semen can now be preserved in liquid nitrogen forever .
towards the end of the nineteenth century bengal had taken over the lead of the freedom movement .
surendra nath banerjee undertook a tour of india during 1877 - 78
till the end of 1905 , in bengali alone 65 such periodicals which were full of patriotic feelings and which unequivocally condemned the alien rule were published .
at the same time swami vivekananda , with his superb discourses on the hindu religion , had instilled feelings of catholicity and brother - hood among the people .
there were many restrictions imposed upon the students ' activities and publication of periodicals etc .
in january 1908 arvind ghosh wrote that national - ism cannot be suppressed as it is immortal .
it is immortal because it is not man made . '
today god himself is work - ing in the shape of nationalism .
god can neither be killed nor be silenced by putting in jail ' .
in the absence of training facilities in the islands , they were sent to the mainland .
since the large number of teachers could not be accommodated at one place , they had to be distributed to different states .
in the andaman group of islands the main centre of business activities is port blair .
most of the important business concerns in the country have had their branches opened here .
wheat and 3,988 m . t .
the administration has the facility of police wireless which helps in contacting the government of india on urgent matters .
lt also has a network of wireless stations throughout the islands which keeps it informed of the day - to - day events .
press and information
the population of the locals went on increasing in south andaman , particularly in port blair and the villages around it .
thus people forgot all about their caste and religion .
hence most of the customs adopted by this new class of people with regard to holi , diwali and even marriage resembled the customs prevalent in uttar pradesh .
similarly , the language adopted was simple hindustani .
with which they communicate in this language .
there are many illustrious people who have come up from the local born families .
k . r . ganesh , former minister , belongs to this class .
his father ratnam was a well reputed businessman and there is a market named after him which is called ratnam market .
it is heartening to note that religion is treated as a personal matter of belief .
thus a hindu girl marrying a muslim boy or a muslim girl marrying a hindu boy is a normal phenomenon in these islands .
many social - cum - religious organisations have also been established in these islands .
the swami vivekanand memorial society has opened an educational institution at port blair which also organises seminars and debates .
the chinmayanand mission runs a similar institution at port blair .
there is also a school run by the anand margis .
the bahai association has worked in these islands for many years .
there is a substantial population of christians at port blair , belonging to both the roman catholic and the methodist churches .
they have their beautiful churches and run many educational and charitable organisations , including one prestigious convent school , carmel girls school , which is very popular .
bishop shrinivasan was an institution in these islands , having lived here for quite a long time .
he belonged to the methodist church and was well conversant with these islands .
he died recently .
he narrated to the author an interesting story of a convict boy who , during the british rule , was smuggled out by a missionary out of compassion .
the english missionary who happened to see the lad felt pity for him and , seeing his innocent face , he prevailed upon the authorities to secure his release .
he then left for some unknown destination abroad .
a large number of people from ranchi ( bihar ) have been residing for years in the island of baratang .
most of them are working in the forest department and at other places .
the missionaries have opened a school for them .
the nicobar group of islands has altogether a different story .
there is nothing common between this group and the andaman group so far as people and their life are concerned .
even the history is different .
the french missionaries made fresh attempts to spread christianity from 1836 to 1845 by sending missionaries named supies and galebert from malacca but in vain .
the nicobarese society is a closed one and all these foreign missionaries in all those years failed to make a dent .
the british therefore thought of utilising the services of an indian missionary of south india , vedappan soloman .
soloman was running a mission school at haddo in port blair .
no trace either of the dinghy or the boys could be found .
he wanted to atone for his sin in bringing the boys to port blair and wanted to console the parents by having a school at car nicobar .
the main reason for this is that they are basically not used to hard work and physically they are not strong enough to work for long hours .
they get upset at the slightest inconvenience and the government officials have a difficult task to bring them round .
but , unfortunately , during this period , many people from japan and china also started migrating to these countries .
in 1910 the canadian government declared the imposition of a ban on the immigration of people from asia .
most of the people belonged to punjab .
they were further annoyed at the attitude of the british authorities at delhi and london , who had turned deaf ears to their plight .
many people perforce had to return to india .
the indians who managed to stay in america started organising themselves .
their dynamic leader lala hardayal was an extraordinary person endowed with great talent .
he was elected president of their organisation for which a rich sikh sardar jwala singh made generous contribution .
they purchased some land at san francisco and started publishing a newspaper for the members of the organisa - tion .
the author had the privilege of attending one such feast .
wrestling and boat races are also held and are witnessed by all the villages .
who is believed to have the powers of smelling evil spirits and driving them away .
in this wooden figures with real or mythological animals , birds , fish , crocodiles , or human beings are carved or painted .
these figures are always aggressive and monstrous as they are supposed to scare and drive away the evil spirits .
the nicobarese seriously believe a lot of mythological tales to be true .
they sky was overcast and it was time to bid goodbye to our new friends .
it is , however , quite difficult to answer this question .
for years the issue is being debated upon between anthropologists and social scientists .
the islands did not grow sufficient foodgrains .
the japanese had also to feed the locals besides their own people .
the only means of getting food was through ships .
the allied powers had sunk more than 750 commercial ships by 1944 .
people under suspicion of passing on information to the allies were arrested on the slightest pretext .
news of the japanese surrender reached the islands on 15 august .
there was a change in the general atmosphere and also in the attitude of the japanese .
but the actual proclamation was made to the public by the governor on the 21st .
in the sea all the mines were laid , to prevent any entry of enemy ships .
on arrival and after inspecting the guard of honour , brigadier soloman sat down at a table facing the japanese and read out the instrument of surrender .
the documents were then handed over for signature .
vice - admiral teizo hara signed and affixed his seal first , and lt .
- colonel tazawa , major general tamenove and a staff officer captain shimazaki followed suit .
immediately afterwards the japanese handed over their swords , saluted in turn and marched off toward their cars .
the islands thus changed hands twice without a fight .
some 4,200 convicts who were repatriated to their homes availed of the offer .
six moribund souls were found alive and were brought to port blair .
investigation started about the atrocities of the japanese and their indian collaborators .
it is a different matter that out of fear of the japanese administration people did not come out with the true facts .
these occupational forces had no experience and knowledge of administering a civil area outside japan .
it is possible that he held discussions with the local officers about the future of these islands and also with the viceroy lord wavell .
lord wavell , accompanied by lady wavell , also visited these islands .
this at once brought the islands on the world tourist map and resultantly there was big boom in the tourist traffic .
trade and commerce
the traders come with their original invoices and other particulars of the commodities they have received on a particular ship .
the civil supplies department is the sole procurement agency of local paddy and rice all over the island at the rates prescribed by the government .
the department is also running four departmental stores at kamorta , campbell bay , car nicobar and neil island .
there is growing unemployment among the educated class of people in these islands which , of course , is a matter of great concern to all .
the air thus also helps the administration by providing information about the happenings in the interior .
besides broadcasting its programmes in hindi and english , the air also broadcasts programmes in nicobari , bangla , tamil , telugu , malayalam etc .
the andaman and nicobar group of islands have rightly been called a miniature india , as people from nearly all the states of india have migrated to these islands .
after independence the islands were flooded with hordes of people .
the biggest influx was of the refugees from bangladesh ( east bengal ) who were rehabilitated in the south , middle and north andaman .
others included repatriats from burma , sri lanka .
the main reason of which is the penal settlement where a large number of freedom fighters and convicts came without their families .
many of the employees of the settlement were also without families .
the unhealthy climate , shortage of drinking water and backwardness of the area were some of the factors which deterred people from bringing their families in the initial stages .
this pulp can be preserved for long durations .
besides , they also have yam , pig and chicken .
however , nowadays they are also using rice and other cereals in considerable quantities .
even pig and chicken depend upon coconut .
the nicobarese are very fond of stimulants .
toddy prepared from coconut is drunk on several occasions and now .
the tamil repatriates from sri lanka were also settled in the rubber plantations of katchal and shaitan khari .
some were also settled in little andaman .
quite a high percentage of malayalees work in the government departments ; almost 90 per cent of the stenographers are malayalees .
they have many cultural organisations and many festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm .
the people originally hailing from andhra region mostly live in and around port blair .
some of them are in trade and business .
most of them belong to the poor strata of society .
they have constructed a beautiful cultural hall at port blair .
the people from south india do not have much difficulty in finding food which is to their liking .
there are many people from other regions also .
but with others they communicate in simple hindi .
later , even this formality was dispensed with .
after the assassination of lord mayo , the then viceroy , the administration was decentralised and was placed directly under the chief commissioner , a newly created post .
being a penal settlement , there was no question of transferring authority to the non - official persons or bodies .
the administration of the town of port blair was directly under the deputy commissioner and the non - officials were never associated with the municipal governance .
after independence , in the andaman and nicobar islands no serious attempts were made to decentralise the power and give adequate representation to the people in the administration .
to reciprocate this friendly gesture we set off in the dinghy towards their huts .
as we reached the shore , some jarawa children , perhaps out of fear , ran away towards their huts and some started climbing up the trees like monkeys .
however , seeing their elders smiling at us their confidence was restored and they too joined us .
some men had wrapped barks of trees round their chest , as protection against the piercing arrows .
there we saw very small huts where some pork and honey were stored .
some of the men and women came along with us and some more wanted to come in the dinghy .
the dinghy was sent and more jarawas came to the boat .
one lady , while examining the spectacles of our anthropologist , broke its frame .
some of them showed a lot of acrobatics .
after some time , when their initial excitement was over , gifts were distributed which they accepted with great enthusiasm .
they had a great sense of humour and kept us laughing all the time by their pranks .
one played a subtle joke on the sardarji .
he gave his share to his wife and stood for the second time to claim his share of gifts .
but his mischievous yet innocent laugh failed to befool the sardarji who showed him the place where he had kept his share .
these make this museum quite meaningful and interesting .
there is a small fisheries museum at port blair which gives an idea about the potential of the marine wealth in these islands .
there are about 350 specimen of sea life ; the exhibit of the carcass of a shark is awe inspiring .
sometimes , the local craftsmen also display their items for sale in this emporium .
miniature canoes and palm mats for floors and tables are also available here .
the sawmill , situated in a small island of chatham , joined to port blair by a bridge .
they were prepared to give everything for the cause of india ' s freedom .
the japanese had entrusted the liaison work to their intelligence officer fujiwara , who played a prominent role in carrying out negotiations .
captain mohan singh had initially told fujiwara that subhas chandra bose alone could successfully give a lead to the liberation forces .
from the very beginning the british were continuously losing their bases and there was all - round confusion .
ras behari bose , after absconding from india in the hardinge bomb case , where he had thrown a bomb made of gramophone needles , got settled in japan .
he commanded great respect among the higher echelons of japan .
his speeches made a great impression on the japanese prime minister .
it was perhaps this single factor which made the british decide to quit india and for this full credit goes to subhas chandra bose .
under the magic spell of his ' onward to delhi ' slogan .
gerade h . corr in his book the war of the springing tigers writes , the i .
but ironically it was as prisoners that they made their biggest impact on the indian people and government of india .
but it was not easy to make germany agree to his release , because nazi leaders fully realised the importance of bose in their war propaganda against the british .
according to gerad h . corr , some of the nazi leaders wanted to keep bose as a ' bargaining counter ' , in case of defeat .
the second difficulty was about the arrangement of safe passage for bose from berlin to singapore .
the only alternative was to send bose by a submarine , but neither germany nor japan was prepared to risk its submarines for this purpose .
it was finally decided that a german submarine would carry bose half way and the other half would be covered by japan .
this bond of mutual love and affection was to carry them through the most difficult periods of supreme sacrifice .
in a public meeting ras behari bose handed over the entire organisation to bose and henceforth subhas chandra bose began to be called netaji .
jai hind became the word of greetings .
the congress tricolour flag was adopted with a slight change .
the spinning wheel was replaced by a springing tiger .
as is clear from his letter dated 26 august 1943 to kikari kikan .
on 21 october 1943 bose came to cathay hall , singapore for the inauguration of the provisional government of free india .
it was a historic day .
an emotionally charged gathering cheered every word of netaji which was followed by thunderous applause .
and in front of them , stand the serried ranks of india ' s army of liberations , with the slogan ' onward to delhi ' on their lips .
india ' s army of liberation is confident of fulfilling its historic role .
netaji received congratulations from eamon de velera , president of the irish free state .
when mountbatten joined , most of the countries were under japan .
since there was not much to do at the war front , he , concentrated all his attention on subversive activities in the japanese occupied areas .
it was through this organisation that he was able to change the course of history in this region .
mountbatten was having direct and secret links with many political leaders in india .
he had been tortured by having red hot needles pushed half an inch under his nails .
the japanese wireless monitoring station at the same time intercepted messages sent out from the islands .
and was received at lamba line aerodrome , by admiral ishikava , the overall chief in the islands .
he was taken to the erstwhile government house at ross island .
the entire route was lined by men , women and children .
there was a regular ferry service between aberdeen and ross island .
people lost all interest in life and property .
perhaps they were also afraid that , in the event of the allies landing there , these people may go over to the allies .
by june 1945 , bombing had become more frequent .
men engaged in business had left for their villages and many villagers were thrown out of the villages because of the changes in the policy of landholding .
the japanese authorities proclaimed that there was very limited scope for agriculture at port blair .
to make up for this deficiency they had a plan to bring virgin land under cultivation by clearing forests .
but there was a sinister motive behind this welfare project .
more people became interested and the original number of 400 to 500 further increased to 600 .
following day , when most of them started complaining of hunger and thirst , they were all bundled up in trucks .
about 300 people were asked to board the ship akbar and the rest were loaded in the two lcts
as the boats neared the havelock island , the japanese military men with fixed bayonets and officers with drawn swords signalled the people to jump into the sea .
the people did not understand .
but how could they become food for the sharks !
but the japanese did not relent .
few managed to reach the shore .
the people all over the islands have taken to coconut plantation .
the mam reason for this poor quality of the livestock in these islands is the distance factor from the mainland .
there are no good animals in the islands , and the only source of pedigree animals is the mainland .
one of the main reasons for the poor yield of milk of the cattle in these islands is the non - availability of fodder .
which was accepted by the government of india .
the sponsoring authority is the andaman and nicobar administration and the scheme is financed by the indian dairy corporation , baroda .
a milk chilling plant of 4,000 litres capacity has been installed at the dollygunj farm complex .
this plan was subsequently revised in 1960 by j . c . verma but the revised working plan was not put into operation for administrative reasons .
education immediately before independence , the entire educational set - up in the andaman and nicobar group of islands was in a complete mess .
growing unemployment has become a big problem among the educated youth of these islands , as there are very limited avenues for employment open to them .
later , the shipping service was dislocated to a great extent .
whenever the ship touched port blair it would become a big occasion .
the offices would present a deserted look since the whole town would just throng at the jetty .
very often it becomes difficult for the local man to get a seat for an urgent visit to the mainland .
the demonstrations by people for not getting a berth is a common sight in port blair .
the malays often raided their settlements and sold them as slaves in the markets of south east asia .
they became so afraid that they were forced to retire into the deep jungles .
even now , during dark nights malay boats visit these shores with smuggled goods .
everyone lives on terms of perfect equality with his neighbours .
the nicobarese have made such a strong and secure social system that even the present laws and legal machinery have not been able to penetrate this shell .
theirs is a simple democracy bound by custom .
even today all cases which do not involve outsiders are decided by their headman , called captain or the council .
one of the greatest gifts to these islands of bishop richardson has been the introduction of western sports which are immensely popular .
, is played with tremendous enthusiasm .
the lady volley ball team of each village plays an annual inter - village lady volleyball tournament which is witnessed by thousands of spectators .
all the year round a nicobari is always celebrating some festival , either social or religious .
the festival of ka - na - ka is held by rotation in different villages .
the invitations are sent to other villages about a week before the date of the annual ceremony .
the people of car nicobar are extremely fond of the pig , which plays an important part in their social or religious functions .
after sacrificing the pig , some of them smear their bodies with its blood .
for about a month after the birth of the first child the man has to lie down in the ' lying in hut ' like an invalid patient .
as in the case of his wife , on whom women attend , in his case it is the menfolk who surround him .
however , in the case of subsequent deliveries , the period of confinement of a man is reduced just to one or two days .
some people have termed the religious form of nicobarese as ' undisguised animism ' .
as soon as the man dies , each group of houses in the village provides two yards each of red and white cloth to wrap the corpse .

partners for better oral hygiene
who are the partners ?
green fodders are not only highly palatable and whet the appetite but also increase the milk - yield .
green fodders are the best source for supply of vitamins to the animal .
they supply protein , minerals and carotene .
silage is nutritious and easily digested by cattle .
in addition , a milch cow should be given one kilogram of concentrate mixture for every two and a half kilograms of milk produced .
in the case of a buffalo , for every two kilograms of milk , one kilogram of concentrate mixture should be given .

sheep produce two different kinds of crops each year , wool and lambs .
sheep also provide rich manure .
wherever sheep flocks are cared for and flourish , agriculture has thriven .
the production of sheep meat was estimated at 131 thousand metric tonnes , valued at rupees 231.3 million , in 1959 - 60 .
sheep manure is considered a valuable source of fertilizer .
an individual sheep adds 0.5 to 0.7 tonne of manure to the soil every year .
it contains twice as much of nitrogen and potassium as is present in cattle manure .
the deccan plateau has the largest population of flocks , particularly on the eastern side of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu .
in india , there were 48.8 million sheep according to the livestock census of 1982 .
there was an increase of 19.3 per cent over that of 1977 .
in 1977 , there were 40.9 million sheep .
the remaining wool clip is classed as carpet wool .
selected flocks are raised in the nalia area of western kutch .
wool from these sheep is used for the manufacture of army hosiery and tweeds .
the colour of the fleece is white .
the annual yield varies from one to two kilograms .
it is considered a good dual - purpose breed .
the sheep have a distinctive brown head and low - set body .

the sheep yield long - stapled , coarse wool .
they are usually of white colour with tan and black hair on the face and legs .
the annual fleece yield is estimated at about 1.5 kilograms .
these animals are of medium size , and are well built .

the average annual yield is less than 500 grams .
nellore is a hairy breed but is noted for producing good mutton .
the usual colour of these sheep is white , sometimes black fawn markings are also found .
the rams are horned and the ewes are polled .
the tail of these sheep is generally very short with a hair whorl at the end .
the period of pregnancy in ewes varies form 142 to 152 days , with an average of 147 days .
unlike other animals , ewes generally do not come in heat throughout the year but are seasonal in this respect .
they come into heat every 13 to 19 days , the average being 18 days during the breeding season .
the period of heat in ewes lasts from 3 to 70 hours , with an average of 27 hours .
the optimum time of mating is towards the end of the heat - period .
at the time of lambing , the ewe shows a characteristic vertical movement of the tail and usually lags behind the flock .
in normal birth , the lamb presents itself with the head in between its front legs .
healthy ewes do not require any help at lambing .
normally , the lamb will be on its legs in a few minutes and reach for the teats .
in cold weather , the ewe and the newborn lamb should be kept in a warm place .

however , plaque that builds up along the gumline and between the teeth in hard to reach places can be harmful .
plaque buildup is a primary factor in gum disease .
the prevention of tartar buildup above the gumline has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect on gum disease .
the photographs below show three degrees of tartar , or calculus , formation :
it specially helps in putting a bloom and sheen on a horse ' s coat .
where available , molasses may be substituted for a part of the grain .
molasses are generally given after being diluted with water and mixed with grain - feed .
the most natural feed for horses is pasture grass .
good pasture is essential for their healthy and quick growth .
grasses are not only the best protective feed , but also help in reducing the feed and ration costs .
green grass is especially important for brood mares and foals .
the horse , however , prefers selected grazing and should not be left on swampy or water - logged lands .
carrots are also relished by horses .
hay or grass used for feeding should be clean and free from dust .
a foal should be handled frequently from an early age .
the colts should be taught to lead when they are one to two months old .
at first he can be led alongside his mother when she is taken out for exercise or water .
great patience and care are required to train a colt .
training should be on a system of reward or punishment , and it should immediately follow the action which deserves it .
horses learn to obey largely by association of actions with commands .
horses should be lightly groomed before going to work but they should be given vigorous grooming on their return .
the animal , however , must be cool and dry when groomed .
brush should be used on tender parts of head and legs .
shoeing of horses
' no foot , no horse ' , is an old saying .
hoof - care starts when the foal is about one month old .
generally , horses are not shod until the age of two to three years hoofs grow about 8 millimetres every month .
the stables should be so constructed as to provide sufficient protection from inclement weather , excessive heat , cold , and rain .
cool quarters with good ventilation are preferable to warm , close stables .
it makes the hoof soft and liable to many foot troubles .
the stables should always be kept clean and dry .
wet and dirty beddings cause skin diseases .
in the cold weather , the horse should be covered with a blanket after the work is over .
determining the age of a horse
the age of a horse is generally determined from its teeth .
horses have three pairs of incisor teeth in each of the upper and lower jaws .
the horse at this stage is said to be smooth mouthed .
horses may live up to the age of 40 years , but the average working life of a horse is twelve to fifteen years .
donkeys do well in hot and semi - arid areas .
they are commonly known for their stupidity and obstinacy .
these qualities are , however , the result of ill - treatment by man from time immemorial .
with sympathetic and proper handling , these vices can be minimized .
in india , there were 1.02 million donkeys in 1982 .
this was an increase of 4.7 per cent in their number over that of 1977 .
the small grey donkey is found in most parts of the country .
some of the important foreign breeds of donkeys are the white egyptian , the damascus , the persian , the arab , and the poitou donkey of france .
donkeys are generally bred at the age of 2 to 3 years .
there is no particular season for breeding donkeys .
they can be bred throughout the year .
matured male can be allowed 160 coverings in a year but not more than two services a day .
the gestation period in females varies from 11 to 12 months .
donkeys need to be shod like horses .
the usual working age for donkeys is 16 to 17 years .
the opposite cross , between a she - ass and a stallion pony is not very common .
mule is known for its great capacity for endurance under adverse conditions of climate and food .
the mule is said to be its own boss .
mules are , however , shy with strangers and are often free kickers .
mules working on hard ground need to be shod the same way as horses .
the normal pace of a mule is about five kilometres an hour and it can easily cover 24 to 32 kilometres in a day .
mules can work till the age of 18 to 20 years or even longer .
a healthy animal is active and alert .
its eyes are bright and ears frequently - pricking to and fro .
the temperature increases when the animal is excited or at work .
common diseases of equines
influenza or pink eye is a common disease in equines .
preventive measures include isolation of all suspected cases , chlorination of drinking water and adoption of strict hygienic measures .
all newly - purchased animals should be kept in a separate stable for two to three weeks .
strangles is a highly infectious disease .
the main symptoms are dullness , depression and rise in temperature .
initially there is a slight watery nasal discharge , which soon becomes thick and yellowish white , abundant and bilateral .
the lump gradually increases in size .
there is rise in temperature , difficulty in breathing and frothy discharge from the nostrils .
death takes place within 36 hours .
the animal may die in three to four days .
mortality rate in this form of disease is nearly 95 per cent .
in the case of the mixed form of the disease , both heart and lungs are affected .
camel has been aptly described as the ship of the desert .
the riverine camel are great baggagers .
they are big in stature , but slow in movement .
the riverine camel possesses coarse head with roman nose .
it has long neck , long legs and oval feet which are generally soft .
both , the male and the female , face in the same direction .
at about six months after conception , the belly of the cow - camel becomes enlarged .
at birth , the forefeet of the baby - camel come out first with the head resting between the forelegs .
at the time of calving , nature should be allowed to have its own course .
as far as possible , unnecessary interference should be avoided .
the after - birth normally comes away either with the foetus or half - an - hour or so after .
after calving , the calf should be wiped clean and directed to the dam ' s teats .
the supplementary ration may be in the form of green or dry fodder .
a continuous feeding of dry fodders renders the camels prone to indigestion and skin diseases .
changes in diet should be brought on gradually .
sudden changes in feed are a common cause of ill - health in camels .
enough time should be allowed daily to camels for cud - chewing .
if given with the grain , it is fed in the evening .
water elimination through urine and faeces in camels is also comparatively very meagre .
because of all these factors , a camel can go without water for a much longer period than other animals can .
they may drink as much as 135 litres at a time .
the danger - level in men is 165 percent .
the water given to camels should be fresh and clean .
camels prefer still water or slowly flowing water to that of running streams .
water should be given before feeding , and after unloading .
a very thirsty camel may sometimes suffer from over - distension after a quick long drink .
camels , like any other domestic animal , need adequate protection against draughts , sun and rain .
during summer months , camels may , however , be kept in the open .
a portable feeding trough should be provided , preferably under a good shady tree .
ordinarily , camels should be housed in a well - ventilated shed .
it should , however , be simple and not very expensive .
the shed should be constructed on a plot of land at a higher level than the surroundings , so that there is natural drainage of rain water .
a camel - shed is usually a three - walled enclosure , open on one side .
the open side should not face the direction of the prevailing winds .
the roof may be made of tiles or a thatch .
the floor should have a slight slope backwards , with a drain at the end .
the feeding manger should be of pucca bricks , and should be at a height of about eight centimetres from the ground .
camel is comparatively a slow maturing animal .
a camel at the age of eight years is in very much the same state of maturity as a horse at five years .
the nostril should be pierced for the nose - peg at least a month before it is intended to start breaking the camel .
the young camel should be taught as to how to keep to the line of march .
roughly , 160 to 180 kilograms freshly cut grass or fodder should be considered sufficient to meet a day ' s requirement .
in case of animals in captivity and more particularly in the case of working elephants , some concentrate ration is needed in addition to the grass and other fodder .
the concentrate ration usually consists of rice , paddy , and coarse flour .
wheat flour is commonly given after making it into chapatis .
cooked onions and tamarind pulp are also added , particularly during the hot season .
in addition they are given 56 grams of salt and 28 grams of oil daily .
large animals are provided 90 kilograms of dry fodder and 215 kilograms of green fodder .
they should be watered about an hour before they are fed .
in spite of their formidable size , elephants are surprisingly quick and obedient and possess remarkable ability to work for man .
although the elephant is a large animal , its power of endurance is much less than is generally supposed .
it possesses comparatively a delicate constitution .
it generally occurs during rainy season and takes a severe and rapid course .
this disease is characterised by rise in temperature and bleeding from the mucous membranes .
haetnorrhagic septicaemia is a highly infectious disease .
it is most prevalent during the early rains or towards the close of the monsoon .
apart from general preventive measures , treatment is not of much avail .
the urine is scanty and markedly greenish in colour .
foot and mouth disease has been reported , among elephants .
mouth and feet of the affected animals should be washed three or four times daily with some mild astringent lotion .
the disease is not a fatal one , but if proper care is not taken , it may result in serious dislocation of work .
elephant - pox is a specific fever characterized by eruptions somewhat similar to smallpox in man .
finally they burst , leaving sores which tend to scab .
remember , most tmj problems will resolve over time .
at this time clinicians note symptoms , patient history , and may use x - rays .
there are at least 50 different treatments available , often reflecting the type of provider seen .
one point is clear : there is no " one - size - fits - all " approach to managing tmj .
the safety and efficacy of jaw surgery , including implants to replace all or parts of the joint , have not been demonstrated in clinical trials .
many cases of implant failure have led to serious complications .
the annual production of poultry meat in 1991 is estimated at 3,282 million tonnes and that of offals at 429 thousand tonnes .
the yearly averages for the american breeds of white leghorn and rhode island red are 193 and 212 eggs respectively .
the size of the egg of the indian hen is also very small .
the pattern is changing now with many organized farms producing poultry on scientific lines .
a very large majority of the domestic fowls in india are nondescript .
as a rule , the name desi is given to the indigenous fowls of any description .
the number of improved fowls in india is very small .
it does not do well on heavy or wet soils and in hilly areas .
the standard weight of a cock of this breed is 2.7 kilograms and of a hen is 2 kilograms .
the standard weight of the cock is 3.8 kilograms and of the hen 3 kilograms .
the standard weight of the cock is 3.6 kilograms and of the hen 3 kilograms .
plymouth rock is a popular american breed .
in india , the cocks of this breed have proved useful for upgrading the ordinary desi hens .
australorp breed has been greatly developed in australia .
in india , this breed is rapidly gaining popularity , especially in the wet and heavy rainfall regions .
the standard weight of the cock is 3.8 kilograms and of the hen 3 kilograms .
the standard weight of the cock is 4 kilograms and of the hen 3.2 kilograms .
the breed is a good producer of large brown shelled eggs .
the standard weight of the cock is 3.8 kilograms and of the hen 2.7 kilograms .
crosses of these breeds are also very popular .
the cock of the white cornish breed has a standard weight of 3.6 kilograms and the hen 2.7 kilograms .
to protect the birds from strong winds , curtains made of thatch or canvas cloth may be provided .
shady trees in the yard besides providing shade also act as wind breakers and help in keeping down the temperature in summer .
mulberry and citrus trees are considered suitable for the purpose .
they form a nice shady umbrella during the summer months .
during winter , these trees should be thinned to permit sufficient sunshine in the yard .
for keeping large - size flocks of poultry on a commercial basis , the intensive system is considered more suitable .
under the intensive system , the hens are kept confined either on deep litter in a room or under a shed or in individual cages .
deep or built - up litter system consists in keeping the hens on a floor covered with a thick layer of litter material in a specially constructed house .
after a few months , bacterial action in the litter leads to the formation of animal protein factor , riboflavin , other vitamins and trace elements .
by adoption of this system , substantial saving is effected in the expenditure on land and labour .
before putting fresh material on the floor , all old litter and debris . should be thoroughly cleaned .
the sides of the house should be kept open and covered with wire netting above the height of 60 to 75 centimetres from the floor .
during severe cold weather , curtains of canvas or gunny cloth may be hung on the open sides in order to keep the birds warm .
in places like big cities , where space is very scarce , laying batteries are provided under the intensive system .
laying battery is a collection of cages used for housing laying hens .
the laying hens are housed individually one in each cage .
they are kept confined in these cages throughout the day and night .
a convenient size of laying battery will be a unit of about seven cages constructed in a row in one single frame .
a hen has been described to be only an egg ' s way of making another egg ,
the cost of feed represents more than half the total expenditure on raising poultry .
for most economical production , poultry need a full feeding of a balanced ration .
it is necessary to combine a number of feedstuffs to prepare a balanced ration .
it is not only important to supply all the nutrients , but more important to supply them in just the right proportions .
there must , therefore , be a balance between the nutrients , so that the feed is used most efficiently for egg production and body growth of the birds .
protein feeds , especially animal proteins are expensive .
water makes up a large proportion , approximately 60 per cent of the birds ' body weight and nearly two - thirds of that of an egg .
chickens can live longer without food than without water .
poultry needs to have water available constantly since they drink only small quantities at one time .
chickens must drink every 15 to 20 minutes .
approximate quantities of water required daily for 100 chicks up to four weeks of age are six to seven litres .
hatching of eggs
in india , poultry birds are generally kept in small units .
the eggs , therefore , are usually hatched under the hens .
after this period , the chick inside the egg breaks its outer shell with the tip of its beak and comes out .
highly soiled eggs should not be used for hatching .
with a little care , many consumer problems can be avoided .
think carefully about how you are going to pay : with cash or credit , or in some other way .
shop around and compare prices and other factors ( for example after - sales service ) .
think it through first .
and try to go to traders who have a good reputation for treating their customers fairly .
getting a satisfactory outcome from making a complaint can sometimes be easy - but not always .
do not give up at the first hurdle of the trader is unhelpful or even obstructive .
if you have a valid compliant , you have a right to have the problem sorted out .
make a note of the conversation and to whom you spoke .
if you tell the seller promptly that the goods are faulty and you do not want them you should be able to get you money back .
as long as you have not legally ' accepted ' the goods you can still ' reject ' them - that is , refuse to accept them .
one of the ways you ' accept ' goods is by keeping them , without complaint , after you have had a reasonable time to examine them
what is reasonable is not fixed ; it depends on all the circumstances .
but normally you can at least take your purchase home and try it out .
you do not have to agree to any such offer .
moreover , some credit notes may be valid for only a limited period .
once you have , in the legal sense , ' accepted goods , ' you lose your right to a full refund .
you can only claim compensation , and you have to keep your claim to a reasonable minimum .
normally you have to accept an offer to put the goods right , or the cost of a repair .
some goods have manufacturers ' guarantees .
these are useful when your statutory rights no longer apply .
the law says it is up to the seller to deal with complaints about defective goods or other failures to comply with your statutory rights .
in contracts concluded since 1st july 1995 , other kinds of unfair ' small print ' are also covered .
so the law cannot be used to argue that a contract does not represent fair value for money .
it must be accepted that good control of diabetes is the principle and main goal and patient ' s full participation in this is called for .
an ideal must be met between the physician and the patient as no single routine can suit all situations .
learning to live with diabetes provides merely guidelines in this direction .
section - 1 diabetes mellitus is known to mankind from time immemorial .
according to the ayurveda ( ancient hindu system of medicine ) , the morbid secretion of urine in general is called prameha , profuse urination .
twenty varieties , according to the nature of urine , have been described in the ancient hindu texts under the subject prameha .
if you have the receipt or other proof of purchase , take this with you .
explain the problem , say what you want done , and set a deadline .
if you are not satisfied , put your complaint in writing .
if the shop is part of a chain , write to the head office .
address your letter to the customer services manager or the chairman .
complaining about services
give the supplier a chance to put the matter right .
if you are not satisfied , put your complaint in writing , saying what you have done , and set a deadline .
if you are dealing with a larger business , address your letter to the customer services manager or the chairman .
it may be desirable to seek further advice .
you may wish to take advice on this .
continuing to pay will not undermine any claim you have against the lender for unsatisfactory service by a supplier .
keep copies of letters along with a diary of events and a note of any telephone calls . take photographs if relevant .
consider getting a written expert opinion to back up your complaint .
this may cost money , but could be invaluable if you need to take legal action .
if you telephone :
1 . make a note before hand of what you want to say ;
2 . have receipts and any other documents handy ;
3 . get the name of the person you want to speak to ;
4 . write down the date and time and what is said ;
5 . follow up your call with a letter , particularly if your complaint is a serious one .
if you put it in writing :
1 . describe the item or service ;
2 . say where and when you bought the item or when the service was done , and how much it cost ;
3 . explain what is wrong , any action you have already taken , to whom you spoke and what happened ;
6 . keep copies of any letters you send .
if you have a problem with goods or services bought on credit , you may have some additional protection .
who can help ?
trading standards ( or consumer protection ) departments of local authorities
they can help in many situations relating to goods and services .
they will often advise on everyday shopping problems .
the address is in the telephone book under the local authority to which you pay your council tax .
in northern ireland contact the trading standards branch of the department of economic development .
some trading standards departments run consumer advice centres near main shopping areas .
these offer advice and information to shoppers and traders , and deal with problems and complaints .
it is worth checking if there is one near you .
traders often belong to trade associations .
if they have , then an arbitrator should find in your favour .
not everyone who claims to be a member of a trade association is , so it is worth checking with the association .
you can find the names and addresses of relevant trade associations from your local library or citizens advice bureau .
if you have a complaint about utilities ( gas , water , electricity , or telephones ) , try first to sort out the problem with the company .
your bill will have a customer service telephone number that you can call .
these four utilities all have a regulator who has the power to help resolve customers ' problems .
contact numbers for these regulators can also be found on the back of your bill .
there are ombudsmen for services such as banking , building societies , funerals and insurance . see pages 89 - 90 for addresses .
taking further action
if you are struggling to get a complaint sorted out , you can take further action .
just telling a trader who is being unhelpful or obstructive that you will go to court could be enough to get your complaint resolved .
if you do have to take legal action , it can be much easier than it sounds and could be well worth the effort .
conciliation and arbitration
if the trader is a member of a trade association , there may be a conciliation or arbitration scheme you can use .
do not be put off - such schemes are informal and generally inexpensive .
but arbitration may not necessarily be cheaper than going to court under the small claims procedure .
check what fees you will be expected to pay if you lose the case .
in conciliation , the idea is to enable the parties to settle their differences themselves .
arbitration is more like going to court , and is very straightforward .
the arbitrator or arbiter will be independent and an expert in the particular field concerned , and may be a member of the chartered institute of arbitrators .
you have to choose between court and arbitration - you cannot do both .
if you do not like an arbitrator ' s decision , you cannot then go to court ( except in special circumstances ) .
arbitration is often done in writing .
if you feel happier putting your case in person , you should consider using the small claims procedure in the county court .
before going to arbitration or to court you may wish to seek an impartial opinion on the merits of your case .
your local citizens advice bureau can help you find such a solicitor .
these ' small claims ' cases are heard informally in private .
fees depend on the amount claimed .
if your opponent employs a solicitor , you can not be charged the cost even if you lose your case .
you do not need to use technical language .
as a result of excess sugar , the diabetics , they have observed , will develop multiple abscesses in the body .
it has also been mentioned in these texts that the diabetic condition can also be due to the " born sweetness of the body " .
but they are not enforceable if a court finds them unfair .
see pages 19 - 20 about unfair terms generally .
doorstep selling
do not feel pressured by this kind of offer .
the rule is ' buyer beware ' , so make sure you check that you are getting a good buy .
but , in practice , this could be difficult to enforce .
so it is a good idea to take someone with you when buying privately , to act as a witness .
you should also ask for a written description of the goods .
beware of traders who pose as private sellers , perhaps at a car boot sale or through a small advertisement .
this practice is illegal and takes advantage of the fact that you have fewer rights when you buy from a private seller .
if the person is a trader , your statutory rights will then apply .
the trading standards department can also take action to stop the trader posing as a private seller .
some manufacturers are also willing to replace or offer refunds on new cars provided they are returned within a certain time of mileage limit .
buying a used car from a dealer
when you go to a garage , take a friend for a second opinion , preferably one who knows about cars .
is the mileage guaranteed ?
selling a car with a false mileage is illegal .
your dealer may have access to a database of vehicle mileages .
ask if any check has been made .
you could ask to see the vehicle registration document and contact the last owner to check the mileage .
ask for proof of identity .
inspect the car at the seller ' s home in daylight and satisfy yourself that the seller lives there .
ask for a test drive , but be very careful to ensure that you are covered by your own insurance to drive another person ' s car .
be wary of relying on the seller ' s assurance that the car is insured for you to drive .
there will be a service record book in which servicing details should have been recorded .
car auctions
if you are looking for a bargain at an auction , make sure you know what you are doing .
go as a spectator first and see what happens .
furniture often has to be ordered and you may have to pay a deposit .
check that you know exactly how much you will have to pay for the goods when they arrive .
if you have a complaint
direct your complaint to the trader who sold you the goods .
follow the suggested procedure for complaints on page 22 .
get quotations from three or four contractors and consider them carefully .
make sure they cover everything that you require .
a guarantee is an addition to your statutory rights - it cannot replace or remove these rights .
do not agree to have work done simply because someone happens to knock on your door with an offer .
if you are interested , ask for more information and give yourself time to get estimates from other traders to compare .
this will , among other things , specify the intervals at which payments will be made . one copy goes to the contractor and you should keep the other .
contractors who are members of trade associations will usually publicise this and will be able to supply the addresses and telephone numbers .
see pages 30 - 35 for details .
a consumer adviser , solicitor or other expert can provide independent advice on the merits of your case .
holidays can be expensive , so it is important to think about what you want before you book .
a few simple precautions will help to ensure that you are not disappointed .
choose travel agents and tour operators which belong to a trade organisation that has a code of practice .
look for abta ( association of british travel agents ) or aito ( association of independent tour operators ) on brochures or invoices .
cancellation of , or cutting short your holiday ;
illness or injury while you are away ;
loss or theft of your belongings ;
delayed or missed departures ;
liability for accidents to others .
if you have a problem whilst you are on a package holiday , bring it immediately to the attention of the tour operator ' s representative at the resort .
if necessary ask for a complaint form , or put your complaint in writing in a separate letter .
if things are not put right straight away , collect evidence about the problems such as photographs , statements from other holiday makers .
once you get home , check what your holiday brochure said .
the pancreas does not secrete insulin to turn these foods into energy or to store them for future use .
too much sugar in the blood and urine is a sign of diabetes .
diabetes is a metabolic disease , i . e . something is wrong with the body ' s biochemical processes .
meanwhile , the kidneys filter about 40 gallons of blood a day .
in fact , the full name of the disease , diabetes mellitus , actually means " siphoning ( diabetes ) of the honey - urine ( mellitus ) " .
the three classic symptoms of diabetes , when they occur , are increased thirst ( polydypsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) and increased urination ( polyuria ) .
it is an offence for operators to misdescribe what they offer you .
the contact the tour operator and send them copies of your evidence ( always keep the originals ) .
abta provides an independent arbitration service and aito an independent dispute settlement service which you can use if you wish .
see pages 30 - 35 for more on arbitration and going to court , and where to get help .

this leaflet aims to answer some of the most commonly asked questions about organ donation .
what is organ donation ?
in others , it will allow blind people to see again .
what organs can be donated ?
the major donor organs are the kidneys , heart , lungs , liver , and pancreas .
this means that one donor can help many other patients .
who will receive the organs ?
the time of the death is the time of the second set of tests .
when the brain stem stops working , a person can not be regarded as alive .
will all the organs be used ?
all healthy organs are normally used .
in most cases , organs can be used despite advanced age and previous illness .
if you have suffered from certain illness , this could rule out the donation of some organs but not others .
will the organs be used for research ?
will my body be damaged by organ donation ?
when any organs are removed , it is done by a skilled operating team .
and once the operation is over , there will be no sign that any organs have been removed .
will the funeral be delayed ?
the body can be viewed after the organs have been removed , and the funeral need not be delayed in any way .
once a patient has been certified as brain stem dead , the relatives will be asked to agree to organ donation .
will my relatives know who receives my organ ?
strict confidentiality is maintained throughout the donation and transplantation process .
why are there different answers ?
there are many different kinds of drugs - some like tobacco are legal , others like ecstasy and cannabis are not .
different drugs have different effects on people ; som of these effects are more dangerous than others .
some drugs are more socially acceptable than others .
every child is different and the reasons why they might turn to drugs will be varied .
there are different facilities for helping young people with drug problems in different parts of the country .
so where you live may affect what help you can get if you need it .
do you know enough about drugs ?
most parents are not well - informed about the effects of various drugs ; there is a lot of confusing and inaccurate information around .
by contrast , one lsd trip might result in psychological damage to somebody with latent mental illness .
of those young people who try illegal drugs , most obtain them from friends .
instead , they need to listen to their child ' s own explanations to form a round view .
however , here are some reasons which are quite common :
the opportunity rose and the youngster just tried it .
in this example there may no long - term problem .
a discussion , a warning , and some monitoring of behaviour may be appropriate .
so while it is important to stress the risks , the information given must be factually accurate .
some youngsters will use drugs or solvents in an attempt to blot out exciting problems .
for those few young people who are dependent on drugs a lot of careful work may be needed .
if they can be helped with these problems then they will probably stop , or at least reduce , their drug intake .
in the meantime , it is sensible to give advice on how to reduce damage to health .

summary of treatment plan important points for iddm patients on insulin use are as follows :
division and spread of carbohydrates throughout the day .
exercise : type , extent , merits and demerits depending on age and overall physical condition , exercise plays a very important role in the management programme of diabetes .
there are several good reasons why regular physical activity may be helpful :
if one ' has not been very active , discuss exercise with the physician before setting out on one ' s own .
types of exercise and how much is best for one will depend on one ' s physical and metabolic status .
exercise information for persons with iddm benefits can lower blood glucose levels during and after an exercise session . increases sensitivity of body cells to insulin .
increases physical fitness .
decreases total cholesterol and increases high density lipo - protein cholesterol ( the ' good ' cholesterol ) .
blood pressure during exercise may rise higher in persons with diabetes than in persons who do not have diabetes .
insulin deficiency with poor control of exercise can cause a further rise in blood glucose or even precipitate ketosis .
blood glucose can drop too low during or after exercise continued for long duration .

great care should be taken in selecting the bull for breeding .
the bull should be typical of the breed and should come from parents with high milk yield .
milk is an inherited character which the calf inherits from its dam and sire .
the bull should , therefore , belong to a family where the females have given good yields .
a bull should not be used for breeding purposes unless it attains proper maturity .
generally , one bull is considered sufficient for 60 to 70 cows or buffaloes of breedable age .
she should have a marked wedge - shaped body .

it is a mistake to assume that suckling calves do not require water because they are being fed largely on milk .
a working bullock would need 32 litres of water daily .
idle cattle require about 22 litres a day .
regularity in feeding , grazing and milking nowhere pays better dividends than in the case of milch animals .
milking of animals
full - hand method for milking should be practised .
the young calf often butts while sucking milk from the bucket .
dehorning is commonly practised in milch cattle , especially in large dairy herds .
dehorned cattle are easier to handle than those with horns .
calves can be dehorned when one to two weeks old .
vaseline should be applied on the outer edges of the circles .
after dehorning , the calf should be kept tied for a day or two , to avoid injury to the affected parts .
why you need a prophylaxis ( professional cleaning ) .
professional cleaning removes plaque , calculus ( tartar ) , and stain from the teeth .
what is plaque ?
plaque that builds up along the gumline and between teeth in hard to reach places can be harmful .
the bacteria in plaque produce toxins that can irritate the gums causing them to turn red , swell and bleedthe signs typically associated with gingivitis .
recognizing gingivitis is important because it is reversible .
the cut should be given on cords of both sides of the testicles .
tincture of iodine ' should be applied on the cuts to avoid infection .
this exerts constant pressure .
when the testicles have been absorbed , the ring drops down .
the shoe should be made to fit the natural shape of the hoof .
animals with soft hoofs require shoeing more frequently than those with hard hoofs .
animals that keep their head erect when standing and their tail high when at work , are generally considered more alert and brisk .
the bullock should be of good size and height .
the neck should be muscular and strong .
the feet should be hard , black and waxy .
the two halves should be even .
the cleft of the hoof should be narrow .
determining the age of cattle
the age of cattle can be determined from their teeth .
cattle have no front teeth on the upper jaw .
a calf at birth has two temporary incisors or milk teeth in the lower jaw .
at one week , it has four , at two weeks six , and at four weeks eight milk teeth .
normally , at about 2 to 2 1 / 2 years , there are two permanent incisors .
at about three years there are four permanent incisors .
at four years there are six , and at about five years , there are eight permanent incisors .
after the age of five years , the age of cattle can be judged by noticing the extent of wear and tear of the teeth .
the direction of prevailing winds should be well sheltered .
as far as possible , a cattle - shed should not be too close to human dwellings .
the building should not be expensive but should be comfortable and sanitary .
for a small number , standing space in a single row with a feeding trough in front and a drain at the back is considered adequate .
calves should be kept separately and should be brought to the cows only at the time of milking .
the grown - up calves should be kept separately from suckling calves .
after the age of six months , the male and female calves should be kept in separate enclosures .
bull - shed should have a large enclosure to allow free movement and exercise for the bull .
the flooring of cattle - sheds should be pucca .
the best material for the purpose is cement concrete which can be washed and cleaned every day .
the provision of a good drain channel in a cattle - shed is very important .
the drain should be wide enough to hold dung and urine , which can be removed at regular intervals .
the method of conserving cattle dung followed in the villages is to pile up the dung and other refuse in heaps on the ground .
urine , which is a very rich part of the manure , should also be properly conserved .
diseases take a heavy toll of the lives of cattle every year .
diseases also lower the productive efficiency of the animals and thus result in a great economic loss to the owner .
cattle in normal health appear bright , active and alert in their movements .
they enjoy normal sleep and appetite .
the first signs of ill - health are the cessation of rumination , and drop in milk yield .
there is a discharge from the eyes , nostrils , and mouth .
the animal is restless and frequently changes postures .
the normal body temperature in cattle is about 38.3 degrees c ( 101 degrees f ) .
temperature can be observed by inserting an ordinary clinical thermometer in the anus of the animal .
the pulse rate varies from 40 to 60 per minute .
the pulse can be felt on the underside of the tail near its root .
respiration varies from 15 to 30 per minute .
the pulse rate varies from 40 to 45 per minute .
respiration rate ranges from 16 to 18 per minute .
most of the contagious diseases in cattle can be prevented and controlled by timely vaccination and by observing suitable precautions .

the animal is affected just before or after parturition within 72 hours of calving .
the temperature is usually below normal .
urination and passing of dung are temporarily stopped .
the udder should be gently massaged to distribute the air throughout the udder .
the first sign of regaining consciousness is the dropping of dung and urination .
the affected animal should not be milked for 12 hours after she has regained consciousness .
the udder should not be completely emptied while milking for two or three days .

in recent years , a few exotic breeds of sheep have been introduced in india for the upgrading of indigenous sheep .
merino rams of australian and german origins and rambouillet rams have been used in large numbers .
these have given encouraging results in improving the quality of indigenous stock .
merinos are extremely hardy and the ewes live and produce longer than most of the other breeds .
the brisket should be wide and fleshy .
a good ewe should be uniform in its body structure .
for wool breeds , the ram should have a dense fleece of good quality .
the lambs which have more of hair than wool should be rejected .
glossy , close , thin and transparent hair on the face and legs is a sign of good fleece .
the space between the horns or on the top of the head should be free from stiff hair .
those lambs which attain good weight at the age of four to five months , yield more profits .
the mutton from lambs at weaning age is of best quality .
young rams should never be allowed to serve more than 40 ewes during the breeding season .
rams of four to six years of age may be allowed up to 50 ewes .
when rams are changed to a new place , they should be allowed to rest and get used to new surroundings before being put to service .

next , brush the outside back teeth , starting along the gumline .
inside front teeth . tilt the brush vertically , use an up - and - down motion . chewing surfaces .
gently guide the floss between teeth .
to remove plaque and debris , gently move the floss up and down against the tooth . *
as you move from tooth to tooth , use a fresh section of floss each time .
* or use another interdental cleaning device .
a good practice is to graze flocks in a light soil in the morning and on fallows of heavier soils in the afternoon .
the winter - dew on the grass should be avoided .
in summer , sheep should be grazed on land where there is a hardy grass like dub or kunda .
normally , the quantity of fodder required by sheep varies from 2.5 to 5 kilograms of green material daily .
sheep are generally not given any grain ration except when they are to be fattened for the - mutton market .
fresh , clean water is essential for sheep to maintain good health .
unless forced to drink from stagnant pools , sheep will prefer flowing rivulets as the source of drinking water .
most of the major ailments of sheep ' are caused by dirty stagnant water .
sheep by nature are docile and obedient .
they instinctively follow the leader .
this habit is taken advantage of in herding them on fields and pastures .
sheep unlike cattle and horses are generally reared in larger groups under natural conditions for the greater part of the year .
individual care in the case of sheep is neither economical nor feasible .
sheep love to live as natural a life as possible .
they do not need any special facilities .
they should , however , be provided protection during nights from wild animals and inclement weather .
a floor space of one to two square metres per sheep should be provided .
shearing of wool
fleece provides natural protection for sheep against inclement weather .
shearing should , therefore , be done when the weather is neither too cold nor too hot .
chilly winds accompanied by driving rains will ruin the health of newly - shorn sheep .
sheep are , generally , shorn either at the end of the rainy season or in the beginning of summer .
in many places , the flocks are shorn twice a year .
sheep are generally washed before shearing .
they should , however , be perfectly dry before starting shearing .
at about 24 to 26 months , second pair of permanent teeth appear .
at 36 months , third pair appears and the fourth pair of permanent incisors is formed at the age of four years .
common diseases of sheep
most of the infectious diseases in sheep are caused as a result of poor management practices .
over - stocking , grazing on low wet lands , sudden change in environments and feed are some of the main causes of sickness in sheep .
the use of proper sprays , dips or dust are essential for the control of external parasites .
internal parasites can be controlled through proper pasture management and by keeping the sheep under hygienic conditions .
the goats are combed for eight to ten days and the undercoat collected , leaving the long silky hair to be clipped later .
the long hair are commonly used for making ropes and numdas .
gaddi and chatnba goats are found in the himalayan ranges in the neighbourhood of kangra valley , chamba , sirmur and shimla in himachal pradesh .

these goats have a small but well - set udder , and pointed teats .
their meat is coarse and devoid of fat .
pashtnina goats are mostly reared in ladakh , the lahaul and spiti valleys , and the chini valley and its neighbouring areas of himachal pradesh .
large herds of these goats are found in the changthang area at elevations of 12,000 to 14,000 feet .
the ears are long and pendulous .
the coarse hair covers the major portion of the face .
the longer and finer pashmina is grown on the sides and shoulders .
the majority of goats are white in colour , but brown and grey are not uncommon .
in hills , these goats are used for transport , particularly at higher altitudes .
they are dual - purpose goats , combining meat and milk qualities .
they have a large body , short , flat horns and long , wide , pendulous ears .
it resembles the jamnapari breed but is smaller in size .
these goats are prolific .
they give appreciable quantities of milk .
beetal goats have long , pendulous , flat ears and a roman nose like that of jamnapari .
the horns are curved with a tendency to grow outward .
the usual colours are red and tan , often heavily spotted on white .

the chest is wide and the legs are short .
the ears are nearly upright .
these animals have a dark black colour .
the skin is of very superior quality and is in great demand both in india and abroad .
selection of milch goats
a good milch goat should have a long , deep and wedge - shaped body .
the neck should be long and slim .
the udder should be long , extending below between the thighs and carried forward along the belly .
it should be well - attached to the body .
the udder should have a soft and spongy texture .
it should collapse and reduce greatly in size after milking .
teats should be of medium size , uniform and sloping slightly forward and not outward .
it should have a large , long and deep body .
the chest should be prominent and broad , with ribs well - sprung .
the legs should be straight and the feet strong .
a sire , whose dam is a poor milker , should not be used as a stud for milch goats .
goats have a tendency to mature at an early age .
the best age to mate is , however , 15 to 18 months and should kid for the first time when they are about two years old .
therefore , the two sexes should be kept separate from the age of two or three months .
the male is considered at his best for stud purposes , when two to three years of age .
but it can be used as early as 12 months of age on a limited number of goats .
a well - built mature buck can serve from 75 to 100 females a year , provided he is kept in a good healthy condition .
a good male keeps fit for breeding till about ten years of age .
the general signs of heat in goats are like those in cows and buffaloes .
the doe in heat becomes very restless , , shakes its tail , keeps bleating in a peculiar way and goes off her feed .
the heat period in goats lasts from one to three days in summer .
for the best results , the goat should be mated between the tenth and fifteenth hour after the first appearance of the signs of heat .
during the normal breeding season , one service is generally enough .
the signs of pregnancy generally do not appear till two and a half months - after mating .
a few days before parturition , the udder begins to enlarge and mammary glands show signs of activity .
sometimes , heavy milkers have to be milked several times before the kid is born .
the goat gives birth while lying down .
in normal delivery , the whole thing is completed in about 45 minutes .
the mother cleanses the body of the new - born kid by licking .
the thin membrane covering the nose and mouth of the kid should be wiped off with a clean cloth .
the navel of the kid should be disinfected properly .
normally , the kids get on their legs within a few minutes after birth .
care should be taken that milk from both the teats is drawn evenly and completely .
the kids are generally weaned at the age of about three months .
it is considered a more hygienic and better method of rearing kids .
weaned kids can be fed milk from a bottle like human babies .
as compared to the milk of other animals , goat ' s " milk approaches nearest to human milk in fat percentage and proteins .
its sugar content is slightly less and ash content more than in human milk .
your gum separates from the tooth and the bone level deteriorates .
your dentist will examine you for periodontal disease during each routine checkup .
treatment will depend upon the type of periodontal disease and how far the condition has progressed .
treatment options include :
oral irrigation directs liquid below the gumline to flush out toxins and germs to help restore the gums to health .
if deep pockets are found and bone has been destroyed , your dentist may recommend periodontal surgery .
due to its superior digestibility , it is widely used for babies , invalids and convalescents .
many people have a prejudice against goat ' s milk due to its peculiar flavour .
this can , however , be easily overcome if the goats are kept under clean and hygienic conditions away from the buck .
it is the buck which emits the objectionable goaty odour , specially during the breeding season .
they especially relish leaves , twigs , and tender buds of mulberry , neem , her , babul , and tamarind .
different varieties of feeds during the day suit the nature of the goats .
no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the quantity of fodder that may be fed to a goat .
a part of it may be substituted with dry fodder such as dry leaves or the hay of leguminous forage crops .
high milk - yielders will need an extra concentrate feed .
stud bucks should be given daily 500 grams of grain mixture during the breeding season .
minerals constitute an essential part of the goat ' s ration .
the most important minerals required for feeding goats are calcium and phosphorus .
stall - fed animals should be given small quantities of common salt with the daily ration .
many goats hardly ever drink water , if they have plenty of green feed .
goats love to drink water from a running stream .
under village conditions , goats generally do not require any special arrangements for housing .
they , however , should be protected against bad weather , wild animals and pests .
the place should be always kept properly drained .
the kids should be kept in warm houses , especially in chilly weather .
the buck should be housed away from the milking goats to avoid the peculiar odour which is usually associated with goat ' s milk .
castration also improves the quality of meat .
before milking , the milker should wash his hands properly and the udder and teats should be wiped with a clean damp cloth .
the milk vessels should be clean and properly washed .
the milking place should always be kept clean and dry .
a goat should be groomed every day with a soft brush .
it keeps the animal clean and imparts a glossy appearance to its coat .
bucks of those breeds which have long hair are generally trimmed .
this helps to keep them clean .
their face and front legs should be washed daily as they are usually in the habit of passing urine over their face and front legs .
when goats are confined to stalls , their feet require special attention .
common diseases of goats
unlike other domestic animals , goats are comparatively less prone to serious diseases .
the normal temperature of a goat is 39.4 degrees c ( 103 degrees f ) .
the average pulse rate varies from 68 to 90 and respiration from 20 to 30 per minute .
the most common contagious diseases of goats are anthrax , goat pox , pleuropneumonia , and foot and mouth disease .
the carcasses of dead animals should be burnt or buried deep after covering with quick - lime .
their milk should not be used for human consumption .
preventive measures comprise segregation of affected animals and vaccination against the disease .
pig - raising in india pig - raising and pork industry , in india , are in a very primitive stage .
pig - rearing is almost entirely in the hands of backward classes and poor people with little resources .
it is small - sized and produces small litters .
under the prevailing conditions of management , the country pigs are mostly neglected .
they do not get a fair chance to grow into economical animals .
in india , there were 7.6 million pigs in 1977 .
according to the livestock census 1982 , there were 10.07 million pigs , which showed a dramatic increase of 32 per cent over that of 1977 .
improvement of the country pigs , in india , is generally sought through upgrading by the use of the boars of some of the exotic breeds .
this has given very encouraging results with the minimum outlay .
middle white is early maturing and a well - known producer of high - class pork at comparatively low cost .
this breed has been found more suitable to thrive under indian village conditions as compared to other exotic breeds .
this breed is white in colour , the neck is full to shoulders , which are wide .
boars of this breed , when fully grown , weigh about 250 to 350 kilograms .
the weight of an average sow varies from 175 to 275 kilograms .
it is valued as a producer of meat , especially suitable for the pork market .
berkshire breed is black in colour with white markings usually on the feet , head and tail .
it has short head with dished face .
the body is long and ribs well - sprung .
a full - grown boar weighs about 275 to 375 kilograms and an average sow weighs from 200 to 300 kilograms .
the other important breeds of pigs of british origin are tamworth , essex and wessex saddleback .
chester white , duroc , and hampshire breeds are popular in america .
selection and management of breeding boars
the breeding boar , being the most important member of the herd , should be selected with care .
a good breeding boar should be masculine in appearance .
the body should be of good length and the shoulder should not be too heavy .
when the sows come into season , the boar should be allowed to serve them once .
boars are often temperamental and may not serve in unaccustomed surroundings .
repeated failures in service may lead to the boar ' s complete refusal to serve even when the sow is fully on heat .
cements the crown into place .
few incidents have greater impact on dental health and personal appearance than tooth loss .
when tooth loss occurs , your dentist may recommend the placement of a bridge .
a bridge is one or more replacement teeth anchored by one or more crowns on each side .
initially , the dentist prepares teeth on each side of the space to receive crowns and makes an impression of the entire area .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

she should have proper mammary development with twelve to fourteen teats evenly distributed on the two sides of the belly .
two litters may be obtained in a year under proper conditions of feeding and management .
during pregnancy , it is essential to give the sow regular exercise .
the sow should be maintained on a light diet for the first three days after farrowing .
thereafter she should be given normal feed as her appetite improves .
the ration may be given moist or in the form of a thick slop .
there should always be an ample supply of clean drinking water .
the most critical period in the life of a pig is its first three days .
a sow , when fed a good ration , may produce from three to four kilograms of milk per day .
its milk is richer than that of the cow , especially in proteins and minerals .
the sow must receive feeds containing these nutrients in sufficient amounts to produce the milk required by the litter .
they should be given feeding stuffs of comparatively low fibre content such as cereal grains and their by - products .
the practical way to check this is to see that the feeding troughs are cleaned up in reasonable time after each feed .
the growing stock needs more of proteins for the repair of tissues , minerals for the building up of bones and vitamins for a healthy growth .
mature pigs need more of starchy food for energy and to put on fat .
depending upon the season and the nature of feeds , sufficient fresh water should be made available .
the required quantity of mineral mixture can also be added to the green ration .
at about one month ' s age , the piglet should get feed prepared by mixing wheat milling offals and barley or maize in skimmed milk .
a few days before weaning , the diet of the young pigs should be increased gradually .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

the importance of regular visits
why does your dentist want to schedule another appointment with you so soon - even if today ' s oral examination was perfect ?
regular dental visits are essential to maintaining healthy teeth and gums .
for maximum benefit , a good home care regimen must be supplemented with an examination at least every six months .
teeth &amp; gums immediately after dental cleaning .
several months after cleaning , teeth can have plaque build - up as well as stains from food , beverages , tobacco , etc .
over time , plaque build - up can harden into tartar ( or calculus ) formation .
special attention is needed in the feeding of breeding boars to get the maximum service .
in addition to the usual ration , stud boar should get an ample supplement of mineral mixture .
grains should always be crushed and soaked for a few hours before feeding to ensure proper digestion .
hay from some suitable legume should also be given .
a good mixture should consist of 20 parts of maize to one part each of slaughterhouse waste and soyabean meal .
piglet influenza is an infectious disease which generally occurs in young pigs .
as a class , horses , mules and donkeys are first cousins .
the present - day horse is believed to have descended from an animal not bigger than a fox .
it has passed through at least twelve distinct stages during a period of over three million years .

since time immemorial , horses have served man both for work and for sport .
horse is a useful animal specially suitable for quick and easy transport .
it provides a cheaper form of transport for carrying short distances .
most of the indian breeds are well adapted for the specialised type of work they are required to perform .
the head of the kathiawari is like that of the arab horse .
checking your teeth for decay is only a small part of a thorough oral exam .
your dentist or hygienist will clean your teeth and encourage you to maintain good oral hygiene .
the regular dental visit
at every regularly - scheduled dental appointment , your dentist examines your teeth , gums , mouth and throat .
a regular dental visit may include the following :

the most favoured colours are chestnut and bay .
marwari horses are majestic , noble and handsome .
they are noted for ease of pace , speed and endurance .
these animals are very popular in the hilly areas for riding as well as for pack purposes .
manipuri ponies have been bred for many centuries in manipur .

they are in great demand for polo , racing and for military transport .
the prevailing colours are dark grey , iron - grey and dun .
it is well - known for its stamina to withstand long journeys , inclement weather and its capacity to subsist on meagre ration .
a great many of the horses used in india for riding , racing and polo possess , to varying degrees , arab and thoroughbred strains in them .
the arab is con ' sidered the most ancient breed of horses which forms the basis of nearly all present - day light horse breeds .
arab is considered art ideal breed for riding purposes and for carrying weight .
horses , as compared to other domestic animals , have a lower reproductive rate .
they are more difficult to breed and have a longer gestation period .
for a breeding farm , 70 per cent is considered a good average .
after foaling , a mare comes into heat in four to eleven days which is called a foal - heat .
the oestral cycle in mares averages 21 days .
the duration of heat varies from seven to nine days .
the optimum time to breed a mare is late in the heat - period , usually on the seventh day of heat .
as a rule , the mare drops one foal at each birth .
the genital organs of the stallion should be washed properly after each service .
a mare carries her young for 340 days .
after the mares have been served , they continue to work as usual till they are almost half way through their pregnancy period .
for the last four or five months of pregnancy , however , the mare should not be allowed to work for long hours .
a week or ten days before the foal is expected , the mare should be put in a roomy box .
other signs of approaching parturition are a depression of the croup muscles on either side of the tail and relaxation of the lips of the vulva .
just before foaling , the mare is restless , paws the bedding , sweats a little and frequently lies down . and gets up .
a normal foal will be on its legs in ten minutes to an hour after birth .
the foal should begin to suck milk from its mother immediately as it is able to rise .
the colostrum or first milk from the mare is laxative and healthy for the new - born .
at birth , a foal usually weighs from six to ten per cent of the weight of the mother .
a mare ' s milk contains 9.42 per cent solids .
its fat and protein contents are very low as compared to the milk from cow or goat .
the horse is a herbivorous animal , but does not ruminate like a cow or camel .
the horse , therefore , needs to be fed oftener but in smaller quantities .
it is a general practice to feed hay before grain is given to the horse .
a horse should not be put to hard work after full feed , nor a full feed should be given to an exhausted horse .
this is a very common cause of digestive troubles in horses .
it is best to give water before feeding .
the horse should never be fed stale , mouldy or inferior stuffs .
oats have sufficient protein content to make a balanced ration when fed along with grass hays .
bran is rich in phosphorus but deficient in calcium .
this deficiency can be made up by - providing food hay .
bran is generally fed dry but may be fed as a mash prepared with hot water .
linseed meal is a protein - rich feed for horses .
salt and minerals are essential to keep horses healthy , especially for pregnant and nursing mares .
horses should be given daily 28 to 56 grams of mineral mixture consisting of equal parts of finely - ground limestone , steamed bonemeal and salt .
iodized salt should be added in iodine deficient areas .
when green grass is available , half a kilogram of hay may be substituted by 1.5 kilograms of green grass .
horses should be supplied with plenty of fresh water at regular hours .
they should not be supplied with water immediately before and after being put to work .
a horse , on an average , drinks 45 to 55 litres of water in a day .
horses feel greatly encouraged when affectionately patted .
vigorous exercise helps to maintain hard physical condition and health of a horse .
plenty of exercise is especially important for brood mares , stallions and colts .
the stallion should be given sufficient exercise , especially during the breeding season by driving it or riding for eight to ten kilometres every day .
when starting the day ' s work , the horses should be gradually warmed to their task , before being put to extreme exertion .
horses need regular and vigorous grooming to keep them healthy .
proper grooming keeps the horse clean and helps in imparting a glossy and shining coat to the skin .
massaging stimulates blood circulation and improves the condition and general appearance of the animal .
it also provides a sort of passive exercise .
the first pair of incisor milk teeth appear before the foal is two weeks old .
the second pair comes at four to eight weeks of age and the third corner pair appear in six to nine months .
a yearling will have all the six incisor milk teeth in both the upper and lower jaws .
the permanent central incisors start erupting after about two and a half years .
the three - year old horse has one pair of permanent incisors in each jaw .
a four - year - old has two pairs and a five - year - old has three pairs of permanent incisors .
the age of a horse from 5 to 12 years can be approximately judged from the presence or absence of cups in the wearing surface of the teeth .
by the time a horse reaches an age of 10 to 12 years , the cups in all the incisor teeth disappear .
the heat - period lasts three to seven days .
the animal can be bred after parturition after six to eight weeks .
the lactation period ranges from 6 to 12 months .
the young one is generally weaned at the age of six months .
usually one young is born at a time .
the milk of an ass is easy fo digest .
donkeys usually move at a pace of three to five kilometres per hour and can cover about 25 to 32 kilometres in a day .
the present number of mules in india is , however , very small .
according to 1982 census figures , there were 131,000 mules in india which represented a 47 per cent increase over 1977 .
to keep mules in good working condition , they need constant care and attention .
the same general rules of feeding and stable management are applicable to them as to the horses .
they , however , can thrive on poor fodder and are less susceptible to diseases .
this system provides nourishment for the cells within the tooth .
deep tooth decay or other injury can cause damage to or infection of the tooth pulp .
some indications of the need for root canal treatment may be :
spontaneous pain or throbbing while biting .
sensitivity to hot and cold foods .
severe decay or an injury that creates an abscess ( infection ) in the bone .
step 1 after the tooth is anesthetized , an opening is made through the crown into the pulp chamber .
the length of the root canals is determined .
a metal post may be added for structural support or to retain restorative materials .
the temperature in a horse , can be taken with an ordinary clinical thermometer inserted in the rectum for three minutes .
the normal pulse rate of the horse at rest varies from 36 to 40 per minute .
the pulse count can be taken by placing the finger tips over the artery that rounds the jawbone in front of the large cheek muscle .
in a healthy horse , breathing will subside to normal more quickly than his pulse rate after exercise is stopped .
the breathing rate may be observed by watching the movements of the flank or the nostrils .
in a healthy horse , the bowels are moved frequently , about eight to ten times in 24 hours .
the droppings are usually in the form of balls that are soft enough to split as they fall on the ground .
the urine is passed several times daily and is light yellow in colour .
stiffness appears in different parts of the body .
tail is kept raised and quivering .
cold patchy swellings develop all over the body .
the animal lies down , rolls , gets up again , looks frequently towards flanks and kicks forward at the abdomen .
faeces may be passed in small quantities .
its thick foot - pads help it to walk on loose hot sand without much difficulty .
camel can close his nostrils during sandstorms .
camel possesses extraordinary patience even under conditions of neglect and rough handling .
camel has earned a special reputation for military transport work .
camel is said to do everything for its master except cook his food .
the long hair from the tail is woven into cords and ropes which are noted for their strength and durability .
camel hide is used for saddlery .
the tooth is sealed with a temporary filling .
usually a gold or porcelain crown adds further protection .
the material used to fill your root canal will probably last you a lifetime , but eventually the filling or crown may need to be replaced .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

sensitive teeth
pain from sensitive teeth is not always constant ; it can come and go .
constant pain could be a sign of a more serious problem .
indian breeds of camels
the camels in india are described as plain camels and hill camels , according to the region in which they are bred .
in comparison with the plain camel , the hill camel is the more compact animal with shorter legs , rounder feet and greater muscular development .
the hill camel and the riverine camel are the bagggage type , whereas the desert camel is a riding type of animal .
it has small eyes , short ears , thin skins and small feet .
a good specimen of desert camel can cover long distances , say , 48 kilometres a day comfortably for days on end .
the hill camel is a compact and muscular animal .
the legs are short and the feet are round and hard .
each camel - raising area has its own particular breed named after it , such as bagri , alwar , kachee , jaisalmeri and bikaneri .
the camel has a well - defined season of breeding .
the sexual instincts of the male are suppressed for most of the year .
it comes into rut , commonly known as musth only during winter months , november to february or march .
the actual duration of the rut depends largely on the condition of the animal .
when a number of male camels are kept together , only one or two of the strongest become markedly musth .
the others , out of fear of their stronger companion , do not show any outward sign .
the camel generally stands with hind legs apart , flapping the tail up and down and may even emit semen .
the males should be kept separate from the females during the rutting season .
when a camel is at heavy work and sufficient grazing is not available , it is necessary to feed grain ration .
gram , barley , oats , beans , maize , cottonseeds , and bran are commonly fed to camels .
gram is considered to be the best feed .
grains should preferably be fed in the , evenings .
they should not be fed on an empty stomach or soon after quenching a long thirst .
salt is essential for keeping the camel healthy .
it may be given mixed with daily grain ration or alone .
camels generally work with the nose - rope in single file .
the maximum load in the army is , however , limited to 1.8 quintals .
the distance which may be covered during a day depends on the nature of the road , the pace , and the nourishment available .
a camel under load should not be required to work for more than eight hours a day , and never more than six hours at a stretch .
an average distance for a day ' s march is 19 to 24 kilometres .
a well - looked after camel may easily do 32 kilometres in a day .
camels on the march should be allowed one day ' s rest in a week .
night - marching is often preferable , due to avoidance of the hot sun and to facilitate grazing .
but night - marching should be adopted only when there is sufficient moonlight and grazing is in abundance .
a halt should be made for a few minutes after every twelve to sixteen kilometres to enable the animals to get rest and to urinate .
the act of urination in the male camel takes considerable time .
when deep rivers are to be crossed by swimming , it is best to let the camel cool down by giving him rest before the crossing is made .
great care is necessary in properly loading a baggage camel .
the load should be equally divided and balanced on both sides of the hump .
the saddle or palan should be squarely and evenly adjusted .
the best age to break a camel for riding is three years .
pace must be practised at an early age .
the proper place to tickle a camel is just behind the right leg of the rider .
the tail of a riding camel should be tied to one side by a thin rope fastened to the saddle .
the riding camel is seldom ridden at walk .
after this , it should be allowed sufficient rest .
a well - fed riding camel , on an average , can do 40 kilometres a day without any fatigue .
seasonal clipping of hair
in areas where camels grow a long coat , camel hair is considered valuable for a variety of uses .
the camels are generally clipped in the spring season .
care should be taken to shear as close to the skin as possible and without injuring the animal .
in working camels , the seat of the saddle should be left undipped as a preventive against galls .
the clipped animals should be covered with a blanket in case the nights are cold .
it is a very desirable practice , especially when the winter coat is heavy .
after the application of the oil , the animal should be kept in the shade , as exposure to the sun may sometimes cause blistering .
two days after the application of oil , the whole body is smeared over with mud , which is removed by stripping off after three days .
determining the age of a camel
it is much easier to age a camel than a horse by looking at its teeth .
in a camel , from 8 to 12 days after birth , two central temporary incisors appear .
at the age of 12 months , there are six temporary incisors .
these start wearing at four years of age , and the temporary incisors are nothing but stumps .
at the age of five years , there are two permanent incisors .
at six years there are four permanent incisors , and at seven years there are six permanent incisors .
when the camel is eight years old , the tushes appear .
after the camel is nine years old , the age is determined by the wearing of the tushes and the shape of incisors .
after eleven years , the finding of the age of a camel becomes largely a matter of guess - work .
a fluoride rinse or gel for sensitive teeth , recommended by your dentist .
a sensitivity protection toothpaste usually takes several weeks to ease pain .
follow the instructions of your dental professional on the regular use of sensitivity protection toothpaste to keep pain from returning .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

what are temporomandibular diseases and disorders ( often abbreviated as " tmj " ) ?
after the camel is about twelve years old , the long hair bordering the tail become grey .
camels , like horses , may live to the age of 40 years or more .
the urine is high - coloured and usually scanty .
in females the yield of milk is greatly diminished .
the sick animal prefers to stand facing the sun .
the normal temperature of a camel is 36.1 degrees c ( 97 degrees f ) in the morning .
it rises considerably from dawn to sunset .
at sunset the average temperature is 37.9 degrees c ( 100.3 degrees f ) .
the temperature in camels is taken inside the rectum when the camel is in the sitting position .
an ordinary clinical thermometer is used for the purpose .
the pulse can be felt on the underside of the tail near its roots or about eighteen centimetres above the inner side of the point of the hock .
the normal frequency of respiration in healthy camels at rest is variable from five to twelve per minute .
in cold weather it is less and does not go beyond eight .
in the acute form , the disease runs a rapid course and the animal dies in a few months .
in the chronic form the disease is of long duration and may last three to four years .
cow - camels go dry and if they are in calf , abortion often occurs .
in the case of the chronic form , the typical symptoms are remittent fever , anaemia , and emaciation .
the animal gradually becomes more and more emaciated , till it finally becomes nothing but skin and bones and the hump almost disappears .
the main symptoms of anthraxvare rise in temperature , cessation of rumination , and rapid breathing .
the camel sits down and is unable to rise .
death takes place within a few hours .
the disease is characterised by its rapid course and it may be suspected when sudden deaths occur in animals .
rabies is transmitted to camels by the bites of rabid dogs , jackals and wolves .
the symptoms in the camel may develop from a few days to two months after being bitten by a rabid animal .
the typical symptoms of this disease in camels are aggressiveness , eyes have a queer glassy look , nose is carried high and saliva dribbles from the mouth .
a rabid camel is a great danger to man and beast .
the most common symptoms are lesions on the skin of upper and lower lips .
the affected animals should be segregated and separate attendants should look after them .
gear used for sick animals should be thoroughly disinfected .
elephant is the largest and most majestic of all animals tamed by man .
in hindu mythology , ganesha is depicted as elephant - headed god .
the elephant inhabits the forest districts of india , sri lanka and burma .
it is also found in malay peninsula , thailand , and cochin china , as well as in the islands of sumatra and borneo .
although south - east asia is considered to be the probable original home of this animal , elephants are found in large numbers in africa .
in india , elephants are mostly found along the foot of the himalayas as far west as the valley of dehra dun .
rough estimates indicate that there are about 7,000 wild elephants , of which about 3,000 are believed to be in south india alone .
the elephants have long been captured for domestic uses in india .
in the past , they were mainly used as beasts of burden and for military purposes .
in the wild state , the elephant has always been a great attraction for the hunters of big game .
in india , the elephant was employed in tiger - hunts .
vision , ) in elephants , is acute , but the animal is generally handicapped in making use of his eyes .
the neck being short , does not permit the head to run sideways sufficiently to see objects at the rear .
an elephant , when about to charge , also gives vent to a shrill trumpet .
indian cow - elephants , as a rule , do not have tusks .
the tusks , in elephants , do not correspond to the tusks of a wild boar , but to one of the pairs of incisors .
the tusks arise from the upper jaw , and grow throughout the entire life of the animal .
these are formidable weapons of offence .
they can be brought into use at almost any angle .
they can . otherwise be very usefully employed and enable the animal to perform a variety of work which cannot be undertaken without them .
the longest specimen of tusk recorded is 2.6 metres and the highest weight as 46
usually , the indian elephant has five polished hoof - like nails on the fore feet and four on the hind feet .
unlike horses , the only pace of the elephant is a walk .
a moderately loaded animal can , on a good road , travel nearly five kilometres in an hour .
a ditch about two metres wide and 1.8 metres deep is impassable for him .
elephants attain a much longer age in the wild state than in captivity .
sometimes , extremely exaggerated ages are attributed to elephants .
from 50 to 60 years , it is considered on the decline , while at the age of 70 or 80 , it is a very old animal .
the average age of a circus elephant is about 35 years .
the age of an elephant can be approximately judged by the amount of turn - over of the upper edge of the ear .
in young elephants , sometimes up to the age of eight or nine years , the edge is quite straight .
it then begins to turn over , and by the time an animal is 30 years , the edges curl over to the extent of 2.5 centimetres .
between 30 and 60 years , the turn - over increases to 5 centimetres or slightly more .
teeth also afford some rough evidence as to the age .
roughly speaking , about 2.7 metres should be considered good height for large males , and 2.4 metres for females .
the average height of the circus elephant is 2.2 metres .
there is a general impression that the body of the elephant is incessantly active .
the smaller parts of the body such as tip of the trunk , ears and tail are , however , often in continual activity .
the tail is even more active .
the elephant almost invariably remains standing .
it lies down for relatively a short time only during the night and almost never during the day , except when unusually tired .
it is widely believed that the elephants rarely sleep and if at all , for only a short time .
elephants are valued according to their age and training .
how common are temporomandibular diseases and disorders ?
what are the most common signs and symptoms ?
pain is either episodic or persistent .
symptoms can occur on one or both sides of the face and may include other body pain .
most people have relatively mild symptoms , but a sizable minority goes on to develop persistent pain and severe limitation in jaw motion .
tamed bull - elephants usually come into musth regularly each year and remain in this condition for about three weeks .
it is sometimes described as an instinctive desire in the male elephants to fight and even kill before mating .
the elephant should be chained up and fed very cautiously .
both the males and females have these glands .
there is seldom any evidence of heat in the cow - elephants .
the congress in elephants does not differ much from that of the other domestic quadrupeds .
the bull - elephant uses his trunk to fondle the female and occasionally grasps the cow with it .
the actual copulation lasts only a short time , about one minute or so .
the average gestation period in the female is about 20 months , ranging from 18 to 22 months .
considerable enlargement of the mammary glands may be noticed in a pregnant female .
she doubles up assuming the posture of a defecating dog , with the trunk between forelegs and weight on hind legs .
often a cow - elephant may be seen assuming a recumbent posture during parturition .
the calf is covered with fur all over the body .
in human beings , the weight of the infants is approximately six or seven per cent of the mother ' s weight .
in the case of cows , it is little under eight per cent .
the height of the new - born elephant is about 90 centimetres at the shoulder .
the young one suckles with its mouth .
it soon becomes playful and active .
the calf suckles the dam for about two to three years .
in captivity , the calves are usually weaned at the age of about one and a half years .
composition of elephant milk
milk of the elephant possesses a characteristic taste and odour .
do we know what causes tm problems ?
what should i do if i experience symptoms ?
any lasting pain and / or dysfunction should be properly diagnosed .
if in doubt , seek an independent second opinion .
elephants should be allowed to feed at all times except when at work .
before and after work are no doubt the most appropriate times for supplying fresh fodder .
circus animals are fed five or more times a day .
a full - grown elephant drinks about 190 litres of water daily and requires nearly about 70 litres of water at a time .
the elephant sucks up water with its trunk and then pours it into the throat .
a little neglect may cause loss of a valuable animal .
the amount of work which may be expected from an elephant must necessarily depend upon individual constitution and the type of work .
the elephant is constitutionally a beast of burden .
opinions , however , vary as to the absolute weight an - animal can carry .
the optimum load may average from 450 to 550 kilograms .
during the rains , the legs should be examined for leeches .
to keep an animal waiting for his fodder on coming off work is a very undesirable practice .
when elephants are idle , it is essential that they have daily exercise .
in some cases , the daily journey for fodder will suffice .
elephants need artificial shelter only where good natural shelter is not available .
the best shelter is a grove of evergreen trees with a good drainage .
for elephants working in yards , sheds are necessary .
the elephant should face with head uphill , otherwise if they lie down they might experience great difficulty in rising .
whenever there is any indication of illness , the animal should be given sufficient rest .
during the hot season , a cool and shady place should be provided .
during rainy season , the animal should be protected from getting wet and exposed to cold winds .
coarse and dry fodder should be avoided .
as far as possible , only freshly - cut green fodder should be given .
water should be provided in sufficient quantities and the elephant should not be moved over a long distance for watering .
cominon diseases of elephants
it is an acute and highly infectious disease .
the sick animals should be isolated and the premises should be thoroughly disinfected .
the ancient man was attracted to it both for food and sport .
cock - fighting was known in india over one thousand years before christ .
poultry includes several kinds of birds , such as chicken , ducks , geese , turkeys , and guinea fowls .
in india , of all these birds , the chicken or the domestic fowl is the most important .
it provides a ready source of income to the cultivator .
besides meat and eggs , poultry supplies feathers and rich manure .
both the initial expenditure and the recurrent cost of maintenance of birds are so low that they are within the easy , reach of an average cultivator .
the eggs and the poultry meat are one of the richest sources of proteins and vitamins .
poultry , therefore , offers the most economical and quickest means of increasing the production of high quality protein food in the country .
present position of poultry in india
in india , there were 115.45 million poultry birds , including ducks and others , in 1966 .
this number increased to 160.87 million in 1977 and 207.74 million in 1982 .
according to the livestock census of 1982 , there were 207.74 million poultry birds .
this showed an increase of 29.1 per cent over that of 1977 .
the number of fowls in 1982 was 180.5 million out of which 41 million were estimated to be improved stock .
the standard weight is nearly 4.5 kilograms in cocks and 3.5 kilograms in hens .
chittagong breed of fowls is named after the district in ' which it is largely bred .
there is no standard plumage colouration but the golden and light yellow are most popular .
earlobes and wattles are small and red in colour .
the neck is long and the body is relatively short for its height .
the shanks are yellow in colour and devoid of feathers .
the plumage is sparse at the breast bone .
the hen is a fair layer .
ghagus has a small single or pea - shaped comb .
the throat is loose and baggy .
the legs are rather long , straight and strong .
the usual plumage colouration is red , bay , brown , black and grey .
on the other hand , hens lacking in these desirable characters will cause disappointment .
poor layers utilize most of their feed for purposes of maintaining the body .
if it is intended to produce birds for poultry meat industry , the selection should be limited to fast growing chickens .
for commercial success , the most safe and economical course is to keep only one or at the most two selected breeds .
specialization in a few breeds is better than to keep a large variety of breeds .
in a well managed flock , both the operations , selection and culling , are equally important .
there are two systems of keeping poultry geaerally practised in india , the semi - intensive system and the intensive system .
in the villages , this system is considered most convenient .
they can also have easy access to grasses and insects which are their natural food .
a fowl has no sweat glands to regulate its body temperature .
under the semi - intensive system , an area of 230 square metres is required to keep 50 layers .
a shed of suitable size should be provided in the yard .
will my insurance cover tmj claims ?
controversy exists over whether tmj is a dental or medical condition .
presently , diagnostic criteria as well as many treatments lack scientific validation .
what research needs to be done on " tmj " ?
details of the workshop and extensive information on tmj can be found at the groups web site , www . tmj . org .
this can cause crowding or displacement of other teeth , or lead to the development of localized tooth decay , infection , or gum disease .
the litter should be started at least two months before the onset of rain and never during the wet weather .
after the rainy season is over , add more litter material gradually in order to bring its thickness to 15 to 20 centimetres by the end of november .
keeping the litter dry is essential for the success of the whole system .
minimum floor space required per bird of light breeds is 28 square decimetres for a flock of 100 birds .
in the case of heavy breeds , the floor space should be 32 square decimetres per bird .
this tray is supported on the frame .
the water troughs ' and mash hoppers can be provided one each for a cage or one for three to four cages collectively .
each cage should have an height of 45 centimetres , width 45 centimetres , and length 35 to 40 centimetres .
like incubation of eggs , the chicks may be reared under a hen or artificially under a brooder , commonly known as foster mother .
brooding period is from a day old to eight weeks and is by far the most delicate part of the chicken ' s life .
desi hens , as a rule , are ideal mothers .
an average - sized hen can conveniently brood 10 to 15 chicks .
in nature , the mother hen supplies the heat to the chicks by means of her own body and feathers .
till the age of about six to eight weeks , the sex signs in chickens are not clearly indicated .
at about eight weeks , the comb and wattles in males are well developed , whereas in females they are much less conspicuous .
the females , as a rule , are usually better feathered , especially along the back , than the males .
recently , it has been made possible to do sexing of one - day old chicks with fairly good accuracy by the japanese vent method .
a considerable amount of training and experience is , however , necessary before one can practise this method with some degree of accuracy .
hens that have laid eggs for more than one year , usually show a marked decrease in egg production .
it is , therefore , advisable to dispose of the hens each year and start with a new batch of pullets .
light stimulates birds to eat more feed and to lay more eggs .
debeaking is commonly practised when chicks are 10 to 14 days of age to stop excessive pecking , particularly if the birds are kept in confinement .
the flavour of eggs depends to some extent on the nature of the feed .
green foods and yellow maize tend to give good coloured yolk .
as a rule , good coloured yolk is rich in vitamins and is superior to pale yolk .
the yolk contains about 16 per cent protein and the white about 10 per cent protein of their own weights .
because of the abundance and the ideal proportions of essential amino - acids , the proteins of egg - white and yolk are of very high nutritive value .
when the whole egg is consumed , the individual proteins supplement one another very satisfactorily .
young chicks get into the habit of pecking at toes , combs , vents and feathers of other birds .
this vice is more common in the birds which are kept under conditions of overcrowding , unbalanced diet and lack of exercise .
de - tipping of the beak of the affected bird is generally practised .
de - tipped birds can take food and water but not peck at others .
birds should be regularly examined for internal worms and external parasites .
coccidiosis is a common disease of young birds , usually between the age of 2 and 12 weeks .
mortality rate is very high .
the general symptoms are blood - stained diarrhoea , listlessness and ruffled appearance .
the affected birds huddle together in a corner .
fowl - pox is a highly contagious disease .
duck eggs are heavier than hen eggs , and weigh from 70 to 84 grams each .
there were 16.24 million ducks in india , in 1982 .
among ducks , there are three main types of breeds , namely , meat , egg - laying and ornamental .
important breeds of indian ducks are sylhet mete and nageswari .
sylhet mete is the ordinary duck , commonly found in the villages of eastern india .
it is light brown in colour with black tips on feathers and yellow beak .
when in full feather , the duck has a blue neck and head .
brush carefully the day after surgery .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

a diabetic clinic was set up in 1960 at the all india institute of medical sciences , new delhi .
text of instructions like commandments of religious puritanism , strict rituality and hardline discipline have been overbearing in many diabetic clinics .
the average yield of eggs varies from 80 to 150 per duck .
the colour of the egg is white .
the average weight of the egg is about 56 grams .
the back and most of the body of these birds are black , while the breast and throat are white in colour .
under farm conditions , a duck of this type lays 80 to 150 eggs a year .
the colour of the egg is pale blue .
the average weight of an egg is about 56 grams .
an adult bird weighs nearly two kilograms .
the growing and laying birds should be fed good ration .
ducks drink a lot of water along with the mash .
clean fresh water should always be provided to them .
for breeding , one drake is allowed for every five or six ducks .
ducks usually lay their eggs at night and in the morning .
eggs of the common duck take 28 days to hatch .
in the case of eggs of the muscovy duck , the incubation period is 35 days .
usually they are incubated the same way as hen eggs .
an average sized goose can take about fifteen eggs for hatching .
a flock of ten geese would need a floor space of nine square metres .
in healthy geese , the normal temperature is 42.0 degrees c ( 107.6 degrees f ) .
respiration per minute is 20 to 25 .
the rate of heart beat is 110 per minute .
they are mainly reared for meat .
british white ( white holland ) and beltsville white are popular breeds in western countries .
the management of diabetes is ' art of the possible ' .
claims for indigenous methods of therapy are being prospectively evaluated .
diabetic care needs patience , compassion , optimism and time from the physician .
patient must be actively involved in his own management and should develop confidence to bring about adjustment in day - to - day managements .
this book attempts to provide information on such principles , though the care of each diabetic still needs to be individualised .
the law is on your side if you have good cause for complaint .
your legal rights
it is an offence for a supplier to sell goods unless they are safe .
prompt action may help prevent accident of injury to other customers .
buying goods
you have the same rights even if you lose your receipt .
a receipt , however , is useful evidence of where and when you bought the goods .
only the buyer has the statutory rights described earlier .
you are not legally obliged to return faulty goods to the seller at your own expense .
if an item is bulky and would be difficult or expensive to return to the shop , ask the seller to collect it .
it is up to the courts to decide if a term is unfair .
alternatively , you can write to the director general of fair trading who will , similarly , consider whether a term is unfair .
making a complaint
when you complain , get your facts right and always keeping calm .
you are more likely to get matters resolved if you do not lose your temper .
see the last page for details of the leaflet ' no credit ? '
some loans are only given if they are secured on your home .
these are not available if you rent .
a secured loan gives security to the lender , not to you .
you might get a lower rate of interest with a secured loan but you could have a lot at stake .
right to cancel
if you change your mind and want to cancel a credit deal , you should be all right if ;
the deal was made within the last few days ; and
you talked to the lender or supplier in person ( not on the telephone ) ; and
when you sign , you should be given a copy of the credit agreement , which sets out your cancellation rights .
you should also receive , by post , a second copy or notice of your cancellation rights .
if you can cancel , there should be a cancellation box on your copy of the agreement telling you what to do .
act quickly , as there are tight time limits .
if you change your mind and the lender has not yet signed the agreement , you have the right to withdraw from a credit deal .
any goods you were buying through a credit agreement will have to go back .
it is the shop ' s responsibility to collect them .
make sure you keep them in good condition until they are taken away .
credit brokers ' fees
extra protection
buying on credit gives you some extra rights , for example , if goods are faulty .
if a trader has an arrangement with a finance or credit card company to allow you to pay by credit , you have extra protection .
this applies if the goods cost more than 100 .
the credit company is equally liable for any claim you have against the trader .
it is sensible to approach the trader first .
you can , however , make a claim against the credit card issuer or finance company without doing this .
settling up early
you may find that part way through repaying your loan , you have enough money to pay off the whole amount owing in one go .
even so , settling early will cost less than carrying on with the repayments plus interest for the full length of the loan .
goods on order from a shop
if you do not need the goods by a specific time , you could ask for an estimated delivery date .
but even if you do not agree a delivery date the seller must deliver in a reasonable time .
say that if an item has not come within a certain period ( 14 days might be reasonable ) you want your money back .
when you order something , you and the seller should agree a fixed price .
you may agree that if the cost of the goods goes up before delivery , you will pay the increase .
whatever the situation , make sure you know where you stand , preferably in writing .
goods should be delivered within a reasonable time , usually 28 days or as specified in the advertisement .
if the goods do not turn up you can cancel the order and ask for the money back .
but if you agree to allow the seller extra time , you cannot cancel until that time is up .
the law allows you a reasonable time to examine the goods .
do this as soon as you can and if they are faulty send them back immediately with a note explaining the problem .
keep a copy of your note .
it is also advisable to get a proof of postage certificate from the post office .
most mail order catalogues have special arrangements for the return of goods .
in other cases , the company should reimburse you for the cost of returning the goods .
if you order through an advertisement read it thoroughly before placing an order and keep a copy .
if you have to send cash , send it by registered post .
if ordering from a book or record club , make sure you know what commitment you are making .
you can write to the publication ' s advertising manager for help .
many mail order companies belong to trade associations which may offer ways of resolving problems .
if you receive goods through the post that you have not ordered , you do not have to accept them .
write to the firm explaining that you do not want the goods .
if they are not collected within 30 days , they become yours .
a firm which demands payment for unsolicited goods could be breaking the law .
if you come across this problem contact your local trading standards department .
some people are happy to receive the offers for goods or services which come through the letterbox .
think twice before you pay anything for goods and services before you receive them .
if it is local , make sure it is listed in the telephone book .
ask the firm if it belongs to a trade association which runs a scheme to protect prepayments .
if you do pay anything in advance make sure you get a receipt showing the name and address .
if you pay a deposit and then cancel the order , the firm could claim to be entitled to keep your deposit .
check whether deposits are returnable , and , if so , in precisely what circumstances .
if you use a credit card to pay a deposit for goods or services costing more than 100 , you normally have more protection .
guarantees give you additional rights which may be a useful back up if you have to complain .
with some goods you may have manufacturers ' guarantees .
for the guarantee to be effective you may need to ensure that you return the registration card to a stated address .
later this substance was chemically identified as insulin , a hormone that primarily regulates carbohydrate metabolism in the body .
thus , as the present concept evolves , diabetes is not a single disease but a syndrome .
diabetes is a condition in which thebody cannot process certain foods properly because the supply and efficiency of the hormone , insulin , is not adequate .
the pancreas , a gland that lies behind the stomach , produces the hormone , insulin .
diabetes results from a problem with the way the body handles certain foods .
almost everything that one eats or drinks is digested , or broken down , and sent along to various parts of the body in the bloodstream .
there are different uses for different kinds of foods .
some problem sectors
buying new and used cars
decide on what you want and how much you can afford .
add on estimates of running costs , insurance , tax , mot , petrol , repairs and servicing .
if you are taking out a loan , add on the repayments .
look for a reputable dealer - ask the advice of friends and look for a trade association sign .
this should mean that the dealer follows the requirements of the code of practice for the motor industry , which could be helpful if you have a complaint .
the price
do not be afraid to haggle over the price .
if you are not clear about any part of the deal , ask for an explanation .
get it in writing if you are still not happy .
buying a new car
the final price will usually reflect the number of options you want on the car .
there may be offers included with the car such as insurance or extended warranties .
if the car is more than three years old , it must have an mot certificate and this must show the mileage at the time of the last test .
you could ask to see this too .
in fact , a reputable dealer should be pleased to confirm the car ' s history to a potential buyer .
beware a dealer who is cagey about a car ' s history .
car magazines often provide a range of advice on what to look and listen for when on a test drive .
is the dealer content to have the car tested by the aa or rac before you buy ?
if the car is in for a regular service , make sure you know what this include .
tell the garage if you want the manufacturer ' s recommended service carried out , and agree between you whether any items can be left out .
if you are faced with a sky - high bill or think the garage has done a bad job , talk to the manager straight away .
if the problem cannot be resolved , you will probably still have to pay the disputed bill to get your car back
in diabetes , carbohydrates are the key .
carbohydrates provide the body ' s cells with fuel for heat and energy .
after a meal , glucose circulates in the bloodstream . meanwhile , glucose enters the cells that are constituents of the body and its tissues .
it is the source of energy for the body to carry on its activities .
it helps the glucose or blood sugar to enter the body ' s cells providing them with energy .
it is also involved with the storage of reserve supplies of glucose in the muscles and liver .
home maintenance and improvements
there are always repair maintenance and improvement jobs to be done in the home .
if you are not a diy expert you will have to find a reliable contractor
a few sensible precautions taken at the outset could mean the difference between money well spent or money wasted .
choosing a contractor
choose your contractor with care .
ask friends and neighbours whom they recommend and draw up a list setting out exactly what you want done .
but be careful if there is an associated credit agreement - it may be a good idea to get advice .
if it is a large job you might be asked for stage payments for work done .
follow the suggested procedure on pages 23 - 24 for complaining about a service .
you can find the names and addresses of relevant trade associations from your local library or citizens advice bureau .
this does not mean that the company cannot fail , but it is less likely to .
you should look for the atol number in brochures and on invoices .
this is the case even if the travel firm goes out of business before your holiday begins or while you are away .
if taking out travel insurance is a condition of taking the holiday you have no right to opt out of that requirement .
high concentration fluoride gels , mouth rinses , drops and tablets may be recommended by your dentist .
your dentist may recommend at home fluoride treatments to reverse the decay process .
tooth decay often begins on biting surfaces , between the teeth , and on exposed roots .
use of fluoridated toothpaste can help prevent tooth decay at its early stage .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

consumer education is a top priority .
promoting customer service
working with business , consumer groups and local authorities , the government has drawn up core principles for effective codes of practice .
more help for business
a power for the courts to ban from trading for a period of time those traders with a history of disregarding their legal obligations
the power to seek injunctions and banning orders will be made available to local authorities as well as the oft .
a modern trading standards service
the government wants to see the trading standards service in local government strengthened to meet the expectations of consumers and business .
develop clear performance measures which encourage local accountability
the government wants consumers to have a powerful voice .
it also wants to see effective consumer representation .
the government will ensure that :
consumers ' views are sought before decisions are taken on relevant industrial , trade and social policy issues .
a consumer advisory group will report directly to ministers
the government is giving the oft new opportunities to develop its role as a consumer watchdog .
the national consumer council ( ncc ) is well placed to speak for consumers on major issues .
the government will help relaunch the ncc as a dynamic and even more effective force in uk consumer affairs .
the body then has to get its energy from its fat and protein tissues .
if your child is registered as a pupil at a particular school , that school must give permission for your child to be absent .
if your child does not go to the school at which he or she is registered , the relevant education authority can take legal action against you .
why must my child go to school regularly ?
having a good education will help to give your child the best possible start in life .
if your child does not attend school regularly , he or she will not be able to keep up with the work .
employers will want to be sure that the people they are thinking of taking on are reliable .
so children who have not attended their school regularly have less chance of getting a good job .
young people who are off school for no good reason are at risk of becoming victims of crime or abuse .
local education authorities ( leas ) are responsible , by law , for making sure that registered pupils of compulsory school age attend their school regularly .
if your child is not attending school regularly , an education welfare officer may visit you .
this means that the court appoints a supervisor to help and give advice to you and your child .
this could result in you and your partner being fined up to 1000 for each child who is not going to school .

what every parent should know
in this document , we refer to ' your child ' .
this will be for allpupils and parents , not just new pupils .
there are many ways you can help your child in school .
by law you are responsible for making sure he or she goes to school regularly , and on time .
but you can also help by supporting the school ' s rules , and its arrangements for homework .
make sure your child knows that you support the school ' s policies .
ask your child ' s teachers how you can help your child at school .
let them know about anything else you would like them to tell you .
good behaviour and discipline in school pupils should come from a partnership between home and school .
doing homework helps children to develop important skills , in particular those of independent learning .
the government recommends regular homework for all children from year 1 upwards .
young children should start by reading or sharing a book with you for short periods of time .
we have asked all schools to draw up a written statement of their policy on homework , consulting parents .
the amount of homework recommended in the guidelines , in broad terms , is shown below .
primary
( reading , spelling , other literacy work and number work )
children are not expected to do too much on one day and not enough on another ;
the tasks they are set are realistic within the time available ;
if you have not seen the school ' s policy , ask for a copy .
some women develop a different type of diabetes during pregnancy , which may turn into type ii diabetes some years later .
but it is very difficult to separate racial and ethnic factors from genetic factors .
physical activity seems to make the available insulin work better .
the agreement may also tell you the school will consult you about any changes to homework arrangements .
good communication between the school and the home is essential .
for example , you should know when to expect a written report on your child ' s progress .
how will i be involved ?
schools will have different ways of consulting you .
ask your child ' s school how they will consult you .
what do i need to think about when giving the school my views ?
you might want to think about :
what the school tells you and what you need to know ;
what can the school do to help you help your child ; and
the school will ask you to sign the agreement to show that you understand and accept it .
they might also ask your child to sign if he or she is old enough to understand it .
what happens if i , or my child , break the agreement ?
the school should not discipline or exclude your child simply because you , or your child , have broken the agreement .
national year of reading - a little reading goes a long way
it gives simple step - by - step advice to help parents and carers discover the joys of reading and writing with their children .
and finally . . .
it is important that you have your say .

helping with your children ' s reading
learning at home
young children watch what adults do and learn by copying them .
reading is no different , but they must want to learn to read .
it will help if they can see others enjoying reading themselves .
boys , in particular , need to know that reading is important , and fathers and grandfathers reading to them can help .
seeing adults reading from books , newspapers , recipes or menus will make children want to read for themselves .
your child will gain a lot from spending time with you talking and listening , reading and writing .
most children will try hard to please you and will want to do well .
best of all , sharing the fun of reading is a great experience for children and adults .
first steps
babies love words and language .
from the start , the time you spend reading with your children will make books and stories come alive .
board books and bath books are often the first books children will come across .
children often want to listen to the same story again and again .
this is fine , as it builds confidence and familiarity with words , and reinforces that stories are fun .
a few minutes of special , quiet time with a book every day is much more valuable than half an hour a week .
join your local library
no child is too young to join the library .
it is free , and borrowing books is free .
there are hundreds of brightly coloured books to choose from for readers of all ages , from babies to teenagers .
most children learn to read by putting letters together that match up with the sounds that they remember hearing .
they learn the sounds that letters make .
they learn how letters join together to make words .
words do n ' t just belong in books .
help and encouragement
ask your child ' s teachers for advice and ideas about how you can help with reading and writing .
ask other mums and dads ( including your own ) for tips .
the next step
sharing stories with a grown - up will teach them new words and will encourage them to become better readers .
allow your child to re - read favourite and familiar stories , or to hear you re - read them .
buy books as presents instead of toys .
the librarians will be able to give helpful advice to adults who want to choose books for their children .
also , keep your eyes open for book and storytelling events taking place in the library .
children are often eager to write .
writing often follows on from drawing and from the child ' s reading .
children like to be able to write their names , to label drawings or to write a story to go with a picture .
they learn about reading through their writing , having to think about the sound and how words look .
you can help them by doing the following :
get young children used to making the shapes of letters by joining dots or using a pen to go over shapes you ' ve drawn in pencil .
at the beginning , do n ' t worry too much about untidy writing .
use lower case rather than capitals .
children find it easier to practise the patterns of the letters that way .
word banks
you can make a word box filled with words your child uses most and which you can add new words to .
or , your child can make their own lists of common , popular , difficult and new words .
lots of children find spelling hard .
you can help them by doing the following :
spell out words with fridge magnets , or letter tiles from word games .
take some letters out and get your child to put the right ones back in the right places .
play games with lists of words .
think up harder versions as your child learns more !
get them to play at rearranging letters to make other words ( anagrams ) out of their name , or other words they know .
practice looking up words together and sharing the dictionary .
whenever you ' re reading together , make sure your child feels ok and is comfortable .
use books with pictures , and later , with pictures and words .
picture books help children match the pictures to the words .
start with simple words .
no book handy ? do n ' t worry !
you probably wo n ' t run out of ideas !

you can find out more about the national year of reading by visiting the department ' s web site at : / reading
parents as partners
this leaflet is for parents of children in infant , primary and junior schools .
we are sending it to you as part of the national literacy strategy .
this national government initiative aims to raise standards of reading and writing for all children .
of course , parents are very important partners in helping children with reading and writing .
this leaflet :
sets out some of the main things we know about how children learn to read and write
explains why lessons are planned in this way
asks for your help in supporting reading and writing at home
reading , writing , talking and listening are a key part of what children learn in their first years at school .
all the learning they do at home with you and at school with their teachers , helps children to :
enjoy talking about what they read and telling us what they think
find things out by reading - from stories , information books , catalogues or newspapers . . .
learn new words
spell words correctly and write clearly
read and write confidently
children learn to read best when they have many ways of working out the meaning .
the shapes of letters and words ( that they recognise by sight )
the meaning ( what will come next . . . )
the more opportunities children have , at school and at home , to enjoy reading , the sooner they begin to be confident about it .
your child may tell you about the literacy hour , and what happens in it .
all the time in the literacy hour is spent on reading and writing .
there is a literacy hour every day of the week .
whole class about 10 minutes reporting back and thinking about what has been learned
whole class about 15 minutes shared reading or writing
whole class about 15 minutes word work , sentence work
whole class - shared reading and writing
with young children the teacher works with the whole class for the first half hour .
he or she may begin by reading with all the children , using a ' big book ' .
first she will read the book aloud , and point to the words and pictures . then she will read it again and the children will join in .
the teacher will ask questions and encourage the children to think about what they read .
questions might be :
where is the title of the book ?
why was that part funny ?
what do you think it will be about ?
to know that the words go from left to right
to see where one word ends and the next word begins
to recognise letters and words
to hear the sounds of letters
to recognise words or sounds that rhyme
to know about full stops , commas and other punctuation .
group work
in the next part of the hour , the class is split up into groups of four to six children .
whole group
for the last part of the literacy hour the teacher works with the whole class again .
why have a literacy hour ?
because reading and writing are so important , it makes sense to give them a set time , every day .
when will the teacher hear my child read ?
what do older children do in the literacy hour ?
as children become independent readers and writers , they still spend an hour every day on reading and writing .
they work on more complex books .
they draft and edit their writing .
this might be a news article , a set of instructions , a description , a letter or a story .
yes .
and there are times when they can do more reading , or finish a piece of writing .
how will i know what progress my child is making ?
your child ' s teacher will talk with you about your child ' s progress in reading and writing .
she will also set targets .
for example , for a young child this might be :
to learn five letters of the alphabet
to tell the story in their own words .
to explain what a person in a story is like
to write in paragraphs
to learn how to spell a number of words
to take notes as they watch a video .
your child ' s school will let you know what your child is working towards , and ask you to help by :
practising with them to help them reach their target
praising them when they reach it .
send books home and ask you to read them with your child
ask parents to help in school
hold meetings or courses for parents who want to know more
reading and writing at home
young children learn a great deal from you about reading and writing , before they start school .
they learn to talk and listen to what you say .
they learn about looking at books , asking questions about the story and starting to write .
when they go to school , the help you give them is just as important .
the more chances your child has to enjoy reading and writing at home , the better . little and often works well .
with young children it helps to :
talk about the story together
let them see you reading and writing
help them to read signs and labels when you ' re out together
you could :
let them read on - then they may be able to work out the word
point to a picture , if this helps them with the meaning
give them the first or last sound and see if they can read the word
read the word for them .
you could read along with them .
if they are stuck , first :
pause , then
prompt , then ,
encourage them to talk about the ideas in the story .
with older children it helps to :
encourage them to read ' everyday ' print - in diy manuals , tv guides , catalogues
give them plenty of chances for writing - in notebooks , diaries , scrapbooks , or on a computer
help at home gives children the best start in reading and writing
teaching children road safety
parents !
your child ' s best road safety teacher is you
why ?
because basic road safety can best be taught in the street .
your child is out and about with you .
he or she will follow your example , good or bad
please do n ' t wait for the school to teach your child road safety .
get your child to practise judging the speed and distance of approaching vehicles on a busy road and identifying safe gaps .
stress that they should never blindly follow others across the road .
they must always think for themselves .
many of them think they ' know it all ' .
road safety at school
1 . stop at the kerb at the crossing .
if there is a button , press it and wait for the green man .
2 . when the traffic has stopped , walk across , but keep looking and listening .
always cross on the stripes , or between the studs on a crossing with a red and green man .
do n ' t cross on the zig - zag markings , as many accidents happen close to crossings .
3 . if there is an island in the middle of the crossing treat each half of the road as a separate crossing .
stop at the island and wait for the traffic on the other side to stop before you continue .
teach your child to be a good passenger .
this will help to protect them from serious injury .
it is not safe to carry a child on your lap or to carry two people in one seat belt .
never use a rear facing child restraint in the front seat of a car fitted with a passenger air bag .
the right one depends on the weight , size and age of your child .
phone 0870 122 6236 or contact your local authority road safety officer .
otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions .
move to a space where find a safe place to drivers can see you clearly .
1 . think first
find a safe place to cross then stop
stand where you can see if anything is coming .
3 . use your eyes and ears
traffic could come from any direction .
also listen , because you can sometimes hear traffic before you see it .
look all around again
look all around again and listen .
5 . look and listen again
when there ' s no traffic near walk straight across the road
this can lead to a change in the bite , the loss of additional teeth , decay and gum disease .
dental implants can be an effective method to replace one tooth or several teeth .
the process requires surgery and may take up to a year to complete .
several steps are usually necessary to place an implant .
the placement of a single - tooth endosteal implant is illustrated below :
a metal anchor , or artificial root is placed into the jawbone .
bone grows around the anchor .
if you would like more time to comment , you should talk to the named officer .

but above all - it must be safe .
by carefully analysing each step of the catering operation , anything which might affect the safety of the food is identified .
assured safe catering helps prevent safety problems by careful planning in easy steps .
biological ; eg salmonella in chicken ;
physical ; eg glass in food of any kind ;
chemical ; eg cleaning chemicals in any kind of food .
the diagram below shows the stages to go through to set up an assured safe catering system .
this can be applied to any size of catering business .
stage 3 draw a flow chart of the operation showing the catering steps
stage 4 for each catering step :
1 ) list hazards
2 ) identify controls
3 ) determine critical control points
6 ) check
stage 6 full screen check
with the first step work through stages 4 ( a ) to 4 ( f ) before moving on to the next step on the flow chart .
stage 4 ( a ) : listing the hazards .
remember : a hazard is anything that may cause harm to a customer .
stage 4 ( b ) : identify the control measures .
you must be able to carry out the control measures in the kitchen where they are to be operated , otherwise you may not be able to use them .
stage 4 ( c ) : critical control points
you should control the hazards shown in the critical control points chart .
you will need to identify the critical control points that apply to your operation .
there may be other critical control points in your operation that are not shown in the chart .
stage 4 ( d ) : decide how to check and if necessary record that the controls have been applied .
checking : keep the methods you use to check as simple as possible , e . g .
check that all equipment , eg knives and chopping boards , is cleaned before it is used .
records will also give useful information if there is a query from a environmental health officer or a customer .
stage 4 ( e ) : putting the system into action
you will need to prepare any necessary record sheets .
you may need to produce instructions for controls and checking procedures for staff to refer to .
what is to be done ;
how it is to be done ;
when it is to be done ;
where it is to be done ;
who is to do it .
make sure all staff know and understand what they have to do so that the system works properly .
once you have the system in place for the first step of the operation , check it through to make sure that :
the checking of the critical control points is satisfactory .
you may now move on to the stage of the operation as shown on the flow chart .
you should carry out the same procedures from 4 ( a ) to 4 ( f ) for this step in the operation .
stage 6 : full system check
being checked as often as necessary ;
accompanied by adequate instructions .
stage 7 : full system review
reviews may be needed :
from time to time to see that the system is working .
assured safe catering will help you , your business , and your customers .
before a doctor or other health professional examines or treats you , they need your consent .
sometimes you can simply tell them whether you agree with their suggestions .
if you later chang your mind , you ' re entitled to withdraw consent - even after signing .
what should i know before deciding ?
should i ask questions ?
should i ask questions ?
always ask anything you want .
to support you and prompt questions , you might like to bring a friend or relative .
ask if you ' d like someone independent to speak up for you .
is there anything i should tell people ?
if there ' s any procedure you do n ' t want to happen , you should tell the people treating you .
can i find out more about giving consent ?
ask for one from your clinic or hospital , order one from the nhs responseline ( 08701 555 455 ) or read it on the web site
who is treating me ?
someone senior will supervise - either in person accompanying a less experienced doctor in training or available to advise someone more experienced .
you ' ll also have an opportunity to talk with the anaesthetist when he or she assesses your state of health shortly before treatment .
will samples be taken ?
some kinds of operation involve removing a part of the body ( such as a gall bladder or a tooth ) .
you would always be told about this in advance .
other operations may mean taking samples as part of your care .
these samples may be of blood or small sections of tissue , for example of an unexplained lump .
such samples may be further checked by other health professionals to ensure the best possible standards .
again , you should be told in advance if samples are likely to be taken .
the nhs trust treating you will have a local system for checking whether you ' re willing for this to happen .
the use of photographs and recordings is also extremely important for other nhs work , such as teaching or medical research .
what if things do n ' t go as expected ?
amongst the 25,000 operations taking place every day , sometimes things do n ' t go as they should .
what are the key things to remember ?
when am i likely to be able to get back to work ?
will i need long - term care ?
will my mobility be affected ?
will i still be able to drive ?
will it affect the kind of work i do ?
will it affect my personal / sexual relationships ?
will i be able to take part in my favourite sport / exercises ?
will i be able to follow my usual diet ?
it happens while they ' re asleep and is always sudden and unexpected .
because no one yet knows why cot death happens , there ' s no sure way to prevent it .
studies have shown that by taking a few simple precautions , you can reduce the risk .
why not keep this leaflet next to where your baby sleeps so everyone knows what to do .
sleeping position
recent research shows that cot death is more common in babies who go to sleep on their tummies .
by making sure your baby goes to sleep in the right position you can reduce the risk of cot death .
at the same time , the levels of fats and proteins in the bloodstream rise .
these blood fats and proteins , over time , can affect the walls of blood vessels and also lead to some serious problems .
another major reason for treating diabetes is that the disease can affect the circulatory or cardiovascular system ( heart and blood vessels ) .
lack of exercise may as well influence these risk factors .
the possibility for vascular disease also proportionately increases with age .
approaches in treatment while diabetes ca n ' t be cured , it can be controlled and there are different ways to do it .
babies should be laid down to sleep :
a ) on their backs or ;
b ) on their sides , with the lower arm forward to stop them rolling over .
do n ' t be worried that babies might be sick and choke if laid on their backs .
there is no evidence that this happens .
some babies who require special care or who have particular medical problems need to be nursed on their tummies .
your doctor , nurse or midwife will explain why .
for babies who have been sleeping on their tummies , try them on their backs or sides .
but they may not like the change and find it difficult to settle .
if this happens then it is probably wise not to upset them by insisting on the new position .
create a smoke - free zone for your baby .
do not smoke anywhere near the baby .
better still do not smoke at all .
if your baby seems unwell seek medical advice early and quickly .
remember it is comparatively rare , so do not let the fear of cot death spoil the first months with your baby .

discharge from hospital
since april 1993 there have been changes in the way social care is financed and provided .
they will do this both by providing some services themselves and by buying in care from a variety of private ad voluntary providers .
this will give more choice and flexibility to users and the people who care for them .
who will get the help
how to get help
someone will come to see you in hospital to find out more about you and what you would like to see happen .
they will also talk to people who provide care for you : hospital staff , your family and your friends , and your gp .
if you are not a manchester resident but are in hospital in the city , manchester social services department will make arrangements for you to be assessed .
if you require more information contact your ward nurse who will be able to help .
the addresses and phone numbers of manchester social services department offices are given over the page .
life - do n ' t keep it to yourself
organ donation can be a difficult subject to think or talk about .
most people do not want to contemplate their own death .
nor do bereaved relatives find it easy to decide on the donation of the organs of a loved one who has just died .
but far more patients could be saved if there were more donor organs available .
recipients are chosen on the grounds of need and by blood group and , if necessary , by tissue characteristics .
there is a waiting list for organ transplants because the demand exceeds the supply .
who can be an organ donor ?
anyone could be a donor .
but , for the major organs , it is only these people who have suffered serious accidents ( mostly head injuries ) who actually become donors .
the doctors involved in your treatment will not be the ones interested in organ donation .
in any case , the prime concern of all doctors and nurses is for their living patients and they will make every attempt to save their patients ' lives .
only after they are satisfied that nothing more can be done will the question of organ donation be raised .
will i really be dead when they remove my organs ?
you can probably think of other examples .
if the issue is raised with your children , express honestly both the pleasures and the problems of that time of your life .
if drug use is discussed in appropriate contexts it may lose some of its attraction as a secretive and mysterious thing to do .
why do young people take drugs ?
what can you do about it ?
everyone is individual and will have their own particular reasons for using drugs .
parents try to deal with drug use by their children will need to make sure that they do n ' t jump to conclusions .
similarly , drugtaking may be a response to loneliness , feeling inadequate or lacking self - esteem or confidence .
teenagers often have problems with their self - image and may need reassurance from parents that they are loved .

the diet prescription for a diabetic has the following com - ponents :
diet constituents , carbohydrates , fats , proteins ; and functional caloric distribution of different meals .
similarly for a pregnant woman extra allowance is called for .
for an obese person , a deficit of approximately 500 calories per day permits loss of weight of about one pound a week .
food constituents different kinds of foods are available for one ' s daily consumption .
the major rood categories , are carbohdrates , proteins and fats , although most foods contain two or more categories .
for example , eggs and most cheeses are about half protein and half fat .
therefore , one should cut down on foods that are high in cholesterol .
these foods include eggs , liver and other organ meats , and certain kinds of shellfish .
saturated fats include animal fats , such as butter , cream , and bacon .
a wide variety of vitamins and minerals are essential for proper nutrition .
some foods contain a lot of one kind , while others have small amounts of several kinds .
fibre and bulk : all foods that come from plants have natural fibres .
in other words , they may make the body ' s own insulin work better .
recently a new generation of these agents has become available which are most potent and have less side - effects .
when diet alone is not enough , oral agents may be added or insulin injections may be required .
the decision is based on a number of factors and an experienced physician can advise on this issue .
blood dyscrasias and jaundice are rare .
in case of chlorpropamide , especially with high dosage , three other side - effects are known :
oral agents do not replace diets .
oral agents have to be continued even though blood glucose has been normalised .
secondary failure to drug may ensue after a year or so .
all such patients who have the risk of ketoacidosis or coma need insulin therapy .
insulin potency is measured in units .
aspirin ( salicylates ) , tricyclic compounds ( anti - depressants ) or chloroquin ( anti - malarial ) may augment blood glucose lowering effect .
drugs or agents used for psychotro - phic effects may as well be used by diabetics .
the effect on blood glucose and differentbodysystemsaresummarised as follows :
drugs of abuse that impair diabetes management alcohol primarily decreases blood glucose level .
caffeine ( coffee , tea , cola drinks ) in large amounts increases blood glucose .
sedatives ( hypnotics ) can impair thinking and thus self - control ,
thiazide diuretics , contraceptives or anabolic steroids will worsen metabolic control .
these episodes may have insidious onset , may be prolonged and may sometimes recur even after taking some glucose .
reduces body fat and increases tone of the muscle tissues .
muscle cells use more glucose than fat cells .
individuals with this type of fat distribution are more likely to have high insulin levels .
is an adjunct to diet to assist in weight reduction .
risks injuries to feet are likely especially if nerve damage is present .
coronary heart attack is a possibility if prior screening is not done .
once there is indes more of suspicion , diagnosis is not difficult .
special problems of the management of diabetes in childhood include the following : '
the main objective is to create an environment and liasion so that child can very freely communicate with the health care team .
the expectations from this child have to be realistic for the age ability .
many adults maintain the same weight for years without effort .
they eat to relieve their feelings of despair , to compensate emotionally for a feeling of insecurity , frustration or lack of affection .
a few people become overweight due to an endocrine or hormonal disorder .
correct diagnosis and its treatment can reverse this status to normalcy .
to increase fibre complex carbohydrates as fresh fruits , vegetables and coarse cereals .
suggested steps for control of hyperlipidaemia are as follows :
this status or eventuality should be understood by all diabetics especially those on insulin treatment . sick - day rules should be learnt explicitly by all such individuals .
ii . vascular disease the risk factors for vascular disease in diabetes include the following :
wash hands well with soap and water .
preferably use disposable syringes that are now available in india ( steps 3,4,5 , are not essential ) .
4 . take up the syringe once again . by pulling back the plunger , take air into the syringe equal to the dose of insulin required .
7 . take the needle out of the bottle .
during sickness one should take temperatures six hourly . the readings should be recorded .
observe the rate and type of breathing now and then .
pack some supplies in the handbag or hand luggage , in case one gets separated from suitcase .
there is no doubt that diabetes seems beridden bv :
limitations in life activities .
1 . who are the persons prone to become diabetic ?
those who have a family history of diabetes mellitus and who tend to be overweight .
3 . does infection cause diabetes ?
no . by mere contact or living with a person suffering from diabetes , one cannot get this disease .
7 . can there be diabetes without symptoms ?
yes . mild case may have no symptoms whatsoever . the dis -

9 . what is the role of caloric component of diet in diabetic control ? '
18 . can insulin be taken by mouth ?
it being a protein is destroyed in the gut before getting absorbed .
( b ) by having a blood sugar test done at regular intervals .
psychogenic impotence is by far the commonest type . psychologic impotence is not difficult to recognise : it is typified by selectivity and periodicity .

crowns strengthen and protect the remaining tooth structure and can improve the appearance of your smile .
types of crowns include the full porcelain crown , the porcelain - fused - to - metal crown and the all - metal crown .
fitting a crown requires at least two visits to the dentist ' s office .
it may interfere with speech and breathing because this mouthguard requires that the jaw be closed to hold it in place .
a stock mouthguard is not considered acceptable as a facial protective device .
the shell is lined with acrylic or rubber .
when placed in an athletes mouth , the protectors lining material molds to the teeth and is allowed to set .
the " boil - and - bite " mouthguard is used by more than 90 percent of athletes who use mouthguards .
it offers the best protection , fit and comfort level because it is made from a cast to fit your teeth .
how should i care for a mouthguard ?
but there does not seem to be any basis for such a belief .
in different parts of the country , different seasons are preferred for getting animals castrated .
two cuts should be given on each side of the cord .
the burdizzo should not be placed too low on the cord as it may crush the testicles .
rinderpest is a highly contagious and fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes .
the carcass and the infected litter should be carefully disposed . of .
tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease , affecting various species of animals including cows and buffaloes .
it is also comuunicable to human beings either through infected milk or meat .
the chief symptoms of the disease are loss of condition , short , dry , husky cough and gradual emaciation .
some dairymen increase the carbohydrates for fresh cows by adding sugar or molasses to the ration .
water drunk in large quantities immediately after feeding on leguminous or succulent pastures hastens such an attack .
death may occur in very severe cases .
sheep are perhaps the meekest of domestic animals .
broadly speaking , there are three main types of sheep found in india .
these types correspond to the three geophysiographic divisions of the country , the temperate himalayan region , the dry western region , and the southern region .
the temperate himalayan region comprises kashmir , himachal pradesh , and the hilly districts of punjab and uttar pradesh .
the sheep in this region have superior fleece with higher percentage of undercoat .
the important breeds of this region are gurez , karanah , bhakarwal , gaddi and rampur - bushiar .
its wool is long - stapled and lustrous white and less hairy .
the average yield is about 1.5 kilograms per shearing .
karanah sheep are . chiefly bred near kel in kashmir state .
gaddi ( bhadarwah ) is an important breed of kister and bhadarwah tehsils in the jammu region of kashmir state .
they are also reared in the kulu and kangra valleys , and in the charnba and mandi areas of himachal pradesh .
the fleece of these sheep is generally white .
dry western region includes rajasthan , south - east punjab , gujarat and parts of western uttar pradesh .
the wool from this region is considered suitable for carpet manufacture and is exported in large quantities .
selection of ram is most important in improving a flock .
the ram should be masculine in appearance , strong and healthy .
it should have strong legs and sound feet .
the chest should be broad and deep .
the sheep should be sheared in a clean , dry place , free from dust .
different qualities of wool should not be mixed .
the mixing of the hair from the legs , belly and the thighs lowers the quality of fleece .
the right type of shears with well - sharpened blades should be used to obtain a quick and uniform cut . i
the wool fibres are valued according to their elasticity and uniformity .
as a rule , the finer the wool , the shorter its length .
the major portion of the wool obtained in india is hairy and coarse .
the wool is generally coloured and is not suitable for making superior cloth .
india is , however , considered the world ' s best producer of high - quality carpet wool .
at about 24 to 26 months , second pair of permanent teeth appear .
thereafter the approximate age can be determined from the degree of wearing and discolouration of the teeth .
common diseases of sheep
most of the infectious diseases in sheep are caused as a result of poor management practices .
over - stocking , grazing on low wet lands , sudden change in environments and feed are some of the main causes of sickness in sheep .
they also frequently suffer from parasites , both external and internal .
internal parasites can be controlled through proper pasture management and by keeping the sheep under hygienic conditions .
signs of illness in sheep are not as easily discernible as in other domestic animals .
sheep keep on following their usual routine even when they are seriously sick .
one can only make out a sick sheep by observing its movements very carefully .
the normal temperature of healthy sheep is 39.4 degrees c ( 103 degrees f ) .
the pulse rate varies from 68 to 90 and the respiration rate from 20 to 30 per minute .
the disease causes rapid deaths in quick succession in the flock .
the main symptoms are difficult breathing , with a rasping noise , high temperature , severe diarrhoea and swelling at the throat .
to prevent the disease , general prophylactic measures should be adopted .
the animal dies soon after infection , generally within six hours .
high temperature and lameness are the chief symptoms of this disease .
the goat is known as the poor man ' s cow all over the world .
in switzerland , the milch goat is said to be the swiss baby ' s foster - mother .
goat ' s milk is highly wholesome and nourishing .
it is considered specially suitable for invalids and infants on account of is easy digestibility .
india is estimated to have produced about 2 million tonnes of goat milk during 1991 out of a worldwide production of just over 10 million tonnes .
goat flesh also fetches a better price than lamb and beef in most of the urban markets .
the intestines of goats are used to make catguts .
goat hair is used for rope - making .
the goat has a habit of nibbling the buds of trees and of foraging on nearly any variety of plants .
for this reason , it is considered a great enemy of vegetation , bringing about the erosion of soil .
this - destructive habit is , however , mainly due to wrong management practices .
adoption of correct practices for their care can bring about desirable change in their feeding habits .
they do not usually thrive in a damp climate or in the plains .
they can withstand very severe cold weather .
generally , their colour is white or black and white .
they have long curved horns and long ears .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .

periodontal disease
periodontal disease , or gum disease , is a leading cause of tooth loss in adults .
regular dental visits are essential to maintaining gum health and timely diagnosis and treatment when needed .
the early stage of gum disease is called gingivitis .
there are many forms and stages of periodontal disease . most common are :
periodontitis a more advanced stage of gum disease involving bone and ligament surrounding the teeth . if left untreated , it can damage the bone and supporting tissues .
the disease rapidly spreads among goats .
among domestic animals pigs are the most prolific breeders and quick growers .
a unit of ten sows and one boar will produce over 160 piglets during the first year .
pigs can make a full and efficient use of the cereal byproducts .
pigs require much less feed for each kilogram of gain in body - weight .
pig meat has a great demand in the manufacture of products such as ham , bacon and sausages .
pig - rearing can give quick returns with a low investment .
it is a prolific type of pig , and gives very large litters .
large white yorkshire breed is white in colour .
it is extremely long and deep and is firm fleshed .
generally , there are two seasons for breeding pigs , august - september and february - march .
liberal feeding during these periods helps in bringing the sows to heat early .
the young gilt shows the signs of first heat when she is about four to six months of age .
sows , after farrowing , come into heat between five to seven days after the litter is weaned .
the sow should be served at this time .
the usual indications of heat in a sow are loss of appetite , restlessness , heavy or enlarged vulva , and a light mucous discharge .
the sow frequently mounts on other sows and occasionally makes peculiar loud grunting sounds .
the gestation period in sows varies from 112 to 116 days , the average being 113 days .
it is characterised by high fever , loss of appetite , staggering gait , laboured respiration and sometimes swelling of the throat and diarrhoea or dysentery .
vaccination for longer and active immunity against this disease may be carried out during april - may as a preventive measure .
the defects in diet , housing and management should be removed .
anthrax is a highly contagious and fatal disease of pigs .
in the event of an outbreak , anti - anthrax serum should be used .
infectious dysentery is a common disease of pigs .
the main symptoms of this disease are slight fever and general passivity followed by a dark coloured bloody diarrhoea .
contact between teeth
dental cleaning ( prophylaxis )
assessment of mouth cleanliness
regular preventive maintenance of this type , along with a thorough home care regimen , helps assure your good oral health .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .
inside the hard outer shell of each tooth is a specialized area called the pulp or nerve chamber .
it is important to discuss your symptoms with your dentist to determine the cause and proper treatment .
what causes sensitive teeth ?
in healthy teeth , porous tissue called dentin is protected by your gums and your teeth ' s hard enamel shell .
dentin can be exposed by :
receding gums caused by improper brushing or gum disease .
treatment
a soft - bristle toothbrush .
a special toothpaste for sensitive teeth that can either block access to the nerve or make the nerve itself less sensitive .
it consists of many closely - packed rods made of minerals .
when you eat , acid forms on the outside of the tooth and seeps into the enamel ' s rods .
this demineralization process can produce a weak spot in the tooth ' s surface .
these microscopic views of the tooth ' s chewing surface show how fluoride works :
enamel rods demineralized , or broken down , by acid
enamel rods remineralized or rebuilt , by fluoride and the minerals in saliva .
common sources of fluoride are fluoridated drinking water , toothpaste and mouth rinse .
inform your dentist if your drinking water is not fluoridated .
angular , bony impaction of third molar ( wisdom tooth ) .
soft tissue impaction of third molar ( wisdom tooth ) .
incision is made and overlying bone is removed , exposing crown of impacted tooth .
tooth is extracted whole or surgically sectioned . the site is sutured closed .
use ice packs on the cheek for swelling , alternating on and off every thirty minutes .
apply biting pressure with clean gauze to stop bleeding .
eat soft foods and drink extra liquids .
but for better growth and production , they need grain feed .
the feed should be fed as wet mash and should consist of greens , cereals , bran and limestone grit .
normally , one male is run with four to six females .
turkeys are hardy birds but they are subject to many of the diseases to which domestic fowls are susceptible .
black - head is a serious disease of the turkeys .
as in chickens , great care is needed to keep the premises in sanitary and hygienic conditions .
the normal temperature in turkeys is 42 degrees c ( 107.6 degrees f ) .
guinea fowls can play an important part in the poultry business .
they are raised primarily for meat .
they , however , prefer to remain in a semi - wild environment .
they roam about widely in search of food .
this rule covers , for instance , the appearance and finish of the goods , their safety , and their durability .
these are your statutory rights .
many traders have goodwill policies that go beyond your statutory rights .
you have fewer rights if you buy privately ( that is , not from a trader ) or at an auction .
see page 56
if in doubt seek further advice .
see pages 27 - 29 .
you have no real grounds for complaint if you :
were told the fault ;
examined the item when you bought it and should have seen the fault ;
with reasonable care and skill - a job should be done to a proper standard of workmanship .
if you get a new extension to your house , the walls should not crack and the roof must not leak ;
always ask a trader how much a particular job will cost .
the trader may only be able to make an informed guess at the cost and give you an estimate .
if you agree a fixed cost it is usually called a quotation .
take or send the completed form to your local county court or sheriff court .
there is a court fee , but this is payable by your opponent if you win your case .
the court will ' serve ' the summons on the defendant and tell you what to do next .
the necessary forms are available from the court office ( look under ' courts ' in the telephone book for the address ) together with an information booklet .
some bookshops sell advice packs which includes the forms .
leaflets are also available from any county or sheriff court .
misleading prices
it is a criminal offence for traders to make misleading price claims about goods or services .
when you need or want to have a service done , find out in advance what it will cost by getting an estimate or quotation .
an estimate is generally a rough price while a quotation is normally a fixed price .
make sure you know which you are getting and ask for it to be put in writing .
check whether prices quoted include vat .
buying on credit
work out what the total cost of the loan will be ;
shop around for credit : how much will a loan cost to repay each month and for how long ?
make sure you can afford to pay back the loan and the interest - and still have enough to cover all your other commitments .
check whether the loan has a variable rate of interest .
if it has , your repayments can go up as well as down .
if you are refused credit you have certain rights .
do not sign anything until you are sure you know what commitment you are making .
( there are some exceptions to this : for example , perishable goods and home extensions ) .
if you have cancellation rights these must be given to you in writing .
a seller who enters into a contract with you without advising you in writing of these rights will have committed an offence .
if you have specifically asked a seller to visit you at home , you may not have the right to cancel
take care if you buy at an auction .
auctioneers , unlike other sellers , can refuse to accept responsibility for the quality of the goods they auction .
look out for exclusion clauses and read notices and catalogues carefully .
note any conditions of sale , such as buyers ' premium , terms and method of payment , deposits , and time limits for removal of goods .
privately bought goods do not have to be free of faults , but they must be as described .
for example , a leather coat should not be plastic , and full length curtains must not be half length .
some dealers offer fixed price ' no haggle ' deals , but in general , most car prices are negotiable .
it is up to you to negotiate the best deal .
a dealer earns commission by arranging finance , so you may be able to bargain for part of the commission on the finance deal .
consider whether you are getting the best deal .
if you are trading in your old car , make sure you know what it is worth .
it ' s a good idea to avoid stating the price you want for your trade - in .
let the dealer offer you a price and then try to move it upwards .
you must then decide whether you have a good deal .
modern markets : confident consumers
modern markets : confident consumers
a fair deal and prosperity go hand in hand .
and better performance in business in turn benefits consumers .
the competition authorities will then look at whether any discrepancies are caused by anti - competitive behaviour .
to make informed choices , consumers need reliable information on price , quality and the safety of products .
the government will take steps to ensure that consumers have access to accurate , comprehensive and comprehensible information .
better information on prices
goods on sale in shops will be clearly priced .
and it will be easier to compare the price of goods in different quantities .
the government proposes to change the law to introduce tougher controls on misdescriptions of services .
providing timely information
however , the government will legislate when new circumstances emerge for consumers that cannot be dealt with in other ways .
updating and simplifying the law on weights and measures
the current system of consumer credit licensing .
the government wants a much clearer targeting of the dishonest .
a power for the courts to grant injunctions against specific practices carried out by specified traders
what is a home - school agreement ?
a home - school agreement will explain the aims and values of your child ' s school .
it will spell out the responsibilities of the school and your responsibilities , and what the school expects of their pupils .
why are home - school agreements important ?
children achieve more when schools and parents work together .
home - school agreements will help you to work with your child ' s school .
your support and encouragement are very important if your child is to make the most of school .
will all schools have these agreements ?
all state schools will have a written home - school agreement .
when will they be introduced ?
schools will introduce these agreements from september 1999 .
but , before then , your child ' s school will ask for your views on what their home - school agreement should say .
each school will have its own home - school agreement .
you and your child ' s school should decide together what your agreement should say .
this might say something about the standard of attainment the school is aiming for .
schools must draw up targets for national curriculum assessments , gcses and vocational qualifications .
schools have to identify and support children with special educational needs .
they can set extra targets to measure the progress of these children .
the agreement might draw attention to these .
the agreement might refer to the school ' s particular character and spirit ( ethos ) .
regular attendance on time
it is important for your child ' s future that he or she makes the most of his or her time at school .
this means going regularly and turning up on time , qualities valued by employers .
home - school agreements should remind you of this .
if you are a parent or carer , did you know the following ?
by law you are responsible for making sure that your children are educated between the ages of 5 and 16 .
if they do not go to school regularly , you may be fined .
it is your responsibility to tell the school if your child cannot go .
you do not have a right to take children on holiday in term - time .
discipline and behaviour
although they know the green cross code they do n ' t always apply it .
what can you do ?
you can do a lot to protect your child .
this leaflet tells you the best way to teach the skills your child needs .
only you can decide when your child is ready to move from one stage to the next .
children under five cannot cope with traffic .
never let them out alone or even with an older child .
choose somewhere safe for them to play ; never on the pavement or in the road , however quiet .
set a good example .
explain what traffic is .
every child should learn about traffic before going to school .
whenever you take your child out walking , tell them what you are doing and why .
practise on quiet roads near home .
then let your child lead you across .
finally , let him or her cross while you wait behind , watching carefully .
at this age , children are not ready to cross alone .
the risk of a road accident rises when children start school .
take the safest route to school , crossing roads at the safest place and explaining why .
watch and test before letting your child cross quiet roads alone .
later , start to practise crossing busier roads together .
many children cannot judge how fast vehicles are going or how far away they are .
the age when they can use and understand the green cross code is different for each child .
children learn by example , so when walking with children always use the green cross code .
being seen
make sure your child can be easily seen .
reflective material does work well and shows up in car headlights .
explain to your child why they should always wear something bright , especially at night .
there has been no ideal epidemiological study applying standard criteria so far in our country .
identification of the factors that promote vascular disease in the same population also needs to be defined more precisely .
such killer diseases should be recognised before their magnitude assumes enormous and alarming proportions .
public awareness on such health issues is very important so as not to follow lifestyles that would in the long term shorten the life span .
this proves to be of great value in the follow - up of a diabetic .
6 arrive alive
keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross
the lea may also ask what your child thinks about their sen .
what your child thinks can play an important part in the lea ' s assessment .
what happens after the assessment ?
the tribunal is based in london but , outside the south east , appeals are heard locally .
the tribunal is made up of three people .
one of these will be the chairman , who will be a lawyer .
you can also ask up to two people who know your child to speak for you at the tribunal .
the tribunal will look at the evidence and will make a final decision .
in reaching this decision , the tribunal may consider how the lea ' s actions compare to the guidance set out in the sen code of practice .
just because an lea has not followed the code will not always mean that their decision was wrong .
how long do you have to appeal ?
it is important that the appeal procedure does not delay any special educational help your child needs .
for this reason , you have to apply to the tribunal no later than two months after the lea tell you their decision .
it is only possible to get the time limit extended in a very few cases .
you can find out more about the tribunal in a special booklet .
he will ask the lea first if it has any objections to providing the documents .
where will my hearing be held ?
tribunal hearings will usually be held within normal working hours .
your hearing will be fixed for a specific time and will normally be booked to last half a day .
many a time the infection is present but the individual remains unaware due to lack of usual symptoms like fever , pain , or local organ dysfunction .
chronic complications end organ involvement diabetes can affect all organs of the body .
vascular disorders in a diabetic are seemingly related to type of diabetes and its duration .
more important though is how well diabetes has been controlled .
circulatory system heart and blood vessels work closely together and make up the cardiovascular system .
you can bring a solicitor or barrister to represent you but you will not get legal aid .
do i have to answer questions at the hearing myself ?
for example , they may want to ask you about your child ' s needs at home .
you do not have to answer these questions if you do not want to .
can my child go to the hearing ?
your child can go to the hearing and give evidence .
however , you should remember that it is unlikely that your child will stay for the whole hearing .
can i bring anyone else to support my case ?
you may bring up to two witnesses to the hearing .
you must provide their details on the attendance form .
if it is not possible to write to us before the hearing , you can ask the tribunal panel at the start of the hearing .
the panel will only rarely allow extra witnesses .
you may also bring two other people with you for support but they will not be able to take part in the hearing .
if the president agrees , he will send you a witness summons for you to give to the person .
the chairman will explain the procedure to you before the hearing begins .
the members of the tribunal will want to find out the following from you and the lea .
what you think are the relevant facts .
what conclusions you think the tribunal should come to .
what you think should now be done for your child .
the chairman will try to make the procedure as straightforward as possible so everyone can give their point of view .
the tribunal members will ask questions without using legal or educational jargon .
if their questions are not clear , you can ask them to explain what they mean before you answer .
this will give everyone the chance to look at the points as they come up , without getting muddled .
if you need other breaks , you should ask the chairman .
there may be rare cases when the hearing lasts longer than this .
very occasionally , the tribunal members may need more evidence .
if this is the case , the chairman will explain what the tribunal needs and will ask you to come back another day .
this will give you and the lea time to produce this .
what expenses can i claim ?
if you bring along a relative or friend to look after your child , you will be able to claim travel expenses for them as well .
we cannot pay other costs , such as car parking or tolls .
what expenses can my witnesses claim ?
your two main witnesses will also be able to claim travel expenses and should use public transport wherever possible .
we will only pay for standard - class rail travel or a fixed amount for mileage if your witnesses have to travel by car .
we will also pay a fixed amount for loss of earnings .
the amounts are similar to those paid for jury service .
your representative , if you have one , will not be able to claim expenses from us .
how do i claim my expenses ?
we will send you details about claiming expenses when we write to tell you about the arrangements for the hearing .
how will the tribunal come to a decision ?
the lea should attach these to the final statement .
direction an order by the president which you or the lea must reply to .
letters or reports , including a statement of special educational needs .
through the mammography we can also diagnose other problems of breast which are not carcinogenic .
generally breast cancer can be treated .
if it is diagnosed early it can be treated easily and successfully .
what happens at a breast screening centre ?
it will be convenient if you wear a skirt , trousers or a sari .
how is a mammogram taken ?
a radiographer who is generally female will help you to hold your breast in the right position to take the mammogram .
each breast is held between two special plates .
in a few moments an x - ray can be taken .
for some women the pressure of the plates may be painful or inconvenient .
the mammogram takes a few seconds , and the time to visit the centre is barely half an hour .
who needs a mammography ?
if you are above 64 years old , then a mammogram will be taken on your request .
ask your doctor .
is mammography safe ?
the intensity of the radiation is generally very low and the pressure of the plate is not harmful or adverse .
the pain during diagnosis or testing for breast cancer is really negligible in comparison to its benefits .
how will i find out the result ?
most women who are called again are not cancer patients .
be aware that knowing earlier about cancer leads to a more successful treatment .
details about breast
by mammography we can detect cancer in 19 out of 20 women .
but there is a very , very slight chance that we may not detect breast cancer by mammogram .
it is most important to observe your breasts carefully , because you would be the first person to know about any change or any abnormality in your breasts .
although you have gone through mammography , whenever you find any cyst or change in your breasts , contact your doctor
many diabetics have high blood pressure .
uncontrolled , both diabetes and high blood pressure are important risk factors for heart attack .
small vessel diseases diabetes also causes changesin the walls of small blood vessels , especially those in the eyes and kidneys .
as the disease progresses , the basement membranes of the vessels become thicker , weaker and inefficient ; thus the vessels begin to ' leak ' .
these changes are closely related to the severity of the diabetes and its duration .
kidney disease kidney disease and kidney failure can result from a number of causes , some of which are linked to diabetes .
there is leakage of albumin in the urine .
be aware that knowing earlier about cancer leads to a more successful treatment .
free test
some important facts to keep in mind
you need to register with your gp .
make sure your correct address is in your doctor ' s records .
these are common tests for many : cervical smear and mammogram .
take their results seriously .
why is it necessary to discuss organ donation with my relatives so soon after my death ?
your questions on organ donation answered .
if you find that your child has been using drugs what can you do ?
this is a question with as many different answers as there are families .
you must make your own decisions but this booklet will help you .
one needs to understand that diets for the diabetics are nutritious and balanced .
this makes it easier to incorporate these constituents in routine meals .
more input by personal discussion with the dietician can help improve the diet regimen and meal planning for a diabetic .
one ' s eating habits are based on satiety , available resources for purchase of food items and a social component .
the objectives of diet therapy are :
like sucrose , it does have calories , but it is slightly sweeter so one should use less of it .
it may be allowed in diet in small amounts .
a few artificial sweetners without caloric value are also available .
one example is aspartum .
between 15 and 20 per cent of daily calories should come from proteins .
fats and proteins are often chosen together in planning a diet .
today , though , when food is processed for the market , most of the natural fibres are removed .
the fibre itself has no nutritional value , but it provides bulk in the diet .
the major one is to help speed the digestion of food and the elimination of wastes .
a high - fibre diet may also increase the number of insulin receptor sites .
diets with large amounts of fibre are often helpful in control of diabetes .
most prescribed diets contain an ' eat ' list and a ' do n ' t eat ' list plus a few sample menus .
it is sometimes difficult with this information to practically make tasty meals all 365 days of a year .
present consensus on nutritional requirements for individuals with diabetes mellitus is as follows :
carbohydrates 55 to 65 % of total energy ; sucrose 20gm / day .
each group contains a long list of foods , together with a recommended portion , called an exchange .
therefore , each item on a list is roughly equal to all the others .
the exchange system is not just for people who need to lose weight .
even people with diabetes of normal weight may want help planning varied meals .
diets based on the exchange system can be planned for any number of calories a day .
meals are planned using each group .
all six groups work together to provide a balanced diet .
80 calories portions l .
on outer and inner surfaces , brush at a 45 - degree angle in short , half - tooth - wide strokes against the gumline .
brush the tongue in a back - to - front sweeping motion to remove food particles and freshen your mouth .
flossing daily removes plaque and food particles between teeth and below the gumline .
floss around the abutment teeth of a bridge and under artificial teeth using a floss threader .
you may experience sore or bleeding gums for the first several days you floss .
be sure to follow the special home care instructions provided by your dental professional .
pre - mixed insulins are 30 per cent short and 70 per cent intermediate - acting .
insulin should be stored in a cool place or in a refrigerator ( butter - shelf ) .
biosynthetically prepared human insulins are now available , though expensive .
insulin in a diabetic is required in the following states :
childhood diabetics ( less than 15 years of age ) .
diabetics who are considerably underweight .
methods to compensate for any likely increased physical activity .
modification of dose during intercurrent disease .
caloric content of foods ( sources of hidden calories such as cream , sweets or alcohol ) .
such a decision must be left to the treating physician .
this type of exercise helps make the entire cardiovascular system work proficiently .
considerations one should check with a physician before beginning an exercise programme .
because benefits of exercise on glucose are transient , exercise has to be done on a regular and long - term basis .
benefits of exercise are lost when no exercise is performed for a period of three days .
exercise can result in an increase in appetite and , therefore , calorie intake .
disadvantages of being overweight excessive weight puts on added burden on heart , lungs , digestive , muscular and articular systems .
diseases as coronary artery disease , hypertension , obstructive airway disease , gall stones , arthritis , etc . are more frequent amongst the obese .
overall , an overweight person is a poor risk and his / her life expectancy is reduced compared to persons of normal weight .
a sound recommendation is to follow a reducing diet ( balanced ) of 800 to 1,000 calories per day distributed during mealtimes in the day .
31 . are diabetics particularly prone to infection ?
32 . can a diabetic have a full active life without restrictions upon physical activity ?
34 . are these late complications of diabetes preventable ?
yes , most of these complications are preventable or can be greatly minimised by constant care and cooperation between the diabetic patient and his physician .
the animal seeks seclusion and shows signs of restlessness by frequently waving the tail and by sitting and standing at short intervals .
as far as possible , nature should be allowed to have its own course .
a warm bran mash just before and after calving should be given to the animal .
as soon as the calf is born , the mother should be encouraged to lick the calf .
if , for any reason , she fails to do so , the mucous from the mouth and the nostrils of the calf should be removed and cleaned .
the navel cord of the calf should be tied about 2.5 centimetres away from the body and cut about one centimetre below the ligature .
normally , the cow or buffalo throws the after - birth within five to six hours .
if necessary , the calf should be helped to suckle the teats .
for efficient production , the animal needs sufficient , well - balanced feed .
the feed must be satisfying , both qualitatively and quantitatively .
cattle like other ruminants have four stomachs .
the first three are the enlargement of the food pipe .
they enable an animal to take large quantities of food at a time , to be processed and chewed at leisure .
the first stomach acts as a store for food which has been cut into small pieces and mixed with saliva .
the second stomach acts as a store for water .
when the animal has finished eating , the solid portion of food is sent back to the mouth by the contraction of the first and the second stomachs .
after it is chewed again and converted into a finer mass , it goes direct to the third stomach .
in the third stomach , by the help of its folds , the food is squeezed and ground .
it then passes to the fourth stomach where it is acted upon by digestive juices .
in feeding cattle , care should be taken that they are provided well - balanced ration throughout the year .
cattle always love to have a variety in their food .
mixing of different types of fodders gives better results .
the feeding stuffs which are laxative in nature should be preferred .
while introducing change in ration , it should be done gradually to enable the animal to adjust itself to the change .
the grain ration should be coarsely ground and soaked for some time before feeding .
as far as possible , the milch animals should be provided with green and succulent fodder all the year round .
this is the time when she is preparing herself for the coming lactation .
the bullocks at medium and heavy work would require daily one and three kilograms of additional grain ration , respectively .
the actual composition of the grain mixture would largely depend upon the availability of the feeds and their cost .
ordinarily , a good concentrate mixture should contain one part of crushed grain , two parts of bran or husk and one part of oil - cake .
in the case of a new - born calf , mother ' s first milk called colostrum , should be given for four or five days .
later on , this can be replaced gradually by skimmed milk , until the age of 24 weeks , when skimmed milk may be discontinued .
when the calf is two to three weeks old , it begins to nibble at hay or soft grass .
the quantity of grain ration may be increased gradually to about one kilogram daily at the age of about six months .
for high - yielding milch animals and for growing youngstock of improved breeds , mineral supplement is also necessary .
in rice - growing areas , paddy straw forms the major portion of the roughage feed for cattle .
paddy straw has a low nutritional value .
it also regulates the body temperature .
animals can live much longer without solid food than without water .
it is , therefore , essential that sufficient water should be made available to the cattle at all times .
clean milk should also be free from organisms which may cause disease .
unclean milk becomes sour more quickly than clean milk .
once the milk ' becomes unclean , it cannot be made clean again .
therefore , scrupulous care should be taken to keep the milk free from any contamination .
the milking shed should always be kept clean .
for weaning calves successfully , the cow should not be allowed to see the calf at birth .
the teats nearest the forelimbs give more milk than those nearest the hind limbs .
exercise
for the proper health and growth of pigs , plenty of exercise is necessary .
in the case of fattening stock , however , exercise should be restricted to the minimum necessary to keep the animals healthy .
normally pigs require two to three litres of water per kilogram of concentrates .
a liberal supply of drinking water is especially important in the case of nursing sows .
mineral deficiency
breeding stock need special attention .
animals which are in poor condition should be provided additional feed about a week before the starting of the breeding season .
a mixture of six parts of maize , three parts ground barley or wheat and one part fish or meat meal has been found suitable for breeding stock .
whenever possible , green vegtables such as turnips , cabbage , beans and potatoes should be provided .
waste from slaughter houses should always be thoroughly cooked before feeding .
roots are best given uncooked , but potatoes should never be given raw .
the use of soyabean should , however , be restricted as it tends to produce soft pork .
soup prepared from the bones from the bacon factories , mixed with the grain mixture , is also considered suitable for feeding the fattening stock .
if the market demands pork with plenty of fat , the stock should i be ) fed on maize .
feeding of fish meal for slaughter stock should be very cautiously done to eliminate the risk of any fish taint in the flesh .
fish meal should be eliminated altogether from the ration for about a fortnight prior to slaughter .
in addition to green feed , the fattening stock should be given approximately a kilogram of concentrate mixture up to 23 kilograms of body - weight .
pigs should not be kept in overcrowded and damp houses .
each pen should preferably have an open yard with some natural shade , where the animals can move about freely .
to keep the pens warm during winter , they should be bedded with dry straw .
during hot weather , small wallows containing water , about 20 to 25 centimetres deep , should be provided in the paddocks to keep the pigs cool .
the number and size of pens will , of course , depend upon the number of pigs to be accommodated .
leading from the open yards , there should preferably be a common spacious grazing ground on either side with a few shady trees .
prevention of diseases
pigs should always be suspected of being ill when they lie down a lot and are disinclined to move when provoked .
the walls should be white - washed with lime containing d . d . t .
when white - washing , especially kutcha structures , all the crevices should be thoroughly filled up .
the carcass of the infected animal should be buried deep with a layer of lime or disposed of by burning .
healthy animals , which have been in contact with infected ones , should be got protected with proper vaccination or serum .
common diseases of pigs
swine fever is a highly contagious disease .
it is accompanied by high fever and appearance of red or purplish blotches on the skin of the ears , belly and inner side of legs .
the other symptoms are loss of appetite , laboured breathing , cough , weakness , vomitting and diarrhoea .
foot and mouth is a contagious disease .
the premises should be thoroughly disinfected and cleaned .
antiseptic lotions should be applied to the feet and used as mouth - wash .
in severe cases , lesions may occur on all parts of the skin .
the stable , manger and watering utensils should be thoroughly disinfected .
the recovered animals should not be returned to work immediately .
glanders - farcy is a highly infectious and fatal disease .
superficial lymph vessels are swollen , and small elevations arise along their course .
to prevent the spread of this disease , all affected animals should be destroyed .
healthy animals should not be allowed to use water and feeding troughs used by affected animals .
preventive measures include feeding animals oftener and in smaller quantities .
food should be given at regular hours .
inferior or damaged food and sudden change in diet should be avoided .
horse should not be given full feed just before putting it to fast work and cold water soon after hard work .
horses are most susceptible , mules less and donkeys the least .
incidence of the disease is very high during the warmer rainy months .
in winter , the disease generally subsides totally .
respiratory tract , or heart , or both may be involved .
it can maintain itself on thorny shrubs in a desert , where other herbivores will die of hunger .
camel is a ruminant like cattle , sheep and goats .
owing to the greater thickness of the skin , the water loss through evaporation is reduced to a minimum .
the fine hair on the body of the camel act as insulation and help to ward off the excessive atmospheric heat .
the lips of the camel are covered with tough skin , which enables it to eat hard and thorny plants .
due to its long neck , the camel can have easy access to the branches of the high trees .
its flesh is eaten in many countries .
its milk is considered rich and nourishing drink and is used for human consumption .
according to the livestock census 1982 , there are 1.08 million camels in india .
these were 0.94 per cent more than the number in 1977 .
there are two species of camels .
the bactrian camel is an inhabitant of central asia and has two humps .
the second is arabian or dromedary camel which has one hump .
in india , only the one - humped species of arabian camel is met with .
the arabian camel , as a rule , is less heavily built and longer in the hind than the bactrian .
its coat is soft and comparatively thin .
a cow - camel is sexually mature at four years of age .
it continues to breed up to the age of 20 years .
this gives her necessary rest to withstand the strain under rugged desert conditions .
the gestation period in a cow - camel is comparatively longer than in any other domestic ruminant .
it varies from 375 to 392 days , average being 389 days .
cow - camel gives birth to one calf at a time .
the oestrum lasts for three to four days .
the first three weeks of life in a new - born camel is the most critical period .
great care should be taken that the calf does not take milk in excessive quantity .
the camel calf begins to graze very early in life , generally when it is four to six weeks old .
the cow - camel is milked twice a day .
it usually continues to give milk from ten to eighteen months , average being fifteen months .
besides the milk required for the calf , . she may give about nine litres of milk daily .
when properly fed and looked after , a camel may prove to be a potent source of milk in desert regions .
the camel ' s milk has a pleasant taste .
butter can be made out of camel ' s milk only with difficulty .
feeding of camels the camel is a herbivorous animal and lives by browsing on trees , shrubs and bushes .
the size of the hump of a camel is a good indication of its nourishment .
the hump increases in size when ample feed is available .
when sufficient grazing is not available , it should be supplemented by stall - feeding .
the pads of the feet should be hard , nails smooth and polished and paces fast and easy .
the tail should be long with a good tuft and bristles .
cases of wild elephant - bulls covering tamed female elephants in forests are not infrequent .
the age of reproductive maturity in elephants varies from 8 to 15 years .
abortions , caused from undue exertion , have been very rarely reported .
normally , the act of parturition occupies short time .
at the time of parturition , the female shows signs of restlessness and great agony .
she groans and twists the body .
the head is often tossed , with the trunk playing in the air .
an hour or so before actual delivery , a discharge may be noticed from the genital passage .
in comparison with the average cow milk , it contains about eight per cent more solids and over four per cent more fat .
elephants ' life is said to be one continuous meal .
as long as any food is before them , they will go on eating even when their appetite is fully satisfied .
in the wild state , elephants have the habit of munching food a good part of the twenty - four hours .
in the elephant , all food is conveyed to the mouth by the trunk .
the stomach in elephants is a simple sack unlike that of most herbivora and measures nearly one metre .
the total length of the intestinal tract is about 30 metres .
the food ' passes through the intestinal tract of the elephant fairly rapidly .
this is largely due to the fact that the elephant is not a ruminant .
the length of time that the food remains in the intestinal tract is about twenty - four hours .
the total daily weight of the fresh faeces in elephants is about 110 kilograms .
five or six boluses are passed at one time .
these may weigh as much as two kilograms each .
the faeces give an impression of a mass of chopped hay .
the digestibility of hay is extremely poor as compared with that of other domestic animals .
a single discharge of urine in elephants amounts , on an average , to five litres .
the total volume of urine passed in a day is about fifty litres .
the elephant is essentially an animal of the forest .
its food largely consists of tree leaves , young and tender bamboo shoots and green grass .
wherever conditions permit , elephants should be allowed extensive grazing and choice of their own fodder .
in feeding elephants , it must be ensured that the elephants have plenty to eat and that the fodder is fresh , sweet and to their taste .
elephants are fastidious beasts and will not eat all that is placed before them .
the daily quantity of green fodder required by an elephant depends upon the quantity of dry fodder given .
the exact quantity of fodder required is best indicated by the animal ' s ability to dispose it of during twenty - four hours .
elephant driving is an art .
a good rider should not ordinarily shout at the animal .
a good rider controls the animal entirely by word of command and the proper application of the knees and feet when necessary .
elephants do not like exposure to direct sun .
it is dangerous to expose them to the direct sun as they are liable to get sun - stroke .
elephants , when working in the sun , should be provided with some cover for the head and neck .
exposure to rain , provided the drainage be good , does not seem to do much harm .
exposure to cold winds , however , affects their health adversely .
rest and sleep is very essential for the health of the animal .
regular bathing is most important to keep elephants healthy .
no animal delights more thoroughly than the elephant in a bath .
in the wild state , the animals pay daily visits to deep , cool pools in hilly streams and even large rivers .
for bathing elephants , the water should be deep enough at least to permit immersion of the whole body in the crouching position .
elephants should , on no account , be kept in places where facilities for bathing are not available .
they should preferably be taken into the water for bath shortly after daybreak and at sunset .
sickness in elephants
elephants generally do not fall sick , provided they receive proper care and attention .
in addition , the birds should be provided sufficient greens .
baby chicks do not need food of any kind for about 36 hours after hatching .
during this period , the contents of egg drawn by the chicks furnish the necessary food .
more recently , artificial hatching by incubators has become popular in india .
artificial hatching is economical where large number of eggs are required to be hatched .
the room should be well - ventilated .
the windows in the room should not be exposed to the direct rays of the sun .
normally , a temperature ranging from 38.3 to 39.4 degrees c ( 101 to 103 degrees f ) is maintained in small incubators .
in dry weather , humidity can be raised by placing the incubator above special trays filled with water or wet sand .
the colour of the egg - shell has no relationship with egg quality .
the colour of the shell is determined by the breed .
normally , the leghorn hens lay white eggs , while the colour of the rhode island red eggs is brown .
poor feeding may also result in eggs with poor shell quality .
proteins form nearly one - sixth of the whole egg .
the distribution of proteins and other major nutrients varies in yolk and white portions .
anti - peck devices have also been developed .
feather picking is another common vice among poultry birds .
the main causes responsible for this vice are faulty diet , close confinement , or mites which cause irritation .
in a flock , certain cocks develop the habit of showing special affinity towards certain hens and mate with them only .
this results in the production of infertile eggs ' by other hens .
this fault can be prevented by changing the cocks at short intervals .
disease prevention in fowls is a far more important measure than disease cure .
equipment , feeding and watering utensils should be thoroughly cleaned every day .
the general symptoms in a sick bird are loss of appetite , dullness , debility , rise in temperature , and comb and wattles become pale .
the bird , stands aloof , generally in a crouching position and shows signs of inactivity .
worms retard the growth of birds and reduce their egg laying capacity .
external parasites such as lice , ticks , mites and fleas cause great annoyance to poultry birds and affect their productive efficiency .
the general symptoms are wart - like nodules on the comb and wattles and appearance of greyish spots or blisters on the skin .
sometimes the eyes and nose are covered by a yellowish cheesy discharge .
in acute cases , the bird dies in convulsions .
ducks thrive well on any soil , preferably where semi - aquatic conditions prevail .
the colour of the drake is black at the neck and back .
the duck is of khaki colour which develops into grey when one year old .
the ducks start laying eggs at about six months ' age .
the maximum number of eggs are laid during the second year .
the birds are generally sold when four years old .
the eggs are of white colour .
the average weight of an egg is nearly 70 grams .
general management of ducks
the drake can be distinguished from the duck by the curly feather in his tail .
the drake has an inaudible thin voice .
the voice of the duck is very full .
the general management of ducks is similar to that as for the chickens .
young ducklings need not have running water until they are six to eight weeks old .
they are quite safe at five weeks to go into the grass run and range house .
the roof of the house may be of any kind , but the floor should be pucca , preferably cemented .
a house with a length of 3.6 metres , breadth 2.3 metres and height 1.8 metres will be enough to accommodate 24 ducks .
the normal rate of heart beat is 120 to 160 per minute .
when white and brown backed geese are interbred , they do not inherit any mixed colouring , and the progeny shows only one type .
the brown - backed goose has a white belly and brown wings , back and head .
the breast is light brown and the throat is white .
the white goose is white all over the body .
broad breasted bronze is the heaviest of all varieties and is most popular in the united states of america .
the average egg production is 75 eggs in the first year .
the eggs weigh nearly 85 grams each .
the colour of the egg is white mottled with brown .
the body weight is 11 kilograms for the young torn and 7 kilograms for the turkey hen of this breed .
it has low fertility and hatchability .
the reproductive ability of the turkey is relatively low , particularly with heavier breeds .
hatchability is also low in heavier varieties .
the female commences laying eggs about the middle of march .
turkey hens generally lay about 70 eggs during their first laying season .
when the turkey females reach eight to nine months of age , artificial lights are used to stimulate egg production in them .
artificial insemination is usually practised in turkey breeding .
during the breeding season , the average fertility with artificial insemination runs between 70 and 80 per cent .
turkey eggs take 28 days to hatch .
in the broad breasted bronze breed , eggs weighing over 80 grams are selected for hatching .
turkeys mature when three years old .
turkeys are usually bred for three or four years .
for maximum profit , turkeys should be marketed by the time they are 20 to 26 weeks of age .
fat grade in the turkey is judged by the thickness of the fold of the breast skin .
many changes have taken place since then .
however , the most significant took place in the the 17th century when western medicine ascribed thesweetness of urine in diabetes to sugar .
it was in 1921 that banting and best extracted a substance from the pancreas that could lower blood sugar in animals .
others find them a nuisance and would prefer not to receive them .
it may take up to three months for the unwanted mail to stop arriving .
see page 94 for the address .
telephone sales
many companies now use the telephone to promote their goods and services .
see page 94 .
if you are registered with the telephone preference service it is an offence for a company to continue to make unsolicited calls to you .
if the calls keep coming you can take up the matter with the office of telecommunications ( oftel ) .
if , however , you do decide you want to buy one , check the wording carefully .
make sure you know exactly what it does and does not cover before you sign .
do not choose a firm just because it guarantees its services .
insurance - backed guarantee schemes , however , are available through some trade associations to cover building work .
for long - term schemes make sure that the insurance covers the same period as the guarantee .
if an exclusion clause is unfair , it is legally void and cannot be used against you .
generally , only a court can decide if a contract term is unfair .
see pages 38 - 43 .
there is a code of practice covering doorstep and party plan selling .
the address is on page 91 .
if you want to cancel , act quickly .
send letters by recorded / special delivery so you have confirmation of the delivery .
it may be a good idea to send your letter by fax , but make sure you follow it up by sending the original copy by post .
auctions
if not , walk away .
if the car has already been inspected , ask to see the report .
if there is a warranty , what does it include ( and exclude ) , and will you have to pay extra for it ?
buying a used car privately
if you buy privately , you should expect to pay less as the seller does not have the expenses of a dealer .
does the seller really own the car ?
check the mot certificate if the car is more than three years old .
study the auctioneer ' s conditions of business .
you buy as seen and therefore have fewer rights of redress other than as set out in the conditions of sale .
you have little opportunity to check the past history and mechanical condition of the car .
be extra careful if you are buying from a temporary auction centre .
would you be able to contact the auctioneer after the sale ?
find a good garage .
does the garage look organised and efficient , and have helpful staff ?
this will ensure that the trader cannot say in court that you accepted the repair was satisfactory because you paid the bill .
see page 23 for how to complain .
if you are buying furniture , shop around and compare goods and prices to get the best deal .
get information from leaflets , catalogues and labels .
check that upholstered furniture carries a label stating that it meets fire safety requirements .
if you are buying a bed , lie on it for a time to see that it is comfortable .
the conciliator , whose decisions are binding on the retailer , will try to settle the matter to everyone ' s satisfaction .
if you are not happy with the decision , you can take court action , using the conciliator ' s findings if you wish .
electrical manufacturers are constantly developing their products as technology advances .
but are you sure you are going to need all those extra features ?
look at publications like ' which ? ' ( the magazine of the consumers ' association ) and specialist magazines .
then shop around , comparing prices and after - sales service .
check whether there are any special installation requirements and the servicing and repair arrangements .
some manufacturers provide telephone help lines to help sort out problems .
find out if there is a guarantee , what it covers , what is excluded and how long it is for .
often you will be asked if you want to buy an extended warranty .
check the procedures for making a claim .
will the warranty pay for repairs up front or will you have to pay first , and then claim the money back afterwards ?
keep details of any guarantee or warranty with your original receipt and any service or repair documents ; they may be needed later .
it is a good idea to make a note of serial numbers for future reference .
dealing with faults and repairs
if it still does not work , complain .
advice on complaining about goods or services is given on pages 22 - 35 .
a forward - looking approach , identifying problems at an early stage
greater consistency in analysis and the development of solutions
more cohesion between policy - making and enforcement organisations .
the white paper is the start of the process , not the end .
it will provide a solid basis for the development of consumer policy in the future .
the government will promote a joined - up approach both within and outside government .

the law
by law , all children of compulsory school age ( between 5 and 16 ) must get a proper full - time education .
skin infections are more likely , and cuts may be slow to heal .
it is understandable , therefore , that many people may not think of them as something to see a doctor about .
moreover , about a third of all type ii diabetics have no symptoms at all .
usually they are just over 40 and overweight .
they frequently first find out about their disease from a routine physical check - up .
with or without symptoms , diabetes is very easy to diagnose .
a childminder start - up grant will help with your set - up costs .
playwork : out - of - school clubs and holiday play schemes
depending , of course , on your own interests .
for qualified staff at manager or supervisor level , nurseries are usually looking for :
nvq level 3 in early years care and education or
the main qualification for this is :
the certificate in pre - school practice ( a vocational qualification at level 2 ) .
you could then progress to a managerial or supervisory position on the job .
the main qualification for this is :
this is available via distance learning through the national extension college .
you may then choose to progress towards a supervisory role by gaining a level 3 qualification .

these factors do not seem to be the cause of diabetes .
being overweight seems to increase the body ' s demand for insulin .
age diabetes can affect people of all ages but the chances of its developing increase with age .
most non - insulin dependent diabetics are older than 40 years of age .
look around - you ' ll see them everywhere :
you can help by doing the following :
rhymes help children see how letters make the same pattern in different words .
play ' odd one out games ' .
for example , which word is the odd one in a list like cat , mat , dog , sat ?
play ' i - spy ' .
it is a great way of showing that every word begins with a letter .
encourage your child to choose a book for you to read to them .
some may want to get every word exactly right while other children will race to the end of a story .
try to respond to your child ' s needs and let them read at their own pace .
eventually , you will know in which ways your child needs more help .
some children may need to slow down and look more carefully at each word .
others will need to move the story along and not worry so much about their mistakes .
they should look at the pictures and remember what has happened in the story .
their ability to predict and guess accurately will gradually improve .
you can also help by doing the following :
make the most of books your child brings home from school .
there are many ways in which you can continue to play a very important role in the development of your child ' s reading .
you can help by doing the following :
read a story together , then read it out again , missing out words .
a different word that means the same thing may be suggested .
that ' s good .
it shows that your child is thinking about the story and words .
if they read or write out the part they know , you can finish it letter by letter .
write out long words and cut them into bite - sized pieces .
get your child to put the pieces back together the right way round .
when your child reads and gets a word wrong , let them finish the line before you put them right .
children often realise what the word should be , go back and correct themselves .
if your child does n ' t know a word in a sentence , get them to say ' something ' instead .
they can often work it out from other words around it .
try to keep cool ! it ' s important not to get fed up if your child needs to practise things over and over again .
choosing books - help is at hand
choosing books for children can be a huge pleasure , or you might not know where to start .
you do n ' t want to put them off having fun when they ' re learning .
do n ' t worry if your child crosses words out when they ' re writing .
lots of children try out different spellings until they feel a word looks right .
write a story that your child has told you .
help them to make their own labels , notices , cards and books .
ask questions about the characters in the story .
you ( or they ) could write down some notes to help them remember all their ideas .
words are everywhere
some more ideas to help your child to read when you have n ' t got a book .
at breakfast time
look at the words on cereal packets , milk and fruit juice cartons .
get them to see how many words they can make out of the letters .
going to the shops
can your child put the words together with what ' s in the window ( hairdressers , shoes , and so on ) ?
you ' ll see advertising posters and place names .
your child can help you find things in the supermarket by reading out what ' s in the aisles .

you can help by doing the following :
it is recommended that whenever index of suspicion for diabetes is high , it is appropriate to seek full biochemical evaluation for a firm diagnosis .
practical point for every known diabetic , there is one unknown .
high index of suspicion is warranted to diagnose a symptom - less diabetes !
the variation observed in results is due to different methods used , criteria for diagnosis not being uniform .
remember the three ps :
pause - give her time to work it out ;
prompt - look for something in the word she knows , like the first letter ;
and praise - tell her when she ' s been successful .
does it matter ?

national literacy strategy
the government ' s ' national literacy strategy ' aims to raise standards of reading and writing for all children .
the summary of our finding is as follows : the overall prevalence is 1.8 per cent .
according to age group , the prevalence is as follows :
in india , the average male weight is 55 kg and the female , 48.5 kg .
among those detected to be diabetic , 31.5 per cent were overweight &gt; + 115 of ideal body weight .
rural / urban difference in prevalence of diabetes has also been observed from many other geographic areas .
it becomes overt when circumstances are propitious , and suppressed when unpro - pitious .
the school thinks your child has special educational needs
type i and type ii are two main variations in presentation of diabetes .
in clinical characterisation , type i or insulin dependent diabetes ( iddm ) usually affects children and young adults .
there is an absolute deficiency of insulin in such instances due to destruction of beta cells .
type ii or non - insulin dependent diabetes ( niddm ) affects adults or those above the age of 35 years or so .
many of such instances may have no symptoms related to high blood glucose but may be detected to be diabetic because of :
the lea will send you details of state mainstream and special schools in the area .
this can be the school they already go to .
special schools usually take children with particular types of special needs .
many ordinary schools also have special provision for children with particular needs .
for example , they may have good access for physically - disabled pupils or special teaching for pupils with hearing or sight difficulties or dyslexia .
these are acid radicals and inducemetabolicketoacidosis .
theindividual will , besides aggravation of symptoms of diabetes , now manifest :
nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ;
diagnosis is possible by examining urine for ketones ; this is possible by a chemical test or testape or ketostik .
this is a serious condition and if not attended to immediately can be fatal .
while awaiting this the individual should :
get urine tested for ketones and blood for glucose every four to six hours ;
have somebody around to assist and watch one ' s condition .
this vast network of blood vessels is about 70,000 miles long .
the functioning of the various organs is affected due to this reduction in blood circulation .

what is breast awareness ?
breast awareness is a part of general body awareness .
it is a process of getting to know your own breasts and becoming familiar with their appearance .
learning how your breasts feel at different times will help you to know what is normal for you .
the normal breast
before the menopause normal breasts feel different at different times of the month .
the milk - producing tissue in the breasts becomes active in the days before a period starts .
in some women , the breasts at this time feel tender and lumpy , especially near the armpits .
after the menopause activity in the milk - producing tissue stops .
normal breasts feel soft , less firm and not lumpy .
know what is normal for you
any puckering or dimpling of the skin .
discomfort or pain in one breast that is different from normal , particularly if new and persistent .
any lumps , thickening or bumpy areas in one breast or armpit which seem to be different from the same part of the other breast and armpit .
this is very important if new .
nipple change .
nipple discharge , new for you and not milky .
bleeding or moist reddish areas which do n ' t heal easily .
any change in nipple position - pulled in or pointing differently .
know what to look and feel for
what to do if you find a change
there can be many reasons for changes in the breast .
most of them are harmless but all of them need to be checked as there is a small chance they could be the first sign of cancer .
if you are aware of any change in your breast from what is normal for you , tell your doctor without delay .
if there is a cancer present , the sooner it is reported , the more simple treatment is likely to be .
those who have gone had a hysterectomy are also in need of this test .
inquire about this from your doctor .
the gap depends upon your local health authority .
who performs the test ?
generally your doctor will examine you .
if you do n ' t want a male doctor to examine you , then there are female doctors and practice nurses who are trained for the smear test .
the examination may be done in family planning clinic well woman clinic .
the leg muscles may get cramps , weakness or discomfort on walking .
high blood pressure as blood flows through the body , it puts pressure on the inside walls of thearteries .
occasional brief periods of increased blood pressure may not be a problem .
however , consistently high blood pressure can affect the heart , the brain and the kidney .
when blood pressure is high , blood is pushed against the artery walls with extra force .
the heart has to work harder now and it increases in size .
frequently you will hear that the result is ok and will be called for your next smear text after 3 to 5 years .
sometimes you may be advised to repeat the test in a laboratory .
why do i need another smear test ?
there may be many reasons .
generally there is an insufficient sample to test in the laboratory ; this is a common reason .
or there may be a slight infection .
it shows some major changes in the smear cells .
observe minutely and note any changes in your breast that you did n ' t see or feel before .
observe
when you are ready for a bath , lower your arms and stand in front of a mirror and observe repeatedly and minutely
raise your arms over your head and observe again minutely .
put your hands on your hips and press them until the muscles of your breast become irritated and tensile .
observe minutely all aspects of your breasts from all sides .
observe them from downward ; bow forwards and observe the shape of the breasts .
do you observe anything ?
be cautious .
when you test or observe your breasts for the first time :
check the shape first
if one breast is larger than the other then it is abnormal .
spotting changes
change in shape
change in outer shape ( are they flat ? )
is there any cyst or hardness ?
veins which are swelled up more than normal
any changes in nipples ( like deformed or sunken or diverted )
the surrounding area of the nipple is become reddish with some itching
the secretion of blood or water from nipples ( in some women it is normal to secret milk unwillingly )
any kind of change causing irritation or excitement
any change which you felt new that you had never felt before
how do i test my breast ?
while bathing , rub some soap on your palm and massage it onto your breast ; it can slip easily .
do n ' t tighten your breasts with your hand or any other means ; do n ' t put force on your breast with your hand .
keep your fingers close together and straight , and lose your finger on the right side .
push the breast gently and carefully .
check your right breast with your left hand and your left breast with your right hand .
make sure your breasts are pear shaped and their nipples are oriented to your arms .
check each part of your breast , towards the arms and beneath the nipples too .
any problems ?
if you feel any new change or any other problem then consult your doctor or nurse .
breast testing by mammography
mammography means taking an x - ray of your breast .
by doing this we can diagnose the minute changes in breast tissue which can cause cancer or an initial stage of cancer .
most changes in breasts are not causes of cancer .
any change in your breast
continuous watery secretion from vagina
bleeding between menstrual cycle
bleeding during intercourse
bleeding after menopause
a management system for hazard analysis
a summary of the main points from the department of health publication
you will have to do some planning and preparation before developing the system .
do n ' t try and introduce the system at once .
to set up an assured safe catering system , you will need to decide how many people will be needed .
this will depend on the size of your business ; in a small business , this may be only one or two .
in larger businesses , it may be necessary to set up a team .
you should include people who can recognise hazards , control measures and the critical control points without too much difficulty .
this means that they will need to understand each step of the catering operation as well as food hygiene principles .
you may also need to bring other people on to the team , depending on which step in the operation you are looking at .
stage 3 : drawing up a flow diagram .
a simplified example is shown on the next page .
stage 4 : listing the hazards ( a ) to checking the system ( f ) .
in insulin dependent diabetics , patient is prone to develop ketosis ; so insulin has to be administered to save life .
the hierarchy of aims of diabetes treatment are as follows :
to alleviate symptoms due to diabetes .
to secure the best blood glucose control appropriate to the patient ' s age and other circumstances .
to encourage self - reliance and self - care and to prevent psychological complications and ensure optimum quality of life .
milk and milk products have carbohydrates , protein , and some fat .
carbohydrates : even though diabetes involves a problem with the body ' s use of carbohydrates , the latter are still important for a balanced diet .
between 55 and 65 per cent of caloric requirements should come from carbohydrates .
therefore , sugar quickly builds up in the bloodstream and may spill into the urine .
most of the daily carbohydrates should be from coarse cereals or complex carbohydrates .
in this proportion no worsening effect on glucose tolerance is observed .
fructose : the sugar found in fruits causes blood sugar to rise much more slowly than does table sugar .
organise everything in one place , i . e . insulin , alcohol , am cotton ball . note syringe marking units : 40 or 100 units 2 .
any diabetic , especially when treatment is neglected .
gradually over daystakes more time .
however , the fact that there was no legal obstacle to his becoming a barrister was enough encouragement to badruddin .
throughout his life though badruddin was to recall these fine words and treat them as a promise to be made good by the british government .
perhaps the first time that he did so was when he made up his mind to try to become a barrister .
rapid industrial development also led to the continuous expansion of urban population needing more and more food .
an extensive search for new and secure sources of raw material and food - stuffs now began and covered the entire world .
this capital was , moreover , increasingly concentrated in fewer and fewer banks and corporations and trusts and cartels .
outlets had to be found for the investment of this capital .
the struggle for division of the world into colonies was now transformed into a struggle for the redivision of the colonial world .
it now began a vigorous effort to consolidate its control over its existing empire and to extend it further .
it was necessary that to render this capital secure from economic and political dangers , british rule over india be clamped down even more firmly .
this was frankly recognised by contemporary british officials and statesmen .
india also performed another important function in the british scheme for empire .
the indian army was the chief instrument for the expansion and consolidation of british power in africa and asia .
it also served along with the british navy as the chief instrument for the defence of the british empire on a global scale .
the result was a costly standing army that absorbed nearly 52 per cent of the indian revenues in 1904 .
all talk of educating indians for self - government died out during this period , till it was revived in 1918 under the impact of the indian national movement .
the transformation of india , begun during the preceding period , continued during the third stage .
growing taxation in a stagnant economy invariably carries with it the penalty of popular revolt .
india provided employment to thousands of middle - class englishmen and nearly one - third of its revenues was spent in paying salaries to englishmen .
above all , indian economy and social development were completely subordinated to british economy and social development .
in fact , the two processes were interdependent in terms of cause and effect .
the selfish policies followed by the british rulers in india affected most india ' s agriculture and her agrarian classes and her trade and industries .
the impact of the policies in the cultural and social fields was also very powerful .
but these new features did not represent a change towards modernisation or in the right direction .
whatever the name of the system , it was the peasant cultivators who suffered .
this process is referred to as sub - infeudation .
the new landlords and zamindars had even less of a link with land than the old zamindars .
instead of taking the trouble to organise a machinery for rent collection , they merely sublet their rights to intermediate rent receivers .
the new system did not at all permit the development of agriculture .
new social classes appeared at the top as well as at the bottom of the social scale .
there arose landlords , intermediaries and moneylenders at the top and tenants - at - will , share - croppers and agricultural labourers at the bottom .
the new pattern was neither capitalism nor feudalism , nor was it a continuation of the old mughal arrangement .
it was a new structure that colonialism evolved .
it was semi - feudal and semi - colonial in character .
agricultural practices remained unchanged .
better types of implements , good seeds and various types of manures and fertilizers were not introduced at all .
the composition and character of the foreign trade was unbalanced .
last but not least , the foreign trade affected the internal distribution of income adversely .
there was , almost a complete absence of heavy capital goods and chemical industries without which rapid and autonomous industrial development could hardly occur .
no technological research was carried on in the country .
to sum up , india underwent a commercial transformation and not an industrial revolution .
the distribution of industries was extremely lop - sided under the british rule , and concentrated in a few regions and cities of the country .
this gave rise to wide regional disparities in income patterns , economic development , and social stratification .
the per capita income was low and unemployment widespread .
twenty of the years from 1860 to 1908 were years of famine .
according to one estimate , nearly 29 million people died during famines from 1854 to 1901 .
before that india was no more backward than the countries of the western europe .
britain subordinated the indian economy to its own economy and determined the basic social trends in india according to her own needs .
modern ideas spread through many channels ; political parties , the press , pamphlets and the public platform .
this role is , however complex and full of contradictions .
if the foreign government neglected primary and school education , it turned hostile to higher education early , that is , soon after 1858 .
a few other aspects of indian education arising out of its colonial character should be noted .
one was the complete neglect of modern technical education which was a basic necessity for the rise and development of modern industry .
the total disruption of old land and rural relationships upset the caste balance in the countryside .
in the beginning the policies of the colonial state also encouraged social reform .
efforts were made to modernise indian society in order to enable the economic penetration of the country and the consolidation of british rule .
the modernisation of indian culture had one other important facet .
they blindly imitated western life and culture instead of carefully assimilating their positive , humanist , and scientific features .
they did not realise that modern ideas and culture could be best imbibed by integrating them into indian culture .
british writers and statesmen also used their criti - cism of indian culture and society to justify british political and economic domination over india .
later , when the other boys were busy avoiding lessons and playing self - invented games , badruddin was , earnestly and solemnly , ' pursuing his studies ' .
badruddin was left to accost the mild old man who was no teacher , and a total stranger .
this story merely shows that badruddin himself never passed through that phase of playful naughtiness which is so much a part of normal growing up .
in actual age he was still a boy when he went england to become a barrister .
for some years before that he had thought carefully about his future career .
he had worked out his chances , not only for qualifying for the bar , but his chances of a successful practice .
his brother camruddin was the first indian solicitor , and he could depend on his help in getting work .
many indians felt it necessary to prove their ' fitness ' for self - government by glorifying their remote past .
others held up the imitators of western culture to ridicule and opposed the very introduction of modern ideas and culture .
they believed that the best way to preserve cultural autonomy was to look inwards once again .
even though this trend of thought remained in a minority , it had a certain influence over the people / especially the urban lower - middle classes .
british rule brought the entire geographical area of the country under a single administration .
it also unified the country by introducing a uniform system of law and government .
the introduction of modern methods of communication like railways , telegraphs , a modern postal system , development of roads and motor transport produced the same unifying effect .
the destruction of rural and local economic self - sufficiency and the growth of internal trade created conditions for the rise of a unified indian economy .
modern industries were all - india in their scope for both the sources of their raw materials and their markets embraced the entire country .
increasingly the economic lot of the indian people was getting inter - linked and india ' s economic life was becoming a single whole .
different classes and groups of indian society gradually discovered that the british rule was hampering their develoment in all basic aspects .
the peasantry was perhaps the chief victim of british colonialism .
the government took away a large part of its produce in the form of land revenue and other taxes .
it was soon caught in the firm clutches of the landlord and the moneylender .
the peasant found himself master neither of his land nor of the crops he produced ; nor even of his own labour power .
the result was that the average worker lived below the margin of subsistence .
in western europe the bureaucracy was as pro - capitalist in outlook as the capitalist class itself .
they gradually realised that they needed a nation - state and a government favourable to indigenous capitalists .
but after 1918 they began to support , mostly financially , the rapidly developing nationalist movement and individualist leaders .
the hindu and sikh communalists were equally willing to play into the hands of imperialism .
all of them , in their own separate ways , played an important role in frustrating gandhiji ' s efforts at presenting a united front at the conference .
the individual disobedience movement when gandhiji , afer his return protested to willingdon , he was met by an adamant attitude .
this was an attitude quite distant from the spirit of the lahore congress .
yet it still threatened a renewal of civil disobedience .
government disregarded the threat .
on 4 january 1932 , a fresh batch of congress leaders including gandhiji and vallabhbhai patel , the congress president , were arrested .
now jail beatings on political prisoners and attempts to treat them as common criminals became more common than ever before .
in the 1930 ' s the congress became more and more firm in its stand against imperialism in any part of the world .
the congress openly supported national movements in the countries of asia and africa .
by this time fascism was emerging in italy , germany and japan as a new threat to democracy .
in its own fanatical way fascism was one type of imperialism .
it was also racialist in concept .
the congress , therefore , gave unqualified support to anti - fascist struggles in ethiopia , spain and czechoslovakia .
in 1937 japan attacked china .
in this he spoke not only for the congress but for the entire nation .
nehru stressed that india would not participate in any war between imperialist powers .
then , they took her to a celestial palace and laid her upon a golden bed .
learned brahmins interpreted the dream as a sign that mahamaya would soon give birth to a great and noble son .
taking the prince , who was hardly a day old , in his arms he exclaimed with joy , " indeed he will be a great one ! "
" he will be a world famous teacher , " said the third .
" only if he renounces the world to become an ascetic , " added a fourth .
fame as a teacher did not interest shuddhodhana .
he wanted his only son to follow the kshatriya tradition and become a world conqueror .
so shuddhodhana decided to try and keep his son always happy and only surrounded him with what was beautiful .
one was for summer ; it was lined with tall trees for shade which caught the cool breeze .
another was for winter , with open avenues bright with sunlight and warmth .
yet another was for the rainy season with spacious halls for indoor games and sports .
if england was the workshop in which badruddin was collecting the tools of his future career , what else did he pick up there ?
his academic successes gave him a healthy self - confidence .
at the same time there were many things about the english that he learnt to like and respect .
according to the custom of the time yashodhara ' s father organised an archery contest to select a suitable husband for his daughter .
then aiming high , they hit distant targets with remarkable accuracy .
but siddhartha did not allow himself to be tempted and continued his meditation .
as a last resort mara sent his three daughtersdesire , pleasure , and passion to dance before siddhartha and tempt him .
he continued to be lost in deep meditation .
" here comes gautama our old teacher , " observed one of them .
" he who left us for the worldly life , " scoffed another .
at that time there lived in varanasi a wealthy young man named yasa .
the buddha took great interest in the development of the sangha .
with kashyapa five hundred of his disciples joined the sangha .
soon afterwards , the buddha visited rajagriha , the magadhan capital , accompanied by the monks who were his followers .
so pleased was the king with the teachings of the master that he exclaimed , " i have now been blessed with everything .
the buddha was seated on an elevated platform .
the buddha accepted the gift .
" what does he teach ? "
" this is the truth that i have been searching for , " exclaimed sariputra .
he wanted him to come to kapilavastu , even if for a short visit .
the minister and his men arrived when the buddha was preaching to a large gathering of people .
he became a prominent member of the sangha .
as a girl she had become a follower of the buddha along with her father and his entire household .
when she grew up , vishakha was married to purnavarthana , the son of another rich banker , migara , also of shravasti .
finally migara agreed .
" i do not ask , sister , for your family or caste .
if you have any water left , give some to me . i wish to drink , " was all that ananda replied .
the buddha did not recognise the division of society into different castes .
" in that case it would belong to the man who offered it , " answered the young man .
gautami went from house to house in search of the handful of mustard seed .
my teachings and the sangha will be your guide , " the buddha consoled him .
here he asked ananda to spread a clean sheet in the shade of two sal trees .
afterwards he met the malla nobles who had come to pay their respects to the learned teacher .
after they left he rested .
it was his custom to walk part of the way home every evening while his carriage was sent ahead to wait for him .
while badruddin was a student in england , his own eyes and health began to fail .
by next year , however , he was ready to go back to work , and he resumed reading for the bar .
for some time he worked in the office of a london solicitor , and he attended the law courts to watch famous lawyers conducting their cases .
even the drum is notalways restricted to music .
i the discussions so far reveal the necessity for a major definition of a musical instrument .
there is an oraon song in which a boy says , i on the fort hill , i have seen beans spreading andripe .
similarly , literature from all other languages could be examined for a fuller study .
the data are vast and varied , extending in time and space .
among the earliest evidences of this kind are finds from the indus valley scripts and heiroglyphs .
we also have illustrations in many cave paintings - right from the prehistoric ones in madhya pradesh to ajanta .
all this is too big a storehouse for any one person to handle .
how many kinds of instruments are there ?
are they to be grouped according to the material they are made of ?
today , bharata ' s four major groups are accepted .
however , for technical purposes a detailed depth classification is necessary .
the kuzhal was a flute and the maddalam a drum .
as early as 200 b . c . bharata described in detail the kutapa for his drama .
we still have a number of such ensembles of various types and sizes with us .
the panchamaha - sabda was already referred to .
besides these there are temple kutapa such as the ashladasa vadya which may not really have eighteen instruments as the name implies .
instruments in the police and armed forces are almost entirely foreign .
it reveals the highly eclectic nature of indian society and the hazards of a journey in the monorail of textbook study .
our society , like any other , today is the confluence of many tributaries and should be viewed as such .
it is not unreasonable to assume that idiophones might have been the oldest musical instruments used by mankind .
naturally , the primeval ghana vadya is the human body itself ; particularly all the rhythmic acts and movements it involves in .
hands are clapped , or thighs and hips are struck with the hands to accompany dance and music .
immediately , a ghana vadya has been created and instruments such as clappers , castanets , danda , bells and cymbals developed .
that is why you will not find many of them in classical music .
however , there are exceptions like the jaltarang and the kastha tarang which , within severe limits , are adequate for melodicmusic also .
perhaps the simplest instruments in this class are rods , rings , jingles and clappers .
sticks - danda or kolu - can be seen almost anywhere .
one striking variety of this dance is the pinnal kolattam ( south india ) or the gomph ( gujarat ) .
each dancer holds in one hand the kolu or dandiya and with the other hand a rope or a long ribbon .
( 2 ) the villu kottu or ona villu is a small idiophone from kerala .
in beating the drum , which lies with the slit at the top , the bucks and boys of the ' mourung ' line up along it .
under each kastha a tube of determined length and diameter is attached , to give proper resonance and volume to the sound .
the tokka of assam is a primitive ghana vadya put to both musical and non - musical uses .
in our own country there are many different types : the ruga braiya , the doddu rajan , the kokkara and so on .
the wall of the instrument is often slit to some length to give the stridulator more resonance .
the dancers , who were of both sexes , smeared themselves with holy ashes and wore rudrakasha bead garlands .
but more often than not it is rare to see a cowrie in the examples and specimens that one comes across whether in texts , sculptures or actual instruments .
however , the raponi of assam is really a sukti vadya .
it is simply a bamboo stick , not a tube , of a meter ' s length with serrations along it .
there are some bells where the rim is stroked producing a continuous high pitched sound .
it is quite possible that the first bell shaped instruments were dried fruit shells and floral buds .
it is a dried fruit and a few of them are tied together and shaken in rhythm .
the baigas of madhya pradesh tie a set of dried pumpkins to their waists when dancing .
the kaniyari fruit is used by the oraons .
it is never beaten on the mouth .
further , by manipulating his abdomen , the player can elicit various volumes and tonal colours out of the ghatam .
membranophones are called avanaddha vadya in musical literature in india .
avanaddha means therefore , an instrument wherein a vessel or a frame is covered with leather is an avanaddha vadya .
there are two crafts which have been associated with and have generally determined the evolution of drums .
one of the earliest ways of making a drum was to fell a tree and scoop out the inside , thus obtaining an easily available hollow cylinder .
this could be covered with skin on one or two sides producing a drum .
perhaps , the earliest of such instruments were very large and stood vertically on the ground like trees .
this being the case , it is obvious that only the top face could have been covered .
in kerala , for example , palm or coconut trees - in which this region abounds - are cut down , the trunk hollowed out and covered with leather .
but with the development of mechanical aids like lathes , wood has been shaped into smaller vessels of different shapes as in the tabla and the mridanga .
the alingya drums were embraced , meaning perhaps that they were held under one arm and played with the other .
there was another classification based on shape .
the yava or barleyi shaped drums were also barrel drums and they may have been similar to the present day mridanga .
even today large instruments of this kind are found in various areas with a number of tribes and rural groups .
when hanuman is caught and punished by ravana , the king ' s orders are announced to the sound of the conch and the bheri .
one face was played with the hand and the other with a kona .
( these words are applied also to barrel drums .
) one interesting variety , generally seen in andhra and tamil nadu , is the pamba or pambai , a folk musical instrument .
in the simpler varieties , both drums are made of wood .
they are the sri khole of bengal and the pung of manipur .
from bengal it seems to have travelled further east to assam and manipur , as also to orissa .
indeed , the association of this drum with the keertan and bhakti ( adoration ) is so deep that it is called sri khole .
the body could be of wood or burnt clay with the two heads made of multiple membranes as in the mridanga .
the pung used in manipur ' s dance and music is smaller than the sri khole .
this is typically , and most likely exclusively , met within the nagasvaram or melam ensembles .
the change in tension so achieved alters the pitch of the parchments and very attractive tonal effects can thus be produced .
the mouth itself has two thin midribs of coconut palm nailed across it and they add a pleasing buzz to the sound .
this is also connected to the shoulder strap from which the instrument hangs .
the player now employs a well practised manipulation of the drum .
while beating it with a stick in one hand , the other hand is inserted under the threads .
usually the body is of bell metal or brass and the fixing of the leather is also more complicated than in the tumbaknari or even the ghumat .
( 17 ) there is a large class of avanaddha vadya derivable from shallow pans of various sizes and depths as well as from large or small conical vessels .
the gradations in forms and dimensions are many and it may not be very pertinent in a book of this kind to go into finer classifications .
we shall group them all as qne whole family and study some representative members !
the drumseems to have been popular and venerated as well , aswould have been gathered from earlier references to it inthis study .
the dundubhi is also prominent as a martialinstrument in the two epics and almost all subsequentliterature .
the present versions of the dundubhi are thedhumsa , the nissan , the nagara and so on , all met with innon - classical music .
yet , in spite of its weight and size , it is hung from the shoulders and the drummer dances about beating it loudly with a pair of sticks .
the nissan which is as old as the ramayana is found in gujaratand rajasthan , though in very different forms .
references to the nissan occur also in medieval hindi poetry and in a musical work written in the thirteenth century .
the dundubhi is kept also in temples , to be beaten during worship or to announce prayers .
usually there are two conical bowl drums struck with sticks , the pair being known as nagara or naqara .
the smaller of the twois higher in pitch and is the madi or female ; the larger witha deeper tone is called the nar or the male .
the tabla is invariably made of wood and is a vessel broader at the bottom and narrower at the top .
this ring of leather known in hindi as the chanti or the kinara , is stitched firmly to aleather braid , the gajra .
the pudi is made and fixed like in the tabla , except that the syahi is not in the centre but is placed to one side .
also , the bowl is of metal , though formerly it used to be of wood or clay .
( 19 ) there were drums which had more than two faces though they are seldom , if at all , seen now .
in ancient musicological literature one often comes across the term tripushkara which is interpreted in different ways .
one meaning could be that it referred to the three major avanaddha vadya : the mridanga , the panava and the dardura .
the dilvara temple in rajasthan , belonging to the eleventh century , has a relief showing a musician playing a four headed drum .
the panchamukha vadya , seen in some southern temple sculptures , is played today in a few places during worship .
these simple mechanisms obtain in western drums also .
this defect is got over by numerous contrivances in the more advanced membranophones like the pakhavaj , the mridanga and the tabla .
the first step is to stretch the skin uniformly .
in classical music texts the name for these is patakshara or merely pata or akshara .
one of them , played by the worshippers of mariyamma in south india , is the burburi which is a cylindrical two faced instrument .
while the right hand beats the rhythm with a straight stick ; the left hand rubs the membrane on the other side with curved twig .
which were the early types and where in the world have they been found ?
where and when in india did the first sushira vadya come into existence ?
this was the first flute .
like the drums , wind instruments - particularly trumpets and flutes - have strong socio - religious associations and functions .
both these instruments have very strong phallic significances in primitive as well as later civilized societies .
in some aboriginal human clans if a woman saw a trumpet she was killed , because it was a male .
as a matter of fact , some ethnologists are of the opinion that it is this masculinity which makes the trumpet an inciter in war .
in new guinea , for instance , some flutes of nearly six meters length have a special function in certain sexual rites .
it is for this reason it is even questionable whether instruments of this class can be called wind instruments at all .
the materials that suggest themselves to us are animal horns , dried bones , conches , bamboo and hollow shoots of trees .
we shall see how each of these has been put to use as a wind instrument .
sumerian civilization had the si - im ; si meant a horn and im was wind .
it is a small bamboo length , of approximately fifteen centimeters , one end of which is open and the other end closed .
obviously only very simple tunes can be played on the instrument .
however , the tube bears usually four holes which are manipulated to give simple melodies .
the player creates melodies by closing and opening the finger holes on the body of the instrument .
his correctness , formality and seriousness did not leave him even in his home , or among his family .
there was no dearth of friends , that is , people with whom there was mutual respect and admiration , and people who sought his advice and help .
he may not charge either a very large fee , or a very small one .
these traditions badruddin helped to establish in the bombay high court , both by his own example and by putting moral pressure on others .
also our artists and audiences still prefer the bamboo flute , because of its mellow quality , to metallic tubes .
the word venu was advisedly used here to show how this and many other instruments get their names .
in this case , it means just bamboo and the connection between the flute and the word is patent .
ancient sculptures and murals , as can be expected , abound with illustrations of this instrument .
( 25 ) the flutes and trumpets described thus far had nomechanical parts , either to produce the sound or to control fig .
there is one more single beating reed that needs our notice , even though it is not found in all parts of the country .
this is the pepa of assam played at the bihu or spring dances .
it consists of two bamboo pipes nearly twenty centimeters long , tied together with finger holes .
one end has the reed which is either covered by a bamboo tube or is left bare .
this end is put into the mouth and blown to produce the sound .
28 pepa shehnai and nagasvaram which are so sophisticated that they are heard and appreciated on international concert platforms .
the two - reed instruments in the subcontinent have been problematic in many ways .
the shehnai finds a place in our literary works from the thirteenth century and is likely to be connected with the zurna of central and west asia .
there are some names which have interesting sidelights on the transference of epithet : the melam and olaga are two such words .
both these have a lexical meaning of group , court , ( particularly of overlords and kings ) .
since among the ensembles played here the nagasvaram is very important , the instrument itself is called the melam and olaga ( in tamil , kannada and telugu ) .
there is thus one key to every reed and only the notes needed can be played by depressing the related keys .
this instrument has been the case of much controversy and acrimony amongst scholars and musicians , both in official and non - official quarters .
badruddin had a straightness of vision which enabled him to discriminate between those which were the key factors of the case and those which were marginal or irrelevant .
he could never be deflected into wasting time or energy on weak arguments .
he knew that one sound solid reason , especially if it is based on principle , can be irrefutable .
in one case badruddin was defending a young indian who was accused of trying to bribe a british ics officer .
he decided on his best line of reasoning , and never swerved from it , never made the mistake of taking two or three unconnected , though valid arguments .
the harmonium is not constructed to generate such razor sharp differences .
on the contrary : its keyboard necessitates a process of democratization - what is technically known as equal temperament .
in other words , on a harmonium tones lose their individual uniqueness and become one in a crowd .
further , since there is one - reed - to - one - note relationship only discontinuous and staccato melodies are possible .
tata vadya are so many in number and variety that it is futile to search for their beginnings and sometimes even classification becomes complicated .
a bamboo piece of nearly seventy - five centimeters length is nailed or screwed to a side of the body on the outside .
the singer holds the tuntune in the hand and plucks the string with his forefinger , to give the base note and a kind of rhythm .
a very common musical situation in which the tuntune is found is the tarnasha play and povada ballad singing of maharashtra .
coming back to the ek tar , the danda projects a little from the bottom side of the gourd .
a tiny thin bridge of wood or bamboo is placed on the resonator under the string .
the instrument is a companion to the beggar and the bhajan singers .
it is this luxuriance of tone that gives a background for any number of consonances and dissonances with the voice or other instruments in a concert .
the fruit is allowed to dry , usually by hanging it well above a smoky fire for some years so that it gets ' sufficiently seasoned .
it is then cut to the required shape and the desiccated inner pulp removed .
the cut open part is now covered with a thin plank of wood and the resonator is ready .
there are four metallic strings in the instrument and these are plucked with the fingers to provide the drone ; no melody is played on the tamboora .
the process of fretting reduced all tonal measurements to their positions on the string .
this naturally led to another system founded on fret positions and to a theory known as the mela paddhati ( the method of scales ) .
the most popular hypothesis is that bow shaped polychords , known as harps in english could be traced to the hunter ' s bow .
in other words , it is a struck bow .
the vadyam is very simple and is made of a bow , nearly two to three meters long .
he told his captors - without , of course revealing the source of his information - and he was set free .
the final hundredth one was tied by the yajamana ( the house - holder ) who was the patron of the sacrifice .
in later literature this instrument is generally equated with the sata tantri veena which means the .
some are of the opinion that the vana veena might have been the prototype of the kashmiri santoor which will be described later .
animal sinew was also used for similar purposes and these have been replaced by metal wires in most cases .
it may be recalled that the tamil word for tata vadya was narampu karuvi , and narampu means animal gut .
the major stringed instrument described here was the yazh .
but was it different from the contemporary aryan polychord veenas described earlier ?
in some literary examples the words yazh and veena are used in juxtaposition and are used in the same context .
this is more so when we see that even the constructional details of the yazhs and the sanskrit veenas were almost the same .
( 38 ) most probably the vil yazh was the first of these narampu karuvis .
the makara yazh , then , might have travelled to south india either directly from west asia or from that area via greece .
tamil nadu had also the adi yazh , the first yazh .
legends say that it was played to win over rakshasas or the evil ones during the first yuga , the krita yuga , the first era of the world .
it was said to have one thousand strings arranged in five octaves with two hundred in each !
how far this was a real instrument and how far the number ' one thousand ' was a hyperbole we do not know .
this like the santoor , is also a wooden box on which are mounted strings .
in dimensions it is much smaller than its sister and has no bridges .
they are plucked with fingers wearing metallic wire plectra .
this near revolution is one of the greatest mutations in our music history and is closely dependent on the evolution of instruments .
the subject , though extremely fascinating , is outside the scope of this book .
to produce a raga a glass ball is pressed and moved over them , like the kamrika in the eka tantri .
both from its construction and manner of handling it is clear that this zither is a descendent of the eka tantri .
the first was a great favourite with musicians during the middle ages and the second one was the reigning veena in hindustani music till a few years ago .
these and other types of fretted zithers could be refinements of more primitive ones like the memerajan of the savaras .
instrument is very much smaller and has only seven flat frets .
while the fingers of one hand pluck the strings the other stops them over the frets .
the been was played by men and women in royal courts and rural settings as can be seen from innumerable miniature paintings of north india .
bilas khan is considered to be the one who popularised the rabab and the other two the rudra veena .
no indian judge , in other words , was empowered to try a european .
it was contrary to the ideas of justice no european could expect justice at the hands of a ' native ' magistrate .
badruddin had already been in correspondence with officials of the government about this .
he had ended by saying , " i think that . . . it is highly impolitic to introduce questions of race in the administration of justice .
the hon ' ble mr m . d . jayakar who was a young barrister at the time later wrote :
to the shy struggling junior , he was the acme of helpfulness .
to the arrogant and slipshod , he was crushing in reproof . "
mr jayakar tells the story of a senior english barrister who mispronounced indian names , confusing the words bai and bhai .
" mr smith , badruddin said to the barrister from the bench , " you have been in this country for several years .
you should know by this time that bhai denotes a male and bai a female .
badruddin in fact set great store on common sense , and had little use for mere legalities .
this principle of impartiality held even when lord curzon himself paid an unplanned visit to badruddin ' s courtroom .
it is difficult to discuss any of the more important cases here since they were complicated in a legal sense .
this was such a frightful charge and circumstantial evidence against him was so strong that no judge was willing to grant him bail .
badruddin ' s own confrontation with the british had always been open and clear , and he was certainly no friend to violence or any subversive activities .
nevertheless , he had the fairness , and perhaps even more , the courage , to release mr tilak on bail .
but perhaps this story should be told a little more fully .
tilak ' s article , which could be interpreted as an incitement to political murder , was thought to be responsible for this .
tilak was arrested and charged with sedition .
the whole point of asking for the deposit is to make sure that the accused does not run away before his trial .
tilak ' s solicitor made three applications for bail before various judges , indian as well as english .
seeing his chance when badruddin tyabji was in the court , he made a fourth attempt to get bail for his client .
the advocate - general who was opposing the plea for bail on behalf of the government was closely questioned .
badruddin said to him :
what you say is , that the accused should be forthcoming at the trial you wish really only to secure his presence ? "
i think , therefore , i should best exercise my judgement if i admitted the accused on bail . "
badruddin started his public life , very suitably , on home ground : that is , in the affairs of bombay city .
at that time the entire city of bombay was administered by one commissioner .
he was not answerable to any committee , but only to a controller of accounts .
this meant that the city of bombay was managed according to the whims and fancies of a single person .
the first commissioner was a man called arthur crawford , after whom the great bombay market was called .
even the large social gatherings at his home were unusual for the time , in that they included members of every community .
but we must return to the affairs of bombay city .
two years afterwards these elections were held , and badruddin , phirozeshah mehta and telang all three were elected to the council , among other well - known citizens .
what the governor had suggested was an important advisory body .
what badruddin wantedand finally got , was an elected body with responsibility and authority .
badruddin ' s work in the legislative council was more important than it was realised .
they were indefatigable in seizing upon every public question and expressing their views with ' undaunted and fearless advocacy ' , but also ' with moderation and judgement ' .
their activities exploited every opportunity meetings , memorials , petitions , addresses and ' protests for the public good ' .
when a man is sharp and quick about the present , he is called clever .
but when his mental sweep includes everything there is , and also extends into a distant future , then he can be called wise .
badruddin ' s leadership was always wise , and people learnt to trust his judgement .
we have already discussed the ilbert bill at great length .
a far more important matter , although it never became an excitable public issue , was the question of the age limit for the indian civil service .
so that , in effect , what this rule meant was that india would permanently be administered only by englishmen .
badruddin spoke and wrote on this subject so forcefully and persuasively that the government agreed to raise the age to twenty - two .
every good manager knows that criticism and faultfinding by itself is often useless unless it is also accompanied by praise and appreciation for the right things .
the british were left in no doubt that indians admired lord ripon and his policies .
the women of his family were always treated with much respect and consideration .
his daughters were taught gujarati , urdu , arabic and persian , but not english .
his sons were made to study gujarati , urdu , and arabic , before being launched into english .
they continued to proclaim him just what he happened to be , an indian muslim from cambay .
this richness and diversity of cultures which obtained in india was a constant source of pride to badruddin , and he referred to it often .
at the end of the madras session , he explained his feelings :
this wild speech and the atmosphere it created was a great set - back to badruddin ' s careful , idealistic work .
without attempting to quarrel with sir syed , badruddin wrote to him in courteous , well - reasoned terms .
" at the time you delivered that speech , you were under the impression that the congress was composed of ' bengali babus ' alone .
if on the other hand , anything is proposed which you dislike , come and oppose it and under the rule above stated it must be dropped .
he answered a questioner at some length :
religious poison has always been more dangerous in india than gunpowder .
a rich , flourishing community does not need our services ; a poor and apparently downtrodden community arouses our conscience and our concern .
the muslims at that time certainly needed help more urgently than any other group in india .
the chief result of this was to make them cling even more obstinately to their old ways .
they all thought , felt and lived in more or less the same way .
but in bombay the story was very different .
for hundreds of years , the ruler or caliph of turkey had been looked upon by muslims all over the world as their spiritual leader .
the anjuman organised a public meeting at jami masjid in bombay in support of turkey and invited every muslim to attend .
it followed up its success by other useful acts .
it managed to get leave for muslims who were attending court , to go to the mosque for friday prayers .
it was written in urdu , and reads :
certainly , badruddin had no reason to be dissatisfied with the role he played in helping the muslim community of india .
the cure had to come from the muslims themselves .
many of their old customs and traditions were acting as strait jackets , preventing every kind of growth .
' do not flaunt your beauty and your ornaments before others ' , the quran said .
on one occasion tyab ali put this confidence to a severe test .
during the upheavals of the mutiny , a member of his community was accused of helping a mutineer and jailed in baroda .
he was quite clear that emotionally they must belong to their religion and their country , while intellectually they must belong to the world .
the older sons joined their father ' s business firm , which had a branch in le havre in france .
another son , camruddin , stayed in england for over seven years , and was the first indian to become a solicitor .
his influence was limited to the bombay presidency , and to what he could show by personal example .
as far as the political role of muslims was concerned , badruddin ' s views were diametrically opposed to those of sir syed ahmed khan .
sir syed , on the other hand , encouraged muslims to consider themselves as a group apart .
it was his policy never to get into an open quarrel .
discussion of educational aims is a tame and unexciting subject compared to the kind of hysteria which can be aroused by politics .
there were eight hundred delegates .
no doubt there have been many reasons for this , to which it is unnecessary to refer .
but there is one in regard to which i must say a few words .
most children in their formative years were in the sole charge of their mothers .
with ' a sick mind in sick body , " could these mothers give them the right sort of training and education ?
but the tide had turned and the turning point was , quite clearly , when badruddin tyabji made his opening speech at the mohammedan anglo - oriental educational conference .
having rocked the ship of orthodoxy , badruddin quickly followed up his advantage by proposing a resolution for the establishment of schools for girls .
the wail of purdah went up again .
how could girls be sent to schools ; it would mean walking through public places , and contact with men .
badruddin attacked them in a forthright manner .
the mohammedan anglo - oriental conference of 1903 , then , because it was presided over by badruddin tyabji , was a kind of breakthrough for the muslims .
if anything , he would be looked up to as courageous and resourceful .
it seems to me that to start this change of attitude among the muslims in india was badruddin ' s greatest contribution to the muslim community .
the conference was only the culmination and peak of his life - long efforts .
his household was godfearing and deeply religious ; but he incorporated several western customs which seemed good to him .
for instance , boys and girls were encouraged to play games together , go for walks , picnics , and rides together .
in many ways , the household had more in common with a typical upper - class victorian home , rather than a typical indian muslim home .
the furnishing and appearance of the house was given much importance as was the layout and maintenance of the large gardens .
spreading outwards from his family , he had an impact on the life and attitudes of all the muslims of bombay presidency .
he used his long years with the anjuman - i - islam and with the bombay presidency association to build up a tradition of intelligent thinking on public matters .
it is true that sir syed ahmed khan ' s hostility prevented badruddin ' s direct influence from being felt by the muslims of north india .
about two years after this important conference , badruddin died .
at the moment of his death , he had already accepted the permanent chief justiceship of bombay .
obviously if he had lived he could not have played any part in politics , and only a limited part in social reform .
it is difficult to resist the temptation to repeat that , had badruddin lived a few years longer , the history of indian muslims might have been happier .
how , in the final analysis , shall we sum up badruddin tyabji ' s life and the influence he had on those around him ?
and although , in the short term , the truth has many facets , the long - term truth is only one and unmistakable .
he was careful of the beauty , order and grace of his home which was something to which most indians were inclined to be indifferent .
he was an indian first , then a muslim , and finally a citizen of the world .
the struggle was over .
india was independent .
outside his palace gates , though , he was a nobody .
the whole country was managed , or rather ruled , by the east india company , which had originally come to india looking for trade .
the take - over had been gradual .
many of them mixed easily with them , made friends with indians and sometimes even took to indian customs and ways .
consequently , the new phase of british rule resulted in a steep rise in the burden of taxation on the indian peasant .
moreover , the free trade imposed on india was onesided .
for example , in 1824 , indian textiles paid duties ranging from 30 to 70 per cent .
in some cases duties in britain were as high as 400 per cent .
import duties on such products were removed only after their export to britain ceased altogether .
intense world - wide competition for markets now began .
secondly , several major technological developments occurred during the last quarter of the 19th century as a result of the application of scientific knowledge to industry .
the indian soldiers revolted against their british officers ; in some cases killing them and their families .
the fire , once begun , spread all over north india .
the number of people killed as a sequel to the mutiny was beyond counting , for the british reprisals were savage .
the indians , they felt , must be given a lesson for revolting against their foreign masters .
the country was saturated by the smell of fear and death .
soon afterwards , queen victoria was proclaimed empress of india and india formally became a british colony .
on the other hand , if this capital was invested abroad to produce mineral and agricultural raw materials , several objectives could be obtained .
once again the developed capitalist countries began a simultaneous search for areas where they could invest their surplus capital .
imperialism and expansion also served at this stage an important ideological and political purpose in the imperialist countries .
the french had their own faith in a ' civilising mission ' .
they were compelled to pay many illegal dues and cesses and were often required to perform forced labour or begar .
what is more important , whatever the name or nature of the revenue system , in effect the government came to occupy the position of the landlord .
this led to landlordism becoming the dominant feature of land relationships all over the country .
intermediate rent receivers also grew .
it was in the law courts , then , that the battle for equality must be fought .
in short , he persuaded his father to allow him to go to england at once .
he was to join the highway new park college and sit for the london matriculation examination before reading law .
this momentous decision to go to england to become a barrister took place when badruddin was fifteen years old , a year after the mutiny .
unfortunately , his equipment also included weak eyesight and poor health , a handicap which sometimes stopped him from working for long periods .
you will see that very little has been said about badruddin ' s childhood .
the british policy only helped to transfer resources from peasants and craftsmen to merchants , moneylenders and foreign capitalists .
a significant feature of india ' s foreign trade during this period was the constant excess of exports over imports .
we should not , however , imagine that it was to india ' s advantage .
these exports did not represent the future claims of india on foreign countries , but the drain of india ' s wealth and resources .
we must also remember that the bulk of foreign trade was in foreign hands and that almost all of it was carried on through foreign ships .
one of the most important consequences of british rule was the progressive decline and destruction of urban and rural handicraft industries .
the collapse of indigenous handicrafts followed .
the ruin of the indigenous industries and the absence of other avenues of employment forced millions of craftsmen to crowd into agriculture .
thus , the pressure of population on land increased .
development of modern industries british rule created conditions for the rise of a modern capitalist industry .
it created a wider all - india market by building a country - wide transport system .
in india a longstanding union had existed between rural industries and agriculture .
millions of craftsmen had been thrown out of employment .
the new revenue system had deprived millions of cultivators of their land .
from these facts we must not imagine that the foundation for an industrial revolution were being laid .
second , though the industrial progress during this phase was steady and continuous , it was extremely slow .
what was more important , even the limited development was not independent but was under the control of - foreign capital .
secondly , the structure of industry was such as to make its further development dependent on britain .
the winds of change would certainly have reached our shores , because india had never followed a closed - door policy .
through trade and travel she had for centuries established channels of communication not only with the countries of asia but also with europe .
but it might have been a slow process spread over a long period of time .
the intellectual life of the indian people began to undergo revolutionary changes influenced by such ideas as democracy and sovereignty of the people , rationalism , and humanism .
the christian missionaries also contributed towards the reform of indian society at this stage .
but very soon the basic conservative character and long - term interests of colonialism asserted themselves and colonial policies towards social reform were changed .
the social policy followed by the british , however , did not remain passive .
the new intellectual and political stirrings among the people also led to movements for social change .
led by men such as jotiba phule the lower castes built up powerful movements from the end of the 19th century .
women and tribal people too rose in defence of their rights .
in time the peasants became aware of the role of imperialism and saw that it was in the main responsible for their plight .
the artisans and craftsmen had also suffered much at the hands of imperialism .
their centuries - old sources of livelihood had been taken away without the development of any new , compensating avenues of employment .
consequently , they took a very active part in the anti - imperialist struggles of the twentieth century .
its outlook and interests were from the beginning all - india in character .
till 1911 there were no regulatory provisions concerning their hours of work .
there did not exist any kind of social insurance against sickness , old age , unemployment , accident or sudden death .
and a maternity benefit scheme , though a highly unsatisfactory one , came into operation in the 1930s .
they now set out to build up a nationalist political movement against imperialism .
they remained by and large loyal instruments of british rule to the end .
but even from these two social strata many individuals joined the national movement moved by the prevailing spirit of patriotism .
the aggressive proselytising propaganda of the christian missionaries also aroused their anger .
the result was that in the end two opposite trends emerged among the traditional intellectuals .
this movement was a national movement because it embraced within its fold all the different classes and groups of indian society .
apart from common interests against colonial rule , these classes and groups had their own contradictions with imperialism which brought them together in a common national movement .
there also existed mutual clashes of interests among them .
but they sank their mutual differences and united against the common enemy .
the soldiers thus transformed their mutiny into a revolutionary war .
the common people often fought with spears and axes , bows and arrows , lathis and scythes , and crude muskets .
an important element in the strength of the revolt of 1857 lay in hindu - muslim unity .
among the soldiers and the people as well as among the leaders there was complete co - operation as between hindus and muslims .
the hindu and muslim rebels and sepoys respected each other ' s sentiments .
nana sahib was defeated at kanpur .
thus the language of childhood is one ' s mother tongue it is the language of the home , of domestic and personal life .
the child learns it quickly and easily he can express himself , and generally function in it efficiently .
the second language , formally acquired , is for the outside world , the language in which to work and think .
this invaluable tool of the english language fell into badruddin ' s hands when he went to school in england .
badruddin had a quick , almost uncanny ear for languages .
he arrived in england , remember , with very little knowledge of english .
gandhiji expressed the wish that civil disobedience should not be offered en masse but individually , through specific actions .
later , some members of the chit - tagong groups in the andamans also switched over to communism .
it is in the context of these general trends that new alignments developed in the liberation struggle .
at the tripuri congress ( 1938 ) it was decided that the organisation should involve itself closely with the movements in the princely states .
to underline the common aspirations of all the people of india , the all india states ' peoples ' conference elected jawaharlal nehru as its president in 1939 .
there must , however , be tangible evidence to show that the allies meant what they professed .
specifically , britain should immediately give up her imperial and colonial domination of india and arrange for a reasonable quantum of self - government by the indians themselves .
but these feelings of the leaders and the people of india were neither heeded nor even taken into consideration .
on 3 september 1939 war was declared .
but it was scarcely likely to appeal to indian sentiments .
there were popular governments in the provinces .
but , possibly because of the very strong anti - fascist feelings among the leaders , the congress ' s immediate reaction to the declaration of war was conciliatory .
they make no distinction between nazism and the double autocracy that rules india .
" the world is indeed a happy place . "
but he wanted to see more .
" let us go that way , " he told channa .
an old man , with bent back came hobbling along , supported by a stick .
" who is that ? " exclaimed siddhartha in surprise . " an old man , " replied channa .
as before , the people received siddhartha with great enthusiasm .
but when he was returning to the palace he saw a sick man who was hardly able to walk .
" he is sick , " answered channa .
" old age , sickness , death ?
this gave siddhartha some hope .
siddhartha was then twenty - nine years old .
he woke up in the dead of night while his wife yashodhara was fast asleep , with one hand lying on rahula .
then he set forth in search of truth .
there he joined a famous school run by a great scholar udraka .
siddhartha went to a nearby river , niranjana , and bathed .
he was so weak , however , that he was almost carried away by the current .
the first step was for man to discipline himself .
without proper self - discipline it was impossible to lead a virtuous life .
the buddha considered compassion as the highest virtue .
he admired the decorum and dignity of their women , and their influence on social and domestic life .
they could discuss public issues and politics intelligently , and often exerted an influence on the thinking and actions of important public men .
their indirect influence on politics was by no means negligible .
apart from this , the presence of women at private and public gatherings gave grace and charm to these occasions .
there was no question but that men not only enjoyed their presence but tended to behave with more dignity when women were on the scene .
in india , especially among muslims , men and women lived in separate worlds .
it was not imagined that a woman could have any conceivable interest in what happened beyond the walls of her home .
the boy had no knowledge of his father and had been under the impression that he had no father other than shuddhodhana .
once , prasenajit was making preparations for a grand animal sacrifice .
vishakha invited the buddha to the house .
vishakha was convinced that once her father - in - law heard the buddha speak , he would be converted .
so she arranged things in such a way that migara heard the buddha when he spoke to the members of the family .
as expected , migara was so moved by the words of the compassionate buddha that he was converted .
vishakha never missed a sermon given by the master in shravasti .
the venerable monk ananda , a disciple of the buddha found the headpiece after everybody had left .
it became the favourite abode of the buddha ananthapindika was a rich merchant of shravasti .
but his brother - in - law said , " lord buddha is coming with his monks . "
he offered to build a monastery at shravasti for the monks ' retreat during the rainy season .
they . found a suitable place , not far from the city which was quiet for meditation and prayer .
at times to make his point clear he spoke in parables .
one such parable was the story of a king of varanasi .
the king of varanasi was a powerful monarch .
once seeing the weakness of the smaller neighbouring kingdom of kosala , he attacked it .
the king was worn out and fell asleep with his head on dighavu ' s lap .
eight years before the death of the buddha he started a rival organisation with a few personal friends and dependants .
he even succeeded in securing the support of five hundred monks of the sangha at rajagriha .
bimbisara was a loyal follower of the buddha .
as long as he lived devadatta knew that he would not be able to get the upper hand in magadha .
so he told ajatashatru , " your father is not very old .
do you think you have any hope of becoming king ? "
the stone rolled down with tremendous force , but on its way it hit a hard rock and broke into many pieces .
sariputra and moggallana were both important members of the sangha and were required for various administrative jobs .
if he accepted their services the sangha might suffer .
" the master is tired and is resting , " ananda said .
even on his death - bed the buddha did not refuse his guidance to the needy .
the buddha ' s condition deteriorated .
therefore strive to be good . "
as they work the men and the women sing , keeping the rhythm with the dhimmas .
thus it is evident that more often than not the beginning of music and musical instruments are to be found in tools and activities entirely unmusical .
for example , the conch shell ( sankh ) is a part of the musical ensemble , pancha vadya of kerala , karnataka , orissa and so on .
hindus use it in their worship as well , both as an auspicious sound and as acontainer of holy water or milk .
he was called to the bar in england in april 1867 , and soon afterwards he returned to india to start working .
but before that he gave himself the treat of walking and climbing in the most beautiful parts of england and switzerland .
but no one wants to know the views of an unknown painter about art , or of an ordinary school teacher about education .
in crushing the mutiny , the british also crushed , very deliberately and effectively , the self - respect of the entire indian people .
the attitude of the english people , which had so far been easy and friendly , changed into the haughtiness of a ruling race towards its subjects .
there was no longer the informal social intercourse which had characterised earlier relations .
young englishmen were encouraged , indeed instructed , to be rude and overbearing to the ' natives ' .
wherever contact was unavoidable , the indians were exposed to insults and snubs .
for instance , the english debarred all indians from their clubs and social entertainments .
they could , and often did , object to indians booking seats in the same railway carriage as themselves .
the first is , of course , the influx of certain instruments .
it has now come to stay as a major instrument in south india , and a few hindustani musicians have acquired a degree of competence in it .
a major new dimension introduced from the west is orchestration .
while all these are of great importance to harmonic music and of great beauty , they are alien to the indian musical genius .
as such this can be good indian music , but definitely not good raga music .
this brief survey of the cultural history of our instruments brings into focus the dynamic nature of all social processes .
clients first approach a solicitor when they need a lawyer , who puts them in touch with a suitable barrister .
in this way camruddin could always give work to his barrister brother and for badruddin this was a great help in establishing his practice .
badruddin discovered that all the gloomy warnings he had received from his friends about practising on the ' original side ' were correct .
he could not join their clubs or social institutions , and was , therefore , socially cut off from his colleagues .
indians were excluded from their social life ; in fact , from all close and informal contact .
the chimta seen in various parts of north india is a jingle johnny with small platelets .
) the instrument is shaken or beaten against the palm rhythmically in accompaniment to bhajans , folk songs and dances .
one cannot be very sure of the ' indian - ness ' of this instrument , as there is very little historical evidence .
the earthen pot is an instrument which is popular both in folk as well as classical music .
the folk varieties are made of clay or metal and go under names such as matki , gagri and noot .
while this is the usual term for drums , traditionally there is another , pushkara , which seems to have also meant drums in general .
bharata in his natya sastra tells a tale of how these pushkaras came into being .
according to the story , svati , a great saint , went to a pond ( pushkara ) in his hermitage for a wash .
the sage listened , to the sound enthralled and came back to his hut with the music still ringing in his ears .
he then had the various pushkaras such as the panava and the dardura made with the assistance of the heavenly craftsman , visvakarma .
further , due to the longer duration of their sounds , they are more musical than idiophones .
nevertheless , the duration is not long enough nor is the pitch definite or precise enough for avanaddha vadya to have become melodic instruments .
they have , hence , remained rhythmic instruments parexcellence .
another direction of evolution in this class of instruments is the potter ' s craft .
earthenware , even without the wheel , has a versatility in shape and an amenability for working , which is difficult to obtain in wood .
quite a few tribes have special ceremonies related to them .
almost every hindu applies alittle turmeric or kumkum ( vermillion ) to a new dhoti or saribefore first unfolding it for use .
vedic rituals also gave a prominent place to the drum , particularly the dundubhi .
12 pambai of all cylindrical drums none is so well known as the chenda of kerala .
this is an instrument seen invariably in kathakali , koodiyattam and related forms of dance .
the same instrument is known as the chende in certain areas of karnataka where it is an accompaniment in the yaksha gana dance - dramas .
while it is thus bifacial , in actual practice only one surface is beaten .
in old tamil literature also one comes across the murasu quite often .
these were not only martial in use , but were also employed in merrymaking and festivals .
and jain literature also has extensive references to certain bulging drums .
we have once again to fall back on the natya sastra for the earliest musical text describing the mridanga and allied drums .
the muraja seems to have had a shape similar to themridanga and the mardala , but with the heads ( beaten surfaces ) much smaller .
this is a very small drum , sometimes measuring as little as a few centimeters in length .
the body , which is waisted , is of wood and bears two parchments , one on each side and are held together by moderately thick cotton threads .
the damaru of tibet and its neighbouring areas is of great interest , both for their structure and for the occasions on which they are performed .
while the nga chung and the mchod nga used by wandering monks are common , there is also the fantastic thod nga .
while the naqara or nagara is used in folk dramas , marriage and religious processions , the traditional place where it is found is the naubatkhana .
this , as an institution , does not exist any more , and has gone with the disappearance of the princely states .
the ain - i - akbari then goes on to describe in detail seven kinds of music on different kinds of instruments .
18 tribal nagara smaller types of bowls are also very ubiquitous throughout the country the names and regional types are too many for a detailed description .
this method of loading is an age old practice in our country .
sometimes a mixture of what flour and barley flour is used .
the reader might have also noted in many rural areas people speaking with hollow and loosely closed fists in front of their mouths , as a mark of respect .
and we have all played with bottles , blowing across their mouths .
it is , therefore , not surprising that the pre - historic instruments found are whistles , bone trumpets and bone flutes .
he belonged to a family where men were fond of the good things of life which , for them , did not include either wine or women .
badruddin ' s home was that splendid mansion at breach candy which is now sophia college , and his grounds sprawled over seventeen acres .
he took an extraordinary interest and pride in his home , his garden , his horses , and his carriages .
it was a beautiful and dignified home , and a man who commanded such an establishment was not likely to be affected by social slights .
he worked hard and unremittingly his quickness of mind enabled him to achieve more during his long working hours than others .
his favourite drink was cold water , his favourite relaxation was going for walks and picnics .
he never went to the races , never gambled , drank , played cards for stakes , never went to ' nautch ' parties .
a further variation of this is the nagphani of gujarat .
the earliest straight trumpet was , in all likelihood , made of bone .
this does not seem to occur in india except in the himalayan regions , specially connected with buddhist tantra .
the bone trumpet there is called the khang ling and is made out of a femur .
the thigh bone of a woman seems to be preferred and the most valued one is the left bone of a sixteen year old brahmin girl .
apart from human femur the thigh bone of a tiger is also used and is known as the stag ling .
they have been found in neolithic excavations outside india and in prehistoric cave painting in our country .
it was made of gold , silver and copper of about half a meter in length .
today , naturally , a golden kahala is unthinkable , unless it is a curio kept in a temple or the old princely paraphernalia .
the common villager therefore uses a copper or brass kahala .
one interesting example is the thunchen of the northern hills of laddakh , tibet and bhutan .
this , as with all instruments here , is ceremonial and is played in ritual dances and music .
with us , the sankh or conch shell as a musical instrument is known in the entire subcontinent , from kanyakumari to the himalayas and from gujarat to meghalaya .
it always was a member of the panchamaha - sabha and now has a prominent place in the pancha vadya .
vedic references to the bakura which was a conch is another pointer to the antiquity of the shell trumpet .
when wars were declared or their victories were announced and when happy occasions were celebrated , the conch was sounded as it was considered an auspicious instrument .
for instance when bharata goes to nandigrama to meet lord rama , the sankh and the dundubhi accompanied the singers .
in the example already cited of the bharhut monkeys there is a long tube fixed to the sankh which almost forms and looks like the flare of a trumpet .
we will now turn to wind instruments that do use mechanical vibrators in some capacity or the other .
further , there is one very essential difference between the beating arid the free reeds .
the khung carries half a dozen sound tubes inserted into the gourd and these are arranged in groups , three in each set .
simple but extremely sweet tunes are thus played .
more sophisticated than these are the sheng of china , the sho of japan and the shaehghwang of korea .
the result is a weird tonal and rhythmic effect which can hold you for hours .
these instruments are used by snake charmers and balled singers .
a hempen rope is tied across these curved protrusions , and the instrument is ready .
whatever be the regional variety the bridge of the instrument is of a particular interest .
but the most important element is the small cotton , wool or silk thread inserted between the bridge and the strings .
in many cases musicological writing lacks the support of scientifically discussable material .
having linked these names with the word tamboora , it is natural that the evolution of the instrument is traced to times beyond known history .
it is probably that the lute got its name from the words tumbi or tumbi phala , referring to a pumpkin .
for our purpose it will be enough , to take note of two of the very major genuses of tata vadya .
because of the basic differences in structure and in the musical potentialities of each class , two fundamentally different tonal systems were developed in india .
on the other hand , instruments like the eka tantri , the sarode , the sitar , etc .
projecting out of this was the curved or straight wooden holder , the danda , onto which were tied the strings as described .
a possible reconstruction of the ancient harp is given here .
one of the most simple instruments of this class is the tuila of orissa .
even there it is fast disappearing and there are very few indeed who can play it .
over these passed a string of steel or brass and this was tensed by a peg on one side .
the vina resembles the yantra , but has three strings .
the kinnar resembles the vina , but with a longer fingerboard and had three gourds and two wires .
like the kinnari , the fingerboard is of a wide and smooth bamboo .
one end of this holds a flat bridge typical in our instruments and beneath the dandi are two very large pumpkins .
badruddin decided to go and have a discussion with lord ripon in calcutta .
" i took the responsibility upon myself and i telegraphed to stop all further agitation . "
the situation that no indian judge was ever allowed to try or sentence a european was now a thing of the past .
real equality was to come in time .
the agitation about the ilbert bill and its passage into law was notable for several reasons .
the ' agitation ' was no street demonstration .
within a few years of starting his law practice , badruddin found that he had more work than he could handle .
at the same time he had become deeply and strenuously involved in public and political work , so that he was under great strain .
his health and his eyesight broke down twice , and he was advised to stop work and go away for long rests .
at this time , about 1895 , the government asked badruddin to become a judge .
at the same time there were some disadvantages about which he had to ponder carefully .
for instance , once he became a judge of the high court , he would no longer be able to take part in many forms of political activities .
he would not , in other words , be able to play a very active part in the indian national congress , as he had done in the past .
perhaps in other circumstances these considerations might have outweighed the advantage of accepting the judgeship .
but his eyesight was now so bad that it was uncertain whether he could carry on his legal work .
as a judge , his eyes would be saved of much strain , and this consideration probably made him take the decision to accept .
his critics , and even his friends , felt that he could do far more important work as a private citizen than he could as a judge .
he had recently filled in his term as president of the indian national congress .
and there was little doubt that , for the time and the circumstances , he was an ideal leader .
that the same uncertainties were present in badruddin ' s mind is proved by a piece of paper found among his things after his death .
listed in one column are all the activities which would become closed to him , mainly politics .
another column lists the advantages the main one being that he would preserve his eyesight .
badruddin was at home with many indian languages and familiar with the majority of the cultures whose representatives were likely to appear before him in the court .
few people realised that someone who did not know a man ' s cultural background was not always capable of being truly just to him .
he was interested , literally , in the facts of the case , in finding out what really and actually happened .
his was an unusual gift , the gift of brilliant common sense .
well , having made his money , how did tyab ali proceed to spend it ?
obviously , he did not despise a high style of living , or he could not have earned the epithet of ' prince ' .
but much of his money was spent or perhaps invested in a better word in buying education for his six sons .
he had picked up his own education not merely from books , but also , and especially , from the world around him .
the reason his judgement caused a tremendous sensation was because , although it was so obviously right , it was also so unexpected .
in 1902 , badruddin was appointed acting chief justice of bombay , an honour which had never before been offered to an indian .
a few days before he was due to sail for home , however , he died suddenly in his london home , in the midst of apparently normal health .
he was sixty - two - years old .
not to spend money on the poorer quarters was unfair , and this could only be remedied if each locality had an elected representative .
throughout his life badruddin had great faith in the principle of election , and this was his first public speech in defence of election as against selection or nomination .
it has been said that democracy is a very unsatisfactory system of government , but the other systems are even worse .
only property - holders and people with certain educational qualifications had the right to vote .
but whether it is selective or universal suffrage , democracy still remains ' the least unsatisfactory of all the many forms of government ' .
it was for the first time that badruddin , phirozeshah mehta and kashinath brimbak telang were together taking part in a debate on public affairs .
he very quickly saw that his own community , much as he was attached to it was narrow , orthodox and in a broad sense , not really educated .
unfortunately , at that time even those hindus who were his friends were unwilling to break bread in the house of someone who was of another caste or community .
there was a clear distinction in his mind between true religious convictions and the irrelevant accretions which had collected around them .
islam is , after all , a very simple , straightforward religion .
anyone can become a muslim by announcing that there is only one god , and that mohammed is his prophet .
he made it his business to meet badruddin soon after coming to india .
soon afterwards , he was given a knighthood by the british government .
a series of unfortunate coincidences also helped this ' divide and rule ' policy .
accordingly w . c . bannerji of calcutta was chosen .
and yet , no man should be blamed for putting friendship above other considerations .
he went on to say that it had been alleged that the congress consisted only of ' educated natives ' , and was therefore unimportant .
gentlemen , i for one , am proud to be called not only educated but a ' native of this country ' . "
above all , badruddin was anxious to emphasise the point that muslims whole - heartedly supported the aims of the congress , and were one with it .
for a people who did not have much mental occupation , the demands made by namaz five times a day was a wonderful way of concentrating the mind .
and for a people noticeably lacking in self - control , the long month of fasting was a lesson in discipline and the exercise of will power .
without being a fanatic , badruddin understood the true importance of islamic rules , and he kept to them meticulously , both in the letter and the spirit .
at the same time , he believed that many of the outward habits of muslims at that time were not a necessary part of the faith .
if he himself dressed in long robes and kept a beard , this was a sign of personal preference rather than a part of his religion .
perhaps it is not quite right to say that tyab ali ' s domestic habits did not change with his changing mental vision .
in one important aspect he changed the habits of his home .
during his childhood , his mother tongue had been , naturally , gujarati .
they both admired certain things about the englishman , while they both refused to be brow - beaten by him .
you can imagine how limited and undeveloped their minds were .
no wonder so few muslim families were really educated in the modern sense .
in his father ' s household , his sisters were all well educated , according to the standards of their time .
his daughters studied arabic , persian , urdu , and gujarati at home while they were young , after which they were sent to english - medium schools .
his daughters were all given music lessons , and were set to entertaining their father by singing ghazals for him in the evenings .
i do not think that badruddin would have been a great supporter of women ' s lib as it has emerged in the last decade .
however advanced his views , he saw the role of women as makers of homes and raisers of families .
he trusted their intuition and their understanding of human feelings .
it is well known that islam gave several important rights and safeguards to women .
one is the right of inheritance a daughter is entitled to half the amount of the son ' s share in the father ' s property .
while women were uneducated and helpless , this law was often neglected among many muslim sects .
the father ' s property was shared out between the sons , the daughters were either given nothing , or a small amount .
badruddin was meticulous in insisting that all daughters must be given their rightful share in their father ' s property .
his correspondence with sir syed had convinced him that it was not possible to have a rational , reasoned argument with him .
accordingly , rather than attempt to continue a dialogue , badruddin preferred to withdraw from the politics of north indian muslims .
he could always carry with him the opinions of the majority in the anjuman - i - islam .
sir syed had founded the mohammedan anglo - oriental educational conference , a body which he used for propagating his opinions .
although its ostensible aim was to encourage education among the muslims , the conference was used as a platform for anti - congress propaganda .
it had been the main factor in preventing the muslims of north india from joining the congress as badruddin wished them to do .
this time , instead of refusing outright , badruddin made certain conditions .
the president , nawab mohsin - ul - mulk , agreed to this for no price was too high for the privilege of having badruddin associated with the conference .
it would raise its prestige tremendously , and give it an all - india character which it could never achieve as long as badruddin kept away from it .
on his side , badruddin saw this as an opportunity to address and influence all the muslims of india .
their present habit of considering that a knowledge of urdu and arabic was sufficient knowledge for any man , had the result of depriving them of gainful employment .
badruddin believed that all girls , too , should be educated in the modern sense .
he put his beliefs into practice when he sent his own daughters to missionary schools after they had been taught urdu and the quran at home .
gentlemen , you are probably aware of my peculiar position in reference to the indian national congress .
on that occasion , i described my election as the highest honour that could be paid to any indian by his fellow subjects of the empire .
having said this , he explained once more to this wholly muslim gathering the principles on which their political attitudes should be based .
this principle , worded with so much clarity , seems to me to be a fine and viable rule for muslims to follow even today .
western nations were leading the world , and it was most important that we too should have an acquaintance with modern knowledge and acquire scientific attitudes .
without this we would be left behind , we would became poorer and poorer as a community , and complete losers in the race for progress .
the second point , which was very close to badruddin ' s heart , was perhaps even more important .
the purdah system , as it was practised during that time , was so constricting as to be unbelievable .
the words of the quran and hadees ( sayings of the prophet ) were simply very general recommendations for personal modesty and dignity .
over the years , and in the various cultures which were influenced by islam , these recommendations were interpreted in various concrete ways .
the position , then , was that personally badruddin had already made adjustments in his own household .
the reactions to badruddin ' s speech can be imagined .
so far , no muslim had dared to openly challenge the established practices of the community .
the mullahs and maulvis had always had the last word in deciding the correct forms of all religious practices .
obviously purdah would not disappear in a day it would take many years , and it would take even longer for its indirect ill - effects to disappear .
this struggle was the result of a clash of interests between those of the indian people and those of the british rulers .
neither the british government nor the east india company possessed such large financial resources .
gradually it became necessary , to expand its territories in india in order to be able to levy more taxes over larger areas and increase their financial resources .
india was reputed to be rich and was , therefore , seen as capable of playing an important role in this respect .
it appropriated large parts of this wealth and state revenues entirely for its own benefit and for that of its employees and for financing its further expansion in india .
the wealth drained out of india played an important part in financing britain ' s capitalist development .
it has been estimated that it constituted nearly two per cent of britain ' s national income at the time .
at the same time the company used its political power to acquire monopolistic control over indian trade and production .
she also had to export a good deal of wealth to pay dividends to the company ' s shareholders and pensions for british civil and military officials .
for all this it was necessary that india must export some products to britain and other countries .
above all , free trade was introduced and india ' s ports and markets were thrown wide open to british manufactures .
it is not surprising that he does not seem to have had a childhood .
technically , the business of sailing for england in 1860 , when badruddin first left india , was easier than it is now .
there were no passports , visas , inoculations , health checks , foreign exchange rules ; you just bought a ticket and climbed on to a ship .
emotionally and psychologically , however , it was much more difficult than it is now .
english ways and customs , even the english language , was as yet strange and unknown to most indians .
" what danger is going to befall my son ? " he asked anxiously .
" i am not crying for the child , " replied asita , " but for myself .
this child will one day bring deliverance to the world .
seven days after the baby ' s birth , mahamaya died .
" he will conquer the world , " said one learned pandit .
" only if he stays at home , " added another .
all three palaces were surrounded with flower gardens and lotus pools .
he never wore anything except silk and never went out in the heat , , cold or rain .
the force of the argument impressed the king .
shuddhodhana took every precaution not to expose his son to the sight of human suffering of any kind .
" but he shall receive no greeting from us , " they all said .
this is the dhamma , the law of righteousness .
the sermon at sarnath was only the beginning .
for the rest of his life the buddha travelled the country taking his message of righteousness to the people .
the buddha ' s teachings were very simple and could be easily understood .
buddhist monks spent their retreats in the viharas .
it was during this visit to rajagriha that the buddha converted sanputra and moggallana .
they had been friends from childhood and had renounced the world in search of the truth .
one day , sariputra in his wanderings came across assa - ji , one of the first five disciples of the master .
he asked , " who is your teacher , brother ?
whose dhamma do you follow ? "
" i follow the sage of the sakyas , " answered assaji .
kaludayin went ahead to inform shuddhodhana about the visit .
you have found the path to save all mankind . "
the next morning the buddha , as customary among monks , took his bowl and set out to beg .
the word gatra veena may make us wonder at the usage of the word veena , because we usually associate it with stringed instruments of the plucked variety .
however , it seems to have meant any instrument , including the voice , capable of producing melody .
similar confusion exists in mardal or madal which is a two - faced drum from the tribal areas of madhya pradesh .
but maddalam or maddale in the southern parts of our country is very different in shape and structure , though it is also a bifacial drum .
these questions of nomenclature may seem pedantic to the lay student of music , but become extremely important to the specialist historian .
it is necessary , therefore , to be on one ' s guard whenstudying the past story of our instruments .
muraja , tamil murasu ) , vangsi ( skt .
a portable version of the ' slit drum ' is known in some parts of the country .
the longer side is open as a narrow slit through which , of course , the scooping out of the inside could be done .
the idiophone is suspended from the neck of the player who uses sticks to beat the instrument .
at this end , the sides of the tube are carved out to make a handle .
for instance , in parts of mysore a smaller variety is employed by elephant hunters .
this diminutive instrument seven to eight centimeters in length is a folk instrument found in places such as rajasthan and the brij districts of uttar pradesh .
but in the south it is very frequently used in concert music as a kind of rhythmic auxiliary to the mridanga , ghata and the khanjeera .
the main frame has an annular base which does not complete the circle .
the player holds the moorchang with the palm of one hand and prongs are held firmly between the teeth .
the tongue or lamella is now plucked with the fingers of the other hand .
3 moorchang the kirikittaka or its varieties is one of the most primitive instruments we have .
15 hudukka tudi is a small hourglass drum played with song and dance in the villages of karnataka and kerala .
when in a village a theft had taken place and the culprit was not traceable it was customary to depend on the services of a tudi player .
he would take his place in the village square with the entire population round him .
in either case he got caught .
a reference to the cotton braces connecting the two drum - faces was made while describing the budbudke .
" so am i , " said badruddin politely and left immediately in spite of the flustered judge ' s attempts to stop him .
the paper represents you to have made a ' rigmarole and nonsensical speech ' in defence of your client .
16 idakka we may now turn our attention to avanaddha vadya derivable from pots , pans , troughs and such other vessels .
the variety of shapes and sizes also developed pari passu the potter ' s craft , as will become evident from what follows .
the simplest is naturally an earthen pot the mouthof which is bound with a leather covering .
each of these is a large clay pot with a membranestretched over a wide mouth .
the temple at pattadakalluin karnataka , dated from the 5th to 7th century is perhaps the earliest site where such a pot drum is shown .
there is another temple , also in karnataka where there is a relief showing not one drum but three pots tied together and played with the hands .
very much like the ghumat are the gummate of karnataka , the buna of andhra and the jamukku of tamil nadu , but they are better made .
as for instruments like the oboe , the shehnai and the nagasvaram , they must have been very recent indeed .
the flute , according to a distinguished scholar , was the invention of the savara people living in the hill forests of andhra and orissa .
the man climbed up a high tree and threw the fruit down , and the woman put them into her net .
suddenly a big piece of fruit fell onto a dry bamboo tree and cracked it open with a sharp sound .
the man at once built a fence round the bird , ran into the village and told his friends what had happened .
in all trumpets , horns and conches , the moving lips of the player act as valves regulating the air as it enters the tube .
in our country , horns are ancient but can still be found now in tribal and folk music .
the word used is shringa or its modifications in indo - aryan languages and kombu or its variants in the dravidian ; both mean horn .
the santals have the sakna which again is buffalo horn .
there is a telugu folk story , katamaraju katha , which has an episode of nallasiddhi going to battle .
on the sanskritic and related side many evidences are available .
mahabharata has the govishanika which was quite probably a cow ' s horn .
krishna is even called srnga priya in the bhagavata and there is an incident where he wakes up his cowherd friend to the sound of the srnga .
music texts , of course , include the srnga as one of the sushira vadyas as can be seen from the sangeeta makaranda onwards .
the bowstring is a hemp or leather strap .
this villu is kept on an inverted earthen pot which serves as a ( detachable ) sound amplifier .
the villadi vadyam is an accompaniment to certain kinds of ballads known as the villu pattu .
there is also a chorus which keeps him company in song and rhythm , giving time with clappers , cymbals and the udukkai .
badruddin had a naturally impatient temper , but in his work he trained himself to be patient and calm .
here is the story .
in an assured manner , badruddin replied , ' i hope so , sir ! '
so you are a christian ? '
the father of badruddin tyabji was a very remarkable man called tyab ali .
he started his own little business by selling the yarn his mother used to spin , and in a short time he progressed to selling pencils and slates .
we have now got used to such wild acts , but in those days it was almost unimaginable .
gentlemen , i venture to think that the present state of the law is not only unjust , but it is insulting to us .
it is insulting to us , because it draws an invidious distinction between the european and the ' native ' members of the same covenanted service .
and , warning the government of the dangers of giving up this bill because of the agitation against it by the europeans , he said :
this speech is worth reading several times and analysing carefully .
he founded the indian national congress , associating badruddin with it from its inception .
albert octavins hume was a most extraordinary englishman whose life deserves to be studied .
among his many interests was an interest in bird life , and naturalists in india look upon him as the father of indian ornithology .
badruddin tyabji was , from the beginning , a wholehearted supporter of the indian national congress .
his own idealism matched the purpose and aims of the new body .
sir syed was influential in north india , and because of him badruddin did not succeed in persuading muslims to join the congress in large numbers .
it suited the british government to keep hindus and muslims apart , and in sir syed they found a useful helper .
when lord ripon retired , his place was taken by lord dufferin who was an entirely different kind of man .
as far as the resolutions were concerned , badruddin was convinced about the importance of their being passed unanimously .
in one case where the delegates were divided in their opinions , and there was danger of some disorder , he asked for time .
in a few minutes , he managed to reframe the resolution in such a way that it was passed without any reservations .
in presiding over the third session of the indian national congress , badruddin ' s great effort had been to strengthen the infant congress in every way .
it was just after the madras congress , that the clever ' divide and rule ' policy of the british government bore its first ugly fruit .
after the end of the madras session , badruddin considered that one of his main tasks was to try to persuade muslims to join the congress in large numbers .
in a religion which stresses the brotherhood of man , there were innumerable factions all opposed to each other .
in his own house he made it a point to invite people of all communities and sects together .
it was a strange fact that though badruddin was personally not a gregarious , or even a sociable man , he had great faith in social intercourse .
one was the islam club at chowpatty where muslims of all sects congregated and got to know each other .
the other institution was the islam gymkhana , whose playing fields and clubhouse occupy the beautiful site on marine drive .
there is no doubt that this mingling and socialising changed the atmosphere in the fragmented world of bombay muslims .
badruddin was a great believer in physical fitness and he knew that the only way to physical fitness was through exercise and sport .
badruddin himself had to learn all these languages before his english education began .
badruddin set about forming a plan to help his community to break out of this cultural prison .
this seemed , at that time , a wildly ambitious wish .
but , difficult as it seemed , there was really no formal or legal obstruction .
the difficulties , or rather disabilities , under which indians lived in those days were the difficulties of circumstances .
there was no law to say that an indian was forbidden to be a barrister .
but what was this ' tryst with destiny ' nehru was speaking about ?
ever since then each year this day is celebrated as republic day .
it was to the events of 1929 - 30 that nehru was referring when he spoke about our ' tryst with destiny ' .
the pledge that was taken on that day was redeemed on 15 august 1947 when india became free .
but india ' s fight for freedom did not begin in 1929 .
consequently , they supported british rule and even described it as ' providential ' .
indians , they said , were ' unfit ' for self - government or democracy .
freedom of the press which had so attracted the indian intelligentsia soon began to be tampered with .
even elementary civil rights , the freedoms of thought , speech and association were increasingly violated and restricted .
in the cultural field the indian intellectuals noted that the progressive impulse had withered rather quickly .
consequently , the modern indian intellectuals began the hard task of examining and understanding afresh the basic character of british rule .
their understanding took time to develop .
the government also began to extend patronage to the traditional intelligentsia through pensions / financial rewards and bestowal of titles and honours .
the british in india had always kept their distance from indians and felt themselves to be racially superior .
he is said to have been an extremely good - looking young man .
he ' stood tall ' , and therefore seemed tall , although in fact he was of average height .
they would become at home , not only in the english - speaking world , but in the whole of the western hemisphere .
he wanted them to acquire the breadth of mind , the enlarged vision , the tolerance and understanding which is inevitably the result of close contact with another culture .
it became one of the favourite retreats of the master and many of his discourses were given there .
king prasenajit accompanied by his nobles came here several times to pay homage to the teacher of righteousness .
on his kingly duties the buddha said , " regard your people as men do an only son .
once the teacher was staying there with his favourite disciple ananda .
as was his practice , ananda got up early , and , taking his bowl , went into the city to beg for alms .
there he saw an outcaste chandala girl drawing water .
" give me some water , sister , i wish to drink , " requested ananda .
under these circumstances it is not surprising that most women were in fact , not intelligent enough , or not informed enough to be worth talking to .
one consequence of this kind of segregation was that there was usually little mental companionship between husband and wife .
however affectionate or tender the relationship , there was seldom any intellectual give - and - take .
he explained his problems to her , and discussed their solution .
in england , badruddin also learnt to admire and emulate the englishman ' s interest in games and sports , and his concern for physical fitness .
surprising as this attitude was , badruddin admired it and made it his own throughout his life .
this was the chance dighavu had been waiting for .
he drew his sword out of its sheath and said , " you killed my father and mother .
but suddenly the words of his father came to his mind .
for the best results the strings must be stretched with precise moderation .
out of spite he once killed a white elephant which the young prince was specially fond of .
the buddha was the undisputed leader of the sangha , and devadatta grew envious of him .
" i shall lead the sangha as long as i live , " replied the buddha .
when he came to know that the buddha was on his way there to spend the rainy season in his monastery , he conspired to kill him .
furthermore they were themselves quite old .
the buddha spent his last retreat near vaishali , the capital of the licchavi republic .
she invited the sage and his monks for dinner to her house .
" we have been rejected in preference to a mere dancing girl , " the nobles complained .
great and small were equal in his eyes .
" the master is tired and is resting , " ananda said .
even on his death - bed the buddha did not refuse his guidance to the needy .
therefore strive to be good . "
the violin bow might well have grown out of the act of fire - making by scraping one rod over another .
perhaps , the reader has heard the music of the nagas of the eastern provinces of india or of the todas of nilgiris in tamil nadu .
and , if you compare these sounds with the high intricacy of raga and tala , they may not sound musical .
what is true of music in general is more evident with instruments .
the problem , then , is not easy and many schemes have been tried both in our country and outside .
later writers also tried their hands at grouping instruments .
for example , an author gives three types : tata ( strings ) , vitata ( drums ) and tata - vitata .
another thought of three kinds : charma ( leather ) , tantrika ( string ) and ghana ( solid ) .
kohala , before the 6th century a . d . , has ghana , sushira , charmabaddha ( bound with leather ) and tantri .
notice the inclusion of the voice also in the family of instruments , which reminds us of the gatra veena of sanskrit texts .
all those mentioned so far are just plain surfaces .
but the seemu found in the north - eastern provinces is a large gong with a small boss ( a convex bulge ) at the centre .
the plates being of varying thickness and diameters , they give out tones of the different pitches in a musical scale .
one could even call it a thali tarang , analogous to kashta tuning , nal tarang and so on .
( 8 ) it does not require much imagination to see that by imitating these natural buds in metal we get bells .
some of the english barristers openly resented badruddin ' s presence and it was not easy for him to get work .
taken in a broad sense , the realm of the law was boundless , and ceased only where human activity ceased .
it is of course very questionable whether there was a physical sacrifice of human beings .
the prevalence of human sacrifice during vedic times seems to be doutbtful .
some kind of worship of the drum has continued to much later times .
the offering should be decorated with flowers of dhustura ( datura ) and karaveera ( oleander ) along with a red cloth .
to the hindu mind the damaru has inextricably esoteric associations with the cosmic dancer , siva .
this band is tied round the forehead of the player who strikes the instrument on both sides of the membrane with small sticks .
forexample , in the chengu of orissa the skin is just crudelynailed to the frame by means of wooden pins .
usually , however , the leather passesuniformly over the wooden strip and is nailed to it bysmall metal nails placed closely at regular intervals .
theinstrument is commonly suspended from the neck , heldvertically and beaten with the hands or small straightsticks .
in maharashtra andkarnataka it is also known as the halige .
drum was pataha , a word found in the mahabharata and the natya sastra .
however , medieval writers on music used the word most probably to mean a barrel drum .
other names for this class of instruments are dayara , chang , karachakra and so on .
the relief of a large medallion shows a procession of monkeys and an elephant .
in all there are eight monkeys , five of them riding on an elephant , perched all over the animal ' s back .
" what is called eloquence , " badruddin once wrote , " is entirely out of place in the high court . "
although he had to work closely with englishmen , badruddin made no effort to look like them .
once , an english judge could not hear him properly in court , and asked him , a little sharply , to speak louder .
badruddin did not consider the request courteous enough , and he continued to mumble .
a generation ago even the dholak was played , though not frequently , in serious music ; but one never comes across this in classical music now .
another instrument is the suddha maddalam which resembles the mridangam but is played with dances such as the kathakali .
the body or shell of the instrument is of wood and about sixty centimeters in length .
the left face , called the toppi , is simpler having two lamina .
tuning of the drum is done by striking the right pinnal with a wooden block and a stone .
( 13 ) the pakhavaj is the king of drums in hindustani music , though today it is more a constitutional monarch , respected from a distance .
times have changed today , for khyal singing and the sitar hold court ; and so the tabla with its soft sound has taken over .
the pakhavaj , as pakhavaj , gets an early reference most probably in the hindi literature of about five hundred years ago .
the tavil , like the other drums described , is also of wood though shorter in length , with the membranes almost of the same size .
the parchments are fixed to rings - one for each side - and these are held together by leather lacing .
the player beats on one side with a stick and on the other side with his fingers .
it is usual to call the larger drums as dhole or dhak and the smaller ones as dholak .
the sizes may vary from the huge dhaks of bengal to the small dholaks of itinerant beggars and drums beaten by ladies in marriages .
the shapes also differ from the almost cylindrical to the barrel .
the manner of stretching the hide over the mouths and lacing also varies .
the drum face may be plain or may be loaded from the inside with the pulp of , say , castor seeds after the extraction of oil .
14 tribal dhole the third class of bifacial avanaddha vadya are the waisted ones , also called the hourglass , sandglass or the damaru shaped drums .
this form has an ancient past and once was a major instrument in sophisticated music .
today , however , one hears them only in tribal and folk music not on the concert platform .
right from mohenjodaro we can trace the hourglass drum ' s occurrence and every age has depicted it in sculpture , in icons and in painting .
the panava is as old as the sootra literature and the epics , the ramayana and the mahabharata .
tamil classics have the utukkai , itakkai , timilai and so on which can be seen in use even now .
another drum belonging to this class is the auz which word , according to some , is derived from the sanskrit atodya meaning instruments in general .
but in punjab , rajasthan , maharashtra and some other areas there is another instrument , the algoza .
the two flutes are placed together inside the mouth and blown into at the same time .
but it is usual to use one of the instruments for the melody and the other to give the drone or base note .
24 bansuri ; beak flute the horizontal flute is the best known and most popular throughout the country .
indian music at its refined excellence is rich in fine pitch differences and ornamentations ; the former are the srutis and the latter the gamakas .
now these are best obtained by the complicated fingering techniques , adjustments of the pressure of blowing and slight changes in the angles of the flute on the lip .
the flute now being described , the horizontal or cross flute , is closed at one end and open at the other .
a few centimeters from the blocked end there is a hole known as the embouchure or blow hole into which the flutist blows .
( 26 ) a very near cousin of the pungi is the tarpo , also called the ghonga , the khongada or the dobru , depending on the size .
the principle of construction is exactly the same as in pungi .
in place of the small bottle gourd in the pungi is the long gourd , called doodiya bhopla in maratni .
this has a hole at the side instead of one at the tips , and the opening is also fitted with a mouthpiece .
the air blown through this is stored in the hollow of the dried pumpkin , it accumulates pressure and then flows out through two bamboo or reed pipes .
they also have holes outside which are visible for playing the music .
there is one accessory not found in the mahudi : this is funnel for amplifying and directing the sound .
the air chamber in this instrument is not dried fruit but a full goat skin bag , legs and all .
the mashak when properly sealed and filled with air , becomes an efficient float with which to cross rivers .
31 khung or rusem thousand years before the commencement of the christian era and pictorial representations of it from the sixth century after christ .
the reed organ then came to india with the western invaders , traders and proselytizers and has taken the form of the indian harmonium .
the harmonium comprises four working parts : the bellows , the air chamber , the keys and the reeds .
the bellows have holes to let in air from the atmosphere and also leather valves to prevent it from going out .
there are various theories about this but none entirely comprehensive nor completely accepted .
the hunting bow is an ancient and familiar tool and many harps are believed to have really evolved out of this .
in pleading for the defence , badruddin took the view that the same facts were capable of a quite different interpretation .
he opened his case by carefully repeating the evidence , point by point .
on the other hand , if a man is not telling the truth , his answers will make a haphazard pattern , contradictory , illogical , and obviously unreliable .
we all know , by experience , how difficult it is to defend a small lie even without any intensive questioning .
like the chitra , the vipanchi also finds a place in the epics .
one very important fact we cannot help noticing is that in india none of these veenas had any pegs .
the gut or metal string passing out of the resonator was tied to a leather strap which in its turn was wound round the string holder .
the leather winding was moved slightly up or down this holder to alter the tension and hence the pitch of the string .
it was an instrument of the aristocracy , played in their mansions and seraglios .
tamil writers themselves have called it as a avanakkai veenai , meaning an instrument of the yavanas who are usually taken to be greeks .
however , it is quite possible that it might have reference , as it often did in other parts of india , to any ' foreigner ' .
plato even condemned them as enthusing hedone - that is sensory pleasure .
the strings are stretched on a wooden chest which acts both as a rest for them as well as a resonator .
it may be remembered that the vana had a hundred strings ( of spun grass ) and was probably played with sticks .
etymology apart , the modern santoor does have a large number of strings and is struck with sticks .
a set of four strings of metal tuned to the same note is stretched over each pair of bridges ; thus the total number of wires is sixty .
it had one string ( in some varieties three ) of animalsinew , cotton or silk .
the danda of the veena was approximately one hundred and forty centimeters in length and it had a gourd below the danda .
there are a few aspects that draw our attention here .
and the kind of ascetic lives they lead is said to follow in the foot - path of this prince during his emeretic period .
the kinnari must have been quite popular , for not only is it described in some detail in many books but was also widely illustrated in medieval sculpture .
the earliest assignable period for the kinnari could be about the fifth ( ?
) century a . d . when one matanga lived and wrote a book on music , called the brhaddesi .
as their names indicate the first one was small ( laghu ) and second was ~ a larger ( brhat ) variety .
the laghu kinnari used in classical music had a fingerboard of bamboo nearly seventy - five centimeters long , with two pumpkins .
this sudden turn and onslaught was so unexpected that the salvationist fled in disorder . "
if anyone had ' an eye for a lie , and a tooth for the truth ' , it was badruddin tyabji , the judge .
the kind of subtle discrimination which you need ' to arrive at the truth ' , in a courtroom was badruddin ' s peculiar gift .
tichborne and his hundreds of false witnesses were not indians .
for the next ten years badruddin served his city on the town council , the forerunner of the bombay municipal corporation .
the foundations of good management were laid at this time .
and , for the next fifty years , bombay was an extraordinarily beautiful and pleasant place .
from serving his city , the natural next step was to serve the state , or the bombay presidency , as it was called in those days .
badruddin took the hint , and resigned from the municipality .
so far the british had never made any effort to associate indians in the business of governing their own country .
laws were framed in an arbitrary manner , with no explanation of their reason nor of the results they were meant to achieve .
he was anxious that people should have the chance to know about , and discuss , all legislation before it became law .
this , then , was the aim of the legislative council to which badruddin was nominated as a member by the governor of bombay .
as we said earlier badruddin always had a great deal of faith in an electoral system , especially where the voters were persons of some education .
this was a strong speech for a young man , the only indian in the council , to address to the governor and his advisors .
but the governor was fair enough to accept the criticism .
badruddin was a member of this committee , and he worked on it very hard .
the other committee members were english , and badruddin by no means always won his point .
there were two changes which he succeeded in introducing which are particularly interesting for us .
" the more intelligent the electors , the more chances there will be of the experiment becoming a success . "
i believe . . . the favour recently shown him by the viceroy . . . has completely turned his head . . . "
this failure was the most bitter defeat of his life .
he believed whole - heartedly in the teachings of islam , he was punctilious about religious duties like namaz and fasting , and he never touched wine .
this pledge he kept throughout his life .
the prohibition against wine and pork was , obviously , in the interest of better mental and physical health in the hot climate of the arabian desert .
badruddin stressed , over and over again , that religious heads should not dabble in worldly matters if they did not know enough about them .
there were , however , two sides to being a good muslim .
on the one hand there was one ' s private life as a muslim , on the other was one ' s public duties and responsibilities to the community .
obviously one ' s sense of responsibility increases in proportion to the poverty and helplessness of one ' s own community .
the founding of the islam gymkhana was the answer to this problem ; and i think it must have served its purpose very well .
and badruddin realised that the most important thing for the muslims of india , whether of the north or south , was a practical scheme of good education .
in 1882 lord ripon appointed an education commission and badruddin seized the chance to appear before it to do some special pleading on behalf of the muslims .
the government had been planning to reduce its subsidy on education .
on the contrary , he said , education deserved far greater support and encouragement from the government than it had so far been getting .
an annual grant was gladly given to the anjuman school , although it was not big enough .
when , finally , the new school building was opened by the then governor of bombay , lord reay , he said :
sir syed managed to arouse passions , he could frighten them , cajole them , excite them .
eloquent speaker though he was , badruddin could not do this .
and naturally badruddin ' s was a losing battle .
between the british government and their man syed ahmed khan , the muslims were incapable of taking the harder road , and badruddin had to admit defeat .
but this defeat only proved once again , if proof were still necessary , of the importance of modern education among the muslims .

the signs the dangers what to do
what is solvent sniffing ?
aerosol sprays ( virtually any aerosol may be used ; hair sprays and pain - relieving sprays are common ) ;
solvent - based glues ( such as evo - stik ) ;
correcting fluids ( such as tipp - ex ) ;
dry - cleaning fluids ;
the contents of some types of fire extinguishers ;
petrol ;
in the average home there are over thirty sniffable products .
some youngsters who sniff have accidents while they are intoxicated and some further damage to their health .
how many young people sniff ?
but a few many become heavy and frequent solvent misusers .
some people say there is more sniffing in the summer , but perhaps it ' s just more obvious in the long summer evenings .
most young people will never try sniffing .
young people have their own reasons for misusing solvents .
david added : ' yeah , when we ' re on it we have a great laugh like , '
here are some other reasons why young people sniff .
solvents can be an alternative to alcohol .
some young people like the excitement of sniffing solvents , perhaps partly because the element of danger .
if adults are shocked by sniffing , that can be an attraction .
for some young people there is an attraction of playing with a new physical sensation .
adults can help by getting misusers to see that solvents wo n ' t solve their problems .
until they accept this they are not likely to stop .
sometimes , sniffing may be a reaction to problems in the family .
for instance , kathy ( aged 14 ) started sniffing and although she was a very bright girl , she could n ' t explain why .
her father wanted her to go to cambridge university and get a good degree but she wanted to become a photographer .
it was also an escape from the pressure he was putting on her .
can you recognise a sniffer ?
education in schools , colleges and youth projects to try and prevent young people from sniffing may help to reduce casualties .
many schools have education about drugs and solvents built in to the curriculum .
but the educational message must be the right one .
education is not just about giving people the facts .
we know that does n ' t work very well - it has n ' t stopped people smoking .
instead , teachers , parents and other adults who come into contact with young people need to :
help them to have new and exciting experiences without using chemicals ;
teach them to care for and value their health ;
monitor current prescriptions to make sure that children are not using them for their first experiments with drugs .
how can we help solvents misusers ?
but if you discover that a child has tried solvents , what can you do ?
more important than talking , you will need to listen .
perhaps there are problems that you do n ' t know about .
you may find that sniffing is n ' t the main problem , and it ' s more urgent to tackle other problems .
if they have been sniffing for some time , arrange a health check .
you may want to ensure that they do n ' t carry on sniffing .
but it may be difficult to stop a determined sniffer .
it will also help you to keep track of how they are using their free time .
you might think about your own use of drugs like alcohol and tobacco .
you may want to get advice from a local helping agency .
there are some addresses in this booklet to put you in touch with the right people .
exertion after sniffing might cause heart failure .
parents sometimes need more help in getting young people to make the difficult change from childhood to adulthood .
there are agencies and groups who can help with the problems young people and their parents have .
these are listed at the back of this booklet .
what happened to sally ?
sally was 13 and doing ok at school .
when it was sally ' s turn she took a large breath .
she became frightened by the effects .
she ran up the stairs to go to the toilet to be sick but collapsed on the landing .
sally arrived home late in the evening looking very pale and exhausted .
her mother is now worried about this and concerned that sally will escalate her drinking .
they also negotiate with her a ' coming home time ' if she is going to be out later than usual .
then , he started getting interested in banger - racing and got a steady girlfriend .
gradually he sniffed less and less , and his health improved .
what else can you read ?
if you want to find out more about drugs and solvents you can read :
publications from re - solv , the society for the prevention of solvent and volatile substance abuse .
if you want more information to help you as a parent , you could read :
leaflet on ' adolescents and drugs ' and ' adolescents and alcohol ' published by the organisation , exploring paranthood at 50p each ;
' living with teenagers ' by martin herbert ( basil blackwemm 1987 ) ;
where can you get help and advice ?
after reading this booklet you may feel that you need more information or some extra help .
they publish leaflets , booklets and videos and know about local agencies who can help .
contact them at 30a high street , stone , staffs , st15 8aw . telephone : 0785 - 817885 .
exploring parenthood is an organisation which offers help and advice to parents .
the national children ' s bureau has an information project on solvent sniffing for professionals who work with young people .
their books , ' soluble problems ' and ' sniffing solutions ' , cover practical responses to solvent sniffing .
a reading list is available .
they are at 8 wakley street , london , ec1v 7qe . telephone : 071 - 278 - 9441 .

all types of fresh fruit
sandwiches ( with savoury fillings )
savoury crackers / oatcakes
low fat plain or no - added sugar yoghurt
low sugar breakfast cereals , e . g .
weetabix tm ( or similar ) or cornflakes with semi - skimmed / skimmed milk .
limit sweets and puddings and give them to your child at meal times only .
the more often your child eats sugary foods , the more likely they are to get tooth decay .
give milk and water .
dilute fresh fruit juice and take with meals .
sugar is the main cause of tooth decay .
sweetened juices , squashes and fizzy drinks are a major source of tooth decay .
how do i know how much sugar is in food ?
the labels on prepared foods and drinks you buy show their sugar content .
the earlier that sugar appears in the list of ingredients on the label , the more sugar there is in the food .
if you are helping your child , stand behind them with their head tilted slightly back .
encourage your child to open wide to clean the inside surfaces and chewing surfaces .
it ' s easier to reach the outside surfaces of the teeth at the back if the mouth is half shut .
as your child gets older , encourage them to practise with your help .
fluoride ?
what is fluoride ?
the most common cause of this condition in scotland is due to children ' eating ' fluoride toothpaste .
who needs fluoride ?
how much fluoride in water is needed to protect teeth ?
one part fluoride to one million parts of water - 1ppm .
how much fluoride is in scotland ' s water supply ?
although fluoride is present naturally in scotland ' s water , nearly all levels are much less than the required 1ppm .
the department of health recommends that all new - born babies are given a vitamin k supplement at birth .
if it will help , discuss this with your doctor , midwife or health visitor
vitamin k for babies : why ?
very rarely , a new born baby may start to bled , for no reason .
this is bad for the baby ' s health and might even cause the baby to die .
what is vitamin k ?
vitamin k is a vitamin which occurs naturally in food especially in liver and some vegetables .
during early infancy when fed entirely on milk , babies have very little vitamin k .
vitamin k deficiency bleeding - the risks
what is vkdb ?
bleeding happens unpredictably in some babies and it ' s not possible to identify babies as high or low risk with absolute certainty .
which babies are at greater risk ?
bleeding after 24 hours following birth is more common and babies at greater risk are those who :
have bleeding or spontaneous bruising in early infancy .
there are two methods of giving vitamin k to your baby :
the department of health recommends that breast feeding is preferred over artificial or bottle milk where possible .
one dose is given at birth , by the midwife or other healthcare professional . it does not need to be repeated .
this method can be just as good as having an injection but only if doses are repeated .
two doses are advised in the first week for all babies .
on this regime it is essential that you make sure the third dose is given .
breast feeding gives babies the best start in life .
artificial or bottle milk is fine though it cannot match the advantages of breast milk .
thus minor bleeds or bruising any time in the first six months , must be looked at urgently .

summary
why social exclusion is a priority
crime doubled between 1980 and 1995 .
and in the early 1990s , some 2,000 people were sleeping rough in central london each night .
in many cases the structure of government meant that the joined - up problems of social exclusion did not receive a joined - up response . in particular :
it was poor at reintegrating those who had become excluded .
the government ' s approach
the government has committed itself to annual reporting on its anti - poverty strategy in opportunity for all .
getting the basics right - delivering basic minimum standards to everyone - in health , education , in - work income , employment and tackling crime .
a ' rights and responsibilities ' approach that makes government help available , but requires a contribution from the individual and the community .
results
16 . many aspects of social exclusion are deeply entrenched , and eliminating them is a long - term project .
but results are already starting to come through .
17 . action to prevent social exclusion is delivering results :
under - 18 conception rates have fallen in four out of the last five quarters ;
more 16 - 18 year olds are staying on in education ;
the care leavers strategy has been introduced ;
the rough sleepers unit is piloting new approaches to end the fast track to homelessness from prison and the armed forces ;
stakeholder pensions will help moderate earners build up better pension entitlements from this april .
18 . and programmes to reintegrate people who have become excluded are recording successes :
since 1997 more than 270,000 young unemployed people have moved into work through the new deal for young people ;
19 . and changes in basic public and private services are focusing improvements on the poorest :
the most improved area was tower hamlets , with an increase of 23 per cent ;
but many of the programmes in this document are only in their infancy , and are on course to deliver more substantial results over time .
the future
21 . for the future , the government will be :
sustaining the investment that has been made ;
maintaining an open working relationship with those outside government ;
raising standards once current targets are met ; and
extending the new approach to other areas that have not yet been radically reassessed or where new problems emerge in future .
not working , or working on average less than 16 hours a week ?
income - based jsa is based on how much the law says you need to live on .
you cannot usually get jsa if you are aged under 18 , see page 9 .

- make sure you understand the rules for jsa
- discuss the kinds of work you are looking for and the best ways of finding a job
- give you information about jobs , training and other opportunities

you and the adviser will make this agreement at this interview , and you will both sign it .
in some situations you may be able to get a reduced allowance under the hardship provision .
hardship provision
you may be able to get a reduced amount of jsa under the hardship provision .
you can do this if your jsa cannot be paid under the normal rules for any of the following reasons :
- you are not available for work
- you unreasonably make yourself unemployed .
- there is a doubt about whether any of these apply to you
- you have not yet had a decision on your jsa
you must be able to show that you or someone in your household would suffer hardship if you do not receive any jsa .
if you are in a vulnerable group and you qualify for a hardship payment , you will be paid the next time you would usually get your jsa .
you are in a vulnerable group if you or your partner :
- are looking after children
- are single and looking after a 16 or 17 year old
- have a disability
- are caring for someone who is long - term sick or disabled
whether you get a crisis loan will depend on your particular circumstances .
before you get any money you will have to agree how you will pay the loan back .

what you can do about noise
it is a fact of life that we all make noise .
what is a noise to one person may be pleasurable to another .
excessive noise can reduce the quality of life and , in some extreme cases , even destroy it entirely .
unexpected sound , repetitive bass beats , screeches or whines can be just as annoying .
below we have illustrated some examples of typical sound levels .
in the next section we tell you what to do about these and other noises which are a problem .
120 disco - 1m in front of loudspeaker
90 heavy goods vehicle from pavement powered lawnmower at operator ' s ear
vacuum cleaner at 3m or a telephone ringing at 2m
boiling kettle at 0.5m
refrigerator humming at 2m
section 1 bothered by noise
who do i complain to ?
if you want to make a complaint about noise , you should contact your local authority , usually the environmental health department .
there is no set level at which noise becomes a statutory nuisance .
like you , the local authority may try to resolve the problem informally .
if this fails and they are satisfied that the noise amounts to a statutory nuisance they must serve an abatement notice .
this may require the noise to be stopped altogether or limited to certain times of the day .
codes of practice give advice about the minimisation of problems caused by potentially noisy activities .
courts must have regard to relevant codes approved by the secretary of state when considering the defence of best practicable means .
the london local authorities act 1991
any complaint made to the ombudsman must be brought within 12 months of the event / omission complained of .
before the ombudsman will investigate a complaint the council must have a chance to answer it .
complaining to a magistrates ' court
the magistrates court will need to be persuaded that the noise problem amounts to a statutory nuisance .
how do i proceed ?
try and resolve the problem informally before contacting the court , and by writing to the person responsible for the noise .
running away increases the risk of entering care and ending up homeless as an adult .
why it happens ( ch1 )
3 the main trigger for running away is family problems , which 80 per cent cite as a reason for running away .
how do services respond ? ( ch2 )
4 there is no national policy on runaways so practice varies widely .
5 runaways can consume significant amounts of police resources with each missing person taking up an average of 5 hours of police time .
the problem and why it matters
1 . poor transport contributes to social exclusion in two ways .
work
4 . transport can be a significant barrier to accessing work :
two out of five jobseekers say lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job .
one in four jobseekers say that the cost of transport is a problem getting to interviews .
access and availability : people cannot get to key places in a reasonable time , reliably and safely .
this may be due to poor network coverage , frequency , and reliability of public transport or a lack of accessible facilities .
low - income households that do have a car spend nearly a quarter of their weekly household expenditure on motoring .
travel horizons : people are unwilling to travel long journey times or distances , or may lack trust in , or familiarity with , transport services .
jobseekers are typically not prepared to travel more than thirty minutes to a job .
what can be done ?
in helsinborg , sweden , and in copenhagen , bus funding is linked to performance measures and a customer survey of 25,000 passengers .
16 . practical examples of what can be done include :
shanwar was their brave and powerful leader .
this proves that this tribe existed as far back as the rig - vedic ( early vedic ) period .
in the 2nd century b . c . this entire area was known as kinnar , the land of the kiratas .
proofs for this are available in the famous stone edict ( in the sharda script ) found in the shiva temple at baij nath .
the edict refers to the settlement as the ' kir ' village ( kirat gram ) .
these tribes have now settled in the lahaui - spiti , chamba and pangi areas .
in the malana village in kulu , we have distinct proofs of the kiratas having settled there .
in the tribal areas of this region one still comes across prehistoric socio - cultural beliefs .
the kiratas , the yakshas and the nagas here are among those important tribes to which we have parallel references in the puranas and history .
of these 7,69,572 belong to the scheduled castes and 1,41,610 to the scheduled tribes .
kinnaur , lahaul - spiti , kulu , chamba - pangi are tribal areas which are snow bound most of the year round .
the hills in the area are barren and the people living here have to descend to the plains in the winters , in search for animal fodder .
the climate here is cool , and healthy .
the spiti valley has a few villages at the altitude of 4,270 metres the highest in the world .
lahual has mountains 4,500 metres to 6,500 metres in height .
in 1620 , jahangir annexed the fort of kangra with the help of king jagatsingh of noorpur .
king vidhi chand of kangra defied king akbar and lost , but was pardoned .
king dipchand displayed great valour during the reign of aurangzeb .
aurangzeb rewarded him with a khillat ( a royal gift ) of five lakhs .
in the year 1707 after aurangzeb ' s death , the small hill states broke free .
their dress patterns , follow the local climate .
the people of lahaul wear long gowns and trousers but their gowns do not have mandarin sleeves like those of the tibetans .
the gaddi dress is very attractive .
all these tribes are very fond of silver ornaments .
the use of peacock feathers as ornaments shows the muslim influence .
these economic changes are being followed by quick social changes .
with this dirt he created the statue of a female and breathed life into it .
lord shiva ' s turn came last .
the primitive mind has created various myths about these two heavenly bodies .
moon in the fourth , eight and twelfth houses is considered inauspicious .
the new - born is brought out with great ceremony for his first sight of the moon .
as to why the moon is cool and the sun so hot , there is an interesting tale the sun and the moon were brothers .
their old mother asked them to rub her back .
the sun , being a little hot - tempered brought a thorny twig and scratched her back with it .
the angry mother cursed him to burn in his own fires perpetually .
he rubbed his mother ' s back gently and lovingly .
the story , with a few local variations , is common to all parts of himachal .
the eclipse there are many tales about the eclipses of the sun and the moon .
lord vishnu changed himself into the irresistible female from of mohini , and began to dance in front of the demons .
mohini quietly stole the pot and said that she would distribute it .
the demon rahu , who was very shrewd , understood the game and dressed himself as a god and went and sat among them and drank the nectar .
since rahu had had nectar , he did not die , but , instead , got divided into two demons - the head became rahu and the body ketu .
their stampede shaped the ridges and valleys upon the mountain sides .
it is also said that an increase in sins results in earthquakes as sins make the earth heavier .
at their request lord rudra agreed to take it back .
the lightening is also said to be sister to lord krishna .
as soon as it was done , the baby girl turned into a streak of lightening and flashed across the skies .
people say that onc there were two sisters .
the poor young boy went back crying to his mother , who consoled him and asked him to pray to lord vishnu for solace .
narad asked him to perform tapas to meet his master , lord vishnu .
at that time lord shiva was dancing his famous tandava dance .
the great upheavel changed the direction of the flow of the waters to the south .
services that give you a break
emotional support from other carers or people who understand
help with household tasks
help with caring tasks during the day / night
activities for the person you care for
so you may have some ideas of your own about services that would help you that you want to talk through with social services .
other services that you might want to discuss with them are those that may help the person you look after .
other things you may want social services to tell you about :
this includes information on a healthy diet and the effects of smoking in pregnancy as this can damage you and your unborn baby ' s health .
your hospital should give you a specific time for your appointments and you should be seen within 30 minutes of that time .
you should have the choice whether to have your partner or other friend or relative with you while you are in labour and giving birth .
you can decide who that will be .
for safety reasons , your baby is identified by two name labels during his or her stay in hospital .
you must be shown the labels as soon as possible so that you can check the information on them is correct .
you can keep your baby with you in hospital unless there are clinical reasons why you should not .
these should be explained to you .
you should also be able to ask for your baby to be put in the nursery if you want this .

meningitis - inflammation of the lining of the brain - can be caused by several different germs .
the bacterial germs can also cause septicaemia - blood poisoning or an infection of the blood .
meningitis caused by a virus ( viral eningitis ) is generally less serious .
bacterial meningitis is quite rare , but can be very serious .
there are three main types of bacterial meningitis .
the three types are :
haemophilus influenzae type b ( known as hib ) .
is it only children who get the disease ?
anyone of any age can get meningitis or septicaemia .
they are also given to immediate family members and anyone else who is in close contact with the person who has the disease .
antibiotics are not used for viral meningitis .
can you get meningitis by coming into contact with someone who has it ?
the germs that cause bacterial meningitis are very common and live in the back of the nose and throat .
people of any age can carry these germs for weeks or months without becoming ill .
it is only rarely that they overcome the body ' s defences and cause meningitis or septicaemia .
you can not get meningitis from water supplies , swimming pools , factories or buildings .
what is septicaemia ?
the germ enters the body from the throat and travels through the blood .
their skin may be pale and clammy , even though they have a fever .
where do you get the rash ?
the rash can appear anywhere on the body and in the early stages may be a little more than a small red spots in the skin .
it can develop very quickly , and in a matter of hours the spots can grow to red or purple bruises .
it may be more difficult to see the rash if you have a dark skin .
the spots or bruises must be taken seriously - call your doctor immediately .
( a rash is not necessarily present in every case of meningitis )
how soon should you call a doctor ?
the meningococcal germ that cases meningitis or septicaemia can be very serious .
but you can prevent the consequences by acting quickly .
if you think you or your child might have meningitis , contact your doctor immediately .
describe the symptoms carefully and ask for advice .
if you suspect meningitis or septicaemia , call your doctor immediately .
trust your instincts - a life could depend on it .
or phone their 24 - hour helpline on 01453 755049 .
measles can be a serious illness that the vaccine prevents .
mumps vaccine prevents mumps , which was the biggest cause of viral meningitis in children .
rubella vaccine prevents babies being badly damaged if their mother catches rubella when pregnant .
mmr can prevent these diseases in a combined injection .
mmr contains three separate vaccines in one injection .
the vaccines have different side effects at different times .
this is because the measles part of the vaccine is starting to work .

but bowel disease is no more common in immunised people than in people who have not been immunised .
again , there have been many studies that cannot find a link with the vaccine .
researchers found no deaths or permanent damage linked to the vaccine .
the world health organization describes mmr as a ' highly effective vaccine which has such an outstanding safety record ' .
would n ' t it be better for children to have the vaccines separately ?
no , giving the vaccines separately would leave children exposed to measles or mumps or rubella for longer .
these can be serious or even fatal diseases .
this is not the case .
children ' s immune systems make excellent responses , naturally protecting them against these diseases .
the world health organization advises against using separate vaccines because they would leave children at risk for no benefit .
where mmr is available , no countries recommend giving the vaccines separately .
measles is a highly infectious disease and it kills and disables children and adults .
mumps was the leading cause of viral meningitis in children before the mmr vaccine was introduced .
mmr protects your child and your family against measles , mumps and rubella .
if you missed your mmr appointment , you can get the immunisation at any time .
introduction
no matter who we are or what we do , we all know how precious good health is .
the plan sets out targets for the nation ' s health .
this is the first time that such targets have been set for england .
promoting good health and preventing ill - health are at the heart of " the health of the nation " .
the success of " the health of the nation " depends on getting the priorities right in all these important areas .
it also includes some practical tips for better health , and many good ideas on how we can live healthier lives .
you , your child and the law .
nobody below ten years of age in england and wales , or below 8 , in scotland , can be convicted of a criminal offence .
maximum sentences for offending against the misuse of drugs act are severe .
however , young people are unlikely to suffer the worst of these penalties .
in england and wales youngsters under 17 years of age are usually dealt with by a juvenile court .
these drugs often circulate in gymnasiums and health clubs .
it is not illegal to possess them , but it is illegal to supply them to anybody under 18 .
heroin can be injected , sniffed or smoked .
for smoking , the drug is placed on some tin foil or perhaps a spoon and then heated .
the fumes are then inhaled , a method sometimes known as ' chasing ' or ' chasing the dragon ' .
regular users say that heroin produces a sense of warm and pleasant drowsiness .
but many do n ' t realise that it is possible to fall foul of the law , even without touching drugs .
just allowing anyone on your ' premises ' to produce or supply illegal drugs to another person is itself an offence .
if you find drugs .
do i have to tell the police ?
there is a large range of drugs - some illegal , some not - that can be misused with varying effects .
by 2000 to :
reduce the number of people smoking by about a third ;
reduce the rate of breast cancer deaths among women invited for screening by at least 25 % ;
reduce the incidence of invasive cervical cancer by approximately 20 % .
by 2005 to :
halt the increase in the incidence of skin cancer .
in 1990 , they accounted for about a quarter of all deaths .
there are many types of cancers .
it is possible to help many people recover through effective treatment and care .
it is also possible to improve the quality of life for those who remain mentally ill , by improving the availability of sensitive local health and social services .
targets for accident prevention
by 2005 to :
reduce the rate of accidental deaths among children and elderly people by at least a third ;
reduce the rate of accidental deaths among young people aged 15 to 24 by at least a quarter .
accidents account for many deaths and injury among children , young adults and elderly people .
hospitals , schools and colleges can also play a part in promoting good health .
throughout our communities in general we can all do more to pass on the good news about the real benefits of good health and healthy living .
the government also has an important role to play .
it also publishes information on all aspects of health and health care .
the contribution each individual or organisation makes is important .
but if everyone works together , then the chance of this initiative making a real difference to our health is much better .
" the health of the nation " is a programme for both the present and the future .
sets out the key area for immediate action , and sets targets for the year 2000 and beyond ;
you and your health
but it is a fact , that by making gradual changes to your everyday lifestyle and habits , you can look forward to a healthier and happier life .
here are some tips to help you enjoy healthier living .
if we eat too much or indulge in the wrong sort of diet , especially one with too much fatty food , we could have health problems .
fruit
here are eight simple guidelines for a healthy diet :
enjoy your food ;
eat plenty of foods rich in starch and fibre ;
look after the vitamins and minerals in your food ;
if you drink , keep within sensible limits .
you may find it helpful to keep track of the units of alcohol you drink in a week .
drinking regularly in excess of 50 units per week for men and 35 units per week for women is definitely dangerous .
keep count of how many units you drink each week .
spread your units over the week with one or two drink - free days .
if you are thirsty , drink something non - alcoholic , or alternate alcoholic and non - alcoholic drinks .
exercise can be fun
regular physical activity can help control your weight , improve your blood circulation and help your heart work more efficiently .
it helps you to relax and , not only will you feel better , you will look better .
by regularly using your muscles , they will be firmer and in much better shape .
if you normally take the car or use public transport for just a short journey , why not try walking instead .
cycle , jog , swim , dance or do anything else you enjoy and that makes you a bit out of breath .
go up stairs rather than use the escalator or lift .
try to exercise two or three times a week for about 20 - 30 minutes at a time .
stopping smoking
if you smoke , stopping is the most effective action you can take to improve your health .
one in every five fatal heart attacks is smoking related .
smoking can harm those close you , too ; those who breathe your smoke , including your children , can become ill as a result .
you may think that stopping smoke will not be easy .
on the other hand , you will never know until you try .
lots of them tried several times before succeeding .
and for most , the first few days were the worst !
after that , the compensations make it all worthwhile .
think of the reasons why you want to stop and keep reminding yourself of them .
do n ' t be tempted to have a cigarette not even one .
every day without a cigarette is a success .
some people find it easier to give up with a friend or a group of work .
you might be able to help each other .
think about the money you are saving and what you could use the additional money for .
be aware of the risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases .
good personal and sexual relations can actively promote health and well - being .
like most things , however , sex is not risk - free and never has been .
the safest way to avoid hiv infection is to remain faithful to one uninfected partner .
remember , drug taking is often against the law , and may well damage your health .
ordinary everyday social contact with someone who has hiv is perfectly safe .
for example , the virus can not be passed through touching , sharing cutlery or cups , glasses or plates .
help
if you need advice , your gp , family planning clinic or std clinic can help .
for confidential advice and information on hiv infection and aids ring the national aids helpline free of charge on 0800 - 567123 .
the service is available 24 hours a day .
for free leaflets ring 0800 - 555777 .
be safe at home and on the roads
accidents are a major cause of death and serious ill - health , particularly in the home .
each year in england around 4,000 people die and more than 2.5 million require medical attention following home accidents .
road accidents account for the deaths of more than a further 4,000 people , including about a quarter of all deaths among school children .
they are not expensive and can save many lives and serious injuries .
only fill it one - third full of oil and turn off the heat if you leave the room .
keep dangling curtains , bed spreads and drying washing well away form fires and cookers .
stop smoking .
until you do , ensure that you dispose of ash and stubs safely .
make sure there is good lighting in hallways and stairs .
tips for the roads
wear bright colours / fluorescent clothing during the day and reflective clothing at night as a pedestrian , cyclist or motorcyclist .
seat belts can save your life .
always use a seatbelt or properly fitted child restraint when travelling in the car or taxi .
it is n ' t easy - especially when a child first tries drugs or only takes them occasionally .
many signs are just like the normal signs of growing up .
so if your child suddenly becomes moody or distant - do n ' t jump to conclusions .
sudden and regular changes of mood .
loss of appetite .
gradual loss of interest in school , hobbies , sport , friends etc
uncharacteristically drowsy or sleepy .
increasing evidence of lying or other furtive behaviour .
loss of money or other objects from the house .
unusual stains , marks or smells on the body or clothes or around the house .
this is applicable when you are in need of proper treatment due to a disability and for the same reason you are getting war pension .

waiting in an outpatients department long beyond the appointment time used to be a common experience .
more and more information is available to the public about their local health services - for example through the hospital " league " tables .
the charter may have promoted these improvements but it is staff who have made them possible .
you said that you wanted us to continue reducing waiting times .
you suggested new areas that it should cover , for example mixed - sex wards .
you said that you would like even more information about services .

staff should ask you whether you want to be called by your first or last name and respect your preference .
providing information

everyone can expect to be seen within 26 weeks .
over time the government will be working to tighten this standard further .
your care in hospital
in accident and emergency departments , 9 out of 10 patients are now seen and assessed for treatment as soon as they arrive .
you can help the nhs by using your accident and emergency department properly .
consider whether your need for treatment is urgent or whether you could be better cared for by your gp .
you can and do make a difference to your children ' s behaviour - even if it ' s hard to believe sometimes .
there are many ways for you to influence your children not to try drugs and solvents .
it ' s a basic human need , particularly for parents and children .
if it stops happening , problems and misunderstandings creep in , and you can become isolated from your children .

during the time you spend in hospital you can expect reasonable measures to be taken for your personal protection and safety .
you and , if you agree , your carers will be involved in making these decisions and kept up to date with information at all stages .

the ombudsman ' s address is :
tel : 0171 276 2035 .
the goverment intends to take further action to improve the nhs complaints procedures .
the aim is to put matters right more quickly for the patient and to use their experience to improve the quality of service for everyone .
fill in and always carry an organ donor card and tell your relatives about this .
note :
an " urban " area is one where the population density is over 2.5 people per acre .
these terms are best avoided when talking to children as they can trivialise the subject .
also you might look silly using slng terms no longer in fashion .
some prices are included as a very rough guide only ; prices will vary according to area , availability and so on .
and most of those who do will only try it once or few times .
a few youngsters may go on sniffing for a while - perhaps regularly with their friends .
a very few will carry on , sometimes very heavily , for a number of years .
who sniffs ?
children from any social class and from ' good ' homes may try sniffing .
it ' s more likely to be one of the ' disobedient ' and sometimes risky things that youngsters do .
girls sniff too , although perhaps a slightly smaller proportion than boys .
how do they do it ?
because there is a such a wide range of substances there are many ways they can be misused .
this can take new users by surprise - they become intoxicated before they realise it .
but the effects of sniffing wear off quickly , too .
what are the dangers ?
sniffing can have an effect on the heart , so it is followed by exertion or fright , death may be result .
using solvent with other drug , like alcohol , may add to the dangers .
solvents are cheap and easy to buy or steal .
in this way , hallucinations can be an exciting and sought - after part of intoxication by solvents .
why do they carry on sniffing ?
a few sniffers may use solvents in an attempt to blot out problems that they already have .
use of solvents may temporarily disguise their problems but will generally make things worse .
but it does n ' t seem like that to them at the time .
secretiveness about leisure - time activities .
any of these might be happening for other reasons .
do n ' t jump to conclusions .
remember , most young people never try solvents .
as a parent you know your own child best .
you can build your relationship together through those sometimes difficult teenage years .
at certain times in their development young people will face particularly difficult problems .
it ' s difficult to keep track of all the products that can be sniffed .
there are so many places where youngsters can get solvents .
the law does n ' t affect those solvent misusers over the age of 18 .
could the law do more ?
it ' s impractical to make solvent sniffing illegal .
anyway , this would make solvent misusers even more secretive and harder to help them .
making sniffable substances smell nasty is difficult .
manufacturers have had some success in making less harmful products , but these have not always been popular with users .
stopping people sniffing one thing may turn them to other substances which might be more dangerous .
here are some :
treat young people with more respect for their individuality and opinions ;
take an interest in young people ' s own interests and concerns ;
be actively concerned with and involved in children ' s school work ;
take part in and encourage children ' s educational and leisure activities ;
set an example by giving up smoking or alcohol ;
think about and discuss with young people the way in which medicines and prescribed drugs are used ;
keep an eye on sniffable products in the home .
store them out of reach ;
you might be able to get the local youth or recreation service to help .
a few young people are really ' stuck ' on glue or other products and it may take a long time to help them .
it is n ' t a good idea to focus on the use of solvents .
helping them with these problems will probably help them to stop sniffing .
putting plastic bags over the head is dangerous .
sniffing alone or in dangerous places , such as railway embankments and by canals , can be more risky .
telephone : 071 - 430 - 2341 .
emergency ! what do you do ?
if the person is drowsy or unconscious :
because of the small risk of ' sudden sniffing death ' , discourage exertion and keep the person calm ;
remove any solvents and make sure that there is plenty of fresh air ;
realise that this is not the best time to discuss their drug or solvent use .
try to stop them sniffing - without using force .
stay with them until the effects have worn off .

' my landlord wants me out '
throughout this booklet , ( with some exceptions ) , the terms ' landlord ' and ' tenant ' are used .
the protection from eviction act 1977
the law makes it an offence to :
or persistently withdraw or withhold services for which the tenant has a reasonable need to live in the premises as a home .
the tenant could , of course , also start his or her own court proceedings .
in the past it has been possible for a landlord to delay completing repairs in the knowledge that the inconvenience of works in progress may drive the tenant out .
repairs which are not completed
a landlord normally has a right of access to the property to carry out essential repairs .
he or she should make arrangements with the tenant to gain access at a convenient time .
the tenant should take advice as described on page 4 .
the tenant should call the police where there is actual physical assault .
the abusive behaviour could be prolonged and systematic , or could consist of isolated incidents .
a landlord ' s right to get his or her property back from a residential tenant can normally only be enforced through the courts .
do all occupiers need a court order to evict them ?
however , certain licences and tenancies are excluded from this requirement .
( ' accommodation ' in this context does not include staircases , storage areas , corridors and means of access )
to trespassers ( when granted as a temporary expedient ) ;
to those occupying a property for a holiday , or occupying it rent - free ;
licences granted to people living in certain publicly funded hostels .
see notice that you must leave and letting rooms in your home .
this means that they must not share all of it with some other person who has been granted a separate right to be there .
an agreement which is called a licence may , however , on the facts of the letting , actually be a tenancy .
what sort of tenancy is it ?
for further details see housing booklet regulated tenancies .
can the landlord end the tenancy by refusing to accept the rent ?
returning the rent to the - tenant does not bring the tenancy to an end .
if the tenant does not want to go to court

do you rent , or are you thinking of renting , from a private landlord ?
what is the law ?
it is up to you to agree the length of the tenancy with the landlord .
do i have to leave ?
you should leave at the end of the notice period .
what other help and advice is available .
the police
police force :
police station :
telephone number :
name of officer dealing with your case :
rank and number :
crime reference number :
they will also try to tell you about the result of the case .
if you think you may qualify :
any loss of earnings you have suffered .
any income you have received as a result of the offence ( for example social security benefits ) .
any receipts , estimates or other documents about any of these things .
the responsibility for making a claim is yours .
compensation from the offender
unlike a claim under the criminal injuries compensation scheme ( see previous section ) you cannot apply for a compensation order yourself .
it is therefore important that you tell the police if you would like to receive compensation .
they will give you a form on which you should give accurate details of your losses .
this should be supported by documentary evidence ( e . g . receipts ) where possible .
the police will then pass this information to the crown prosecution service who will make sure that the court knows about it .

employers told us that they needed about six months ' notice .
we therefore decided to submit our recommendation on a new rate to the government as soon as possible after we had taken a decision on it .
the government accepted our recommendation in the first volume on the increase to the main rate .
we also look at compliance and enforcement and suggest how the minimum wage should be reviewed in future .
we considered carefully the evidence , both written and oral , which we received from a wide range of organisations .
and we undertook a programme of regional visits throughout the uk to learn from the experience of people affected by the minimum wage .
we were concerned that if we reported in july businesses would not have sufficient time to prepare .
what we did
2 as with our previous reports , we based our recommendations on extensive research and consultation .
we commissioned 21 research projects and undertook surveys of firms in low - paying sectors and of employers participating in the new deal .
we analysed relevant data and worked with the office for national statistics ( ons ) in order to establish better estimates of the incidence of low pay .
we considered developments in the minimum wage systems of other countries .
a large number of people have benefited .
the buoyant labour market has undoubtedly helped , as has the prudent approach we took in recommending an initial rate .
some businesses reported positive changes that increased efficiency ; others reported difficulties .
at the aggregate level we could not detect an impact on the retail prices index ( rpi ) from the introduction of the minimum wage .
8 we were especially concerned about possible negative employment effects of the minimum wage .
employment has continued to grow strongly since the introduction of the minimum wage , and there were no discernible adverse effects at the aggregate level .
we considered it prudent therefore to recommend a small further increase for october 2002 before the minimum wage is reviewed in full again .
the impact on sectors affected overall and on the economy as a whole will be significantly less than that resulting from the introduction of the national minimum wage .
we estimate that any impact on inflation will be small , as is the likely impact on public sector finances .
15 the implementation of the national minimum wage to date has been a success .
we have recommended a small increase in 2002 before the rate is fully reviewed again .
our conclusions and recommendations on these matters continue to be based on wide - ranging consultation and analysis .
young people and training
2 young people have benefited from the national minimum wage without any discernible negative impact on their employment .
there is also no evidence of any adverse impact on the new deal , on apprentices or on training provided by employers .
for 18 - 20 year olds we recommend that the age coverage of the development rate should be kept under review .
the relativity between the development rate and the main rate has protected employment and training opportunities without any adverse impact on incentives to work .
impact on incomes
4 while the minimum wage affects households across the income distribution , it has had most impact on the poorest working households .
the minimum wage has led to a small reduction in poverty rates .
compliance and enforcement
5 the vast majority of employers are complying with the national minimum wage .
we are not complacent , however , because some workers continue to be underpaid .
we welcome the pilot projects being developed by the government in partnership with external agencies to promote the reporting of non - compliance .
implementation issues
the government made additional funding available for supported employment in 1999 / 2000 .
9 the social care sector is in an almost unique position because of its reliance on public funding .
future reviews
formulaic uprating would not satisfy this requirement .
reviews also need to be frequent enough that the minimum wage does not lose its effectiveness as a wage floor .
conclusion
11 the national minimum wage has an important place in the labour market and makes a difference to the living standards of many workers .
its impact must be kept under review .
the low pay commission ' s work would be assisted by standing terms of reference that enable us to plan a strategic , longer - term programme of research .
we believe that our recommendations will help ensure the continuing effectiveness of the minimum wage , both in the immediate future and the longer term .
choosing a new rate
young people and the development rate
twenty one year olds should be included in the main national minimum wage .
the age coverage of the development rate should be kept under review .
compliance and enforcement
future reviews
future uprating should be based on recommendations by the low pay commission resulting from consultation and analysis of a comprehensive range of factors .
there should be biennial reviews reporting in february for implementation in the following october .

practical food safety for businesses
what exactly is haccp ?
haccp stand for ' hazard analysis and critical control point ' .
analysing the potential hazards in an operation ;
identifying the points in the operation where the hazards may occur ;
deciding which are critical to consumer safety .
these are the critical control points ( ccps ) .
the ccps are monitored .
food safety - your responsibility
food businesses have the main responsibility for ensuring the protection of their customers .
a business that breaks the law faces the legal sanctions including improvement notices , prohibition notices and prosecution .
so if you run a food business you need to take care that you meet your obligations .
leaving food safety to chance is risky - risky to your customers ' health and lives , and risky to the health and life of your business .
where does haccp come in ?
many more businesses have yet to discover haccp , or to put it into practice .
the advantages .
problems are foreseen and forestalled ;
efficient it concentrates the control effort at the critical steps in the operation ;
economical it uses checks which can be done cheaply , quickly and easily , such as measuring time and temperature , and visual assessment ;
prompt fast checks allow rapid response when action is needed ;
on the spot the process is controlled on the spot by the operator , not by a laboratory remote from the operation .
how to set up haccp for your business
1 form a haccp team .
the team may be large or small , depending on the operation .
it should be composed of people who know and understand the business ' s food products and their uses .
2 define the process .
3 identify the hazards and work out the ccps .

support services
to help you , we ' ve arranged the booklet in four sections .
section 1
a quiet word about noise and formal action
what to do about noise from neighbours , local commercial and industrial premises and vehicles .
section 2
additional noise controls
byelaws and specific controls to deal with noise from construction sites and loudspeakers .
section 3
planning to stop the noise
how to get involved in the planning stages of a likely source of noise to ensure it does not become a problem in the future .
section 4
contacts for other organizations with an interest in noise and details of other informaion leaflets
in this booklet we hope to give you some brief but useful information on how to overcome noise problems .
noise is generally regarded as unwanted sound .
taking formal action
when informal action is not possible or fails , you can resolve the problem by taking formal action .
the most common route involves complaining to your local authority about the noise problem .
local authorities have a duty to investigate complaints from premises ( land and buildings ) and vehicles , machinery or equipment in the street .
all landlords , whether social or private , have powers to take action against tenants who are breaching their tenancy agreement .
eviction remains the ultimate sanction to be used by landlords against those who will not reform their behaviour and who continue to make their neighbours ' lives a misery .
a person on whom an abatement notice has been served has the right of appeal within 21 days of it being served .
best practicable means
this recognises that there can be technical and other limitations as far as industry is concerned .
when the nuisance arises on industrial , trade or business premises , the maximum fine is 20,000 .
the most common time for them to use this power is to stop misfiring burglar alarms .
when this happens a warrant has to be obtained for entry and the local authority officer must be accompanied by a policeman .
anti - social behaviour orders
as well as dealing with existing problems , these controls also cover noise that is expected to occur or recur .
most local authorities have a formal complaints procedure .
give fair warning of your action
working with the court
when you contact the court , tell them you wish to make a complaint under section 82 of the environmental protection act 1990 .
you will probably need to visit the court where the procedure will be explained to you and you may be asked for evidence of the problem .
this will show the magistrates that you have an arguable case .
if you serve the notice , you should keep a careful record and ensure that the notice is served well before the hearing date .
when the time comes for the hearing , you will have to attend court to give evidence .
the person responsible for the noise will very likely come to the court to defend themselves , and may even make counter - accusations .
you do not need to have a solicitor to represent you at the hearing , although you may do so if you wish .
you will need to be prepared for the possibility of having to pay the costs of taking the case to court .
these costs will include your costs , those of your solicitor if you have one , and any witnesses you may call in support of your case .
getting help with costs
legal representation is not available for this type of case through the legal aid scheme .
if you are going to represent your own case , the clerk of the court may give you advice and guidance .
alternatively you can contact your local citizen ' s advice bureau which may be able to offer assistance .
the outcome , win or lose
the order may also prohibit or restrict a recurrence of the nuisance .
the court may also impose a fine at the same time as making the order .
if an order is made the court will generally require the noise maker to pay your costs .
what if the noise maker persists ?
the theory is that when people no longer achieve a ' high ' from cannabis , they try something stronger .
however , there is nothing ' in ' cannabis itself which predisposes users to try heroin .
stimulants
these drugs stimulate the nerve system , banish tiredness for a time and produce feelings of alertness and confidence .
this is the most common illegal stimulant .
in the sixties , the drug came in pill from ( ' purple hearts ' ) .
one dose of amphetamine can last three to four hours .
the procedure for initiating a future case will be the same as for the original proceedings .
taking civil action
advice from a solicitor may be free or subsidised to those who are financially eligible under the ' green form scheme ' .
there are additional controls which can help to stop or reduce noise from particular sources .
some local authorities have made byelaws to control some noise sources .
for example , byelaws have been approved for certain kinds of noise taking place in the street or on local authority property such as parks or recreation grounds .
additional noise controls
loudspeakers in the street
your local authority has powers under section 62 of the controlof pollution act 1974 to deal with loudspeakers in the street .
a number of organisations are exempt from the general rules governing the use of loudspeakers in the street , including the police , ambulance and fire brigades .
a local authority is not required to serve an abatement notice and offenders are automatically subject to prosecution .
noise from construction sites
the act introduces an objective standard against which noise at night , from domestic premises , may be assessed .
it offers a choice of penalties , including service of a 100 fixed penalty notice .
section 3 bothered by noise
planning to stop the noise
the planning system plays a major role in reducing noise at source and there is scope for you to participate in the planning process .
structure and local plans are prepared by local planning authorities and noise should be taken into account when preparing such plans .
there is scope for public participation during the preparation of plans .
applications for planning permission are made to local planning authorities .
representations can be made to them about planning applications .
applications which are in accordance with development plans should be allowed , unless other material considerations indicate otherwise .
if development is proposed that is clearly in conflict with the plan , convincing reasons will need to be demonstrated why the proposals should go ahead .

summary
the problem and why it matters ( ch1 )
1 by the age of 16 , one in nine young people run away for at least one night .
over the course of a year there are 129,000 runaway incidents , involving 77,000 young people under 16 running away .
in 1997 there were over 21,000 runaway incidents in london and over 10,000 in manchester .
one in 10 people in low - income areas have turned down a job in the last twelve months because of transport .
young people with driving licences are twice as likely to get jobs than those without .
learning
5 . poor transport is linked to young people dropping out of college :
sixteen - to 18 - year - olds spend on average 370 a year on transport .
forty - seven per cent of 16 - to 18 - year - olds experience difficulty with this cost .
6 . for those who rely on public transport , getting to hospitals is particularly difficult , and can lead to missed health appointments :
people travel 42 per cent further than in 1975 .
13 . past policies have contributed to the problem .
transport policy focused on predicting and providing for traffic growth rather than managing demand .
14 . planning policies enabled more dispersed patterns of development , such as out - of - town shopping , leisure and office developments .
these have produced more scattered destinations and lower density housing , both of which have undermined the viability of buses , cycling and walking .
they very often cause itching , but this is not always the case , particularly when recently arrived on the head .
head lice cannot fly , jump or swim , but spread by clambering from head to head .
head lice feed by biting and sucking blood through the scalp of their host .
these are securely glued to hairs where the warmth of the scalp will hatch them out in 7 - 10 days .
lice take 6 - 14 days to become fully grown , after which they are capable of reproduction .
head lice are not fussy about hair length or condition .
c ) reducing the need to travel :
outreach and information and communication technology ( ict ) can also be a cost - effective way of tackling access problems .
25 . other changes could include ensuring that local planning authorities :
encourage higher density development including housing to help create more viable public transport networks .
fruits and walnuts are grown here in plenty and also medicinal herbs .
the state of himachal has a natural beauty all its own .
the state of himachal came into being on 15th april , 1948 after the dissolution of 81 princely states of the region .
now its area measures 55,673 square kilometres , and its population ( according to 1971 census reports ) is 34,60,434 .
it has 36 cities and 16,916 villages .
he has made detailed references to the trigarta or the jullender areas .
his references indicate that the political systems prevalent in these areas were of a primitive kind .
swords , daggers , bows and lances were the weapons used - the kings of kulu , chamba and trigarta had regular armies .
there are few instances of theft or trickery .
their permanent and semi - permanent dwelling places are in kinnaur , lahaul , pangi and gadderan ( chamba bharmaur ) .
they have their own customs , traditions , religious beliefs , dances and music which make an interesting study .
kengyur and tengyur are their religious texts .
both have some 108 volumes each .
according to the 1971 census figures , they number 35120 .
the vedas , the puranas and the ancient buddhist texts also refer to the tribe , but the present day kinnars are quite different from their predecessors .
physically they are closer to the aryan races in their tall well - built bodies , their high foreheads , large eyes and fair complexions .
temperamentally they are a gentle and softspoken people , quite content to live in poverty .
they love to drink and to eat meat .
the women however , do not drink .
their marriage customs are also very interesting .
all the brothers in a family share a wife .
however , with the rise in the literacy level this sytem is fast dying out .
what is hepatitis b ?
others have ' flu - like symptoms and yellowing of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) .
about 1 in 5 of these carriers develop serious liver disease later in life .
in the patan valley in lahaul spiti there are a few families belonging to the samvegala .
they have a system of joint families .
two brothers may have one wife and occasionally a woman may have more than one husband .
one such family has 105 members who are working at different places .
families numbering between 8 to 21 are common .
gujjarsthe gujjars are a nomadic tribe .
they are wanderers and like living in tents or under the open skies .
milk and corn meal are their staple food .
according to the last census figures their number in the himachal pradesh was 20644 .
he praised them to their king and expressed a desire to have them come to live in his kingdom .
since originally they were hindus , their gotra system is the same as that of the hindus .
they love embroidery .
the central government is trying to provide them with permanent accommodation .
sangh is also making efforts in this direction .
their sheep and goats are known as dhan ( property ) .
before the advent of the machines they also earned their living , by pounding millet and carrying loads .
their marriage customs are similar to those of the hindus .
their houses are small , surrounded by gardens and full of decorative articles .
most of them are in the armed forces .
dharma - shala ( mcleod - gunj ) has a large number of these .
the buddhist temple , the palace of the dalai lama and tibetan dispensary are great tourist attractions here .
each village has people belonging to different castes and income groups .
these tribes also help each other in following the rituals and customs at the time of a death or a birth .
the larger farms lie outside the villages and are owned by a few rich landlords .
the new land reforms and legislations have changed the situation to a certain extent .
the farms are named after the types of soil , rivers or rivulets or gods and goddesses .
the villages follow a panchayat system .
the special protection that our laws have given them have helped them secure good jobs within the fields of administration , the judiciary and the armed forces .
most jobs are done on a cooperative level in the villages , and so they cost very little or nothing .
the sister is highly respected and other relationships are also given due importance .
the cattle houses are close to the house .
shiva is the chief god especially among the gaddis . vishnu , krishna and buddha are also worshipped .
kulu , sirmaur , mandi and kangra have numerous holy temples and ponds to prove this .
shiva agreed to do all this , provided that he was also given the sun and the moon , the morning star and the brija stone .
there he found the white bull and the black bull and suspended above them the brija stone .
but even after all this , the earth seemed empty and colourless without man .
so at the end lord shiva decided to create man .
once lord vishnu lay thinking upon his serpent - bed in the milky sea of creativity , about the creation of the universe .
at that time , due to his tejas , a lotus flower grew out of his navel , upon which sat lord brahma .
the mother blessed him and told him that his glow would always remain cool and gentle .
since then the moon has been cool and the sun , scorching hot .
the moon changed himself into a cock and began to crow at midnight .
the rishi , thinking that the day had dawned , left for the river for his ritual bath .
as the rishi entered the river , the river told him about indra ' s trick .

when they saw the young cow * herd milking their cows , they realized that there was something divine and magical about the spot .
at night a village elder had a dream which indicated that there were seven goddesses buried beneath the spot .
when the young girl began churning , all of a sudden enormous lumps of butter appeared in the pot .
the valley where she wept turned black ; the earth there is still black in colour .

mmr information pack for health professionals
mmr - the facts
the decision to immunise your child is never simple .
what is mmr ?
it is given to children at 13 months and again before they go to school .
the second dose protects anybody who did not respond to the first dose .
this usually gets better on its own , but if you see spots like this , show them to your doctor .
about three to four weeks after the injection a child might occasionally get a mild form of mumps as the mumps part of mmr kicks in .
very rarely , children can have severe allergic reactions straight after any immunisation ( about 1 in 100,000 immunisations for mmr ) .
if the child is treated quickly , he or she will recover fully .
people giving immunisations are trained to deal with allergic reactions .
the table below compares the serious effects of the disease and reactions to mmr .

no , autism was well known long before mmr was ever used in this country .
there was no sudden increase in autism when mmr was introduced .
extensive research into this possibility shows that there is no link between mmr and autism .
a personal message from the chief medical officer
i have no doubt that mmr is the safest way for parents to protect their children .
i understand how difficult it can be for parents to get the facts they need to make a positive decision .
the leaflet draws on the latest studies both here and around the world .

papers to support your complaint
the national health service is a service for everybody .
for many people and their families it is the most important public service in their lives .
patients must always come first .
this was the message at the heart of the patient ' s charter when it was launched four years ago .
since that time the charter has had an enormous impact on improving the quality of services .
of course things sometimes go wrong and the charter makes clear the standards that ought to be reached .
however , a great deal has been achieved .
for example :
waits of over two years for an operation were once not unknown .
listen to and act on people ' s views and needs ;
set clear standards of service ;
provide services which meet those standards .
sets out your rights and the standards of service you can expect to receive ;
introduces a number of new national standards ;
throughout this booklet we refer to :
exceptional circumstances may sometimes prevent these standards being met .
receive health care on the basis of your clinical need , not on your ability to pay , your lifestyle or any other factor ;
have access to your health records , and to know that everyone working for the nhs is under a legal duty to keep your records confidentia ;
many health authorities and hospitals have their own charters , adding to and improvig on national standards .
your hospital should openly display information on their charter performance in public places .
these show how local hospitals and ambulance services are doing against some of the national standards .
arrangements for giving you the results of any medical tests ;
arrangements to help you look after your health ;
facilities for parents with children ;
facilities for people with disabilities ;
when it is and is not appropriate to call on your gp for out - of - hours treatment ;
more and more gp practices are producing their own charters for their patients .
you will be told their name .
you can expect to receive a visit from your health visitor :
irresponsible use of the 999 service can cost lives .
please call 999 only in emergencies .
the fhsa aims to :
acknowledge your comments , suggestions and complaints within two working days ;
sort out informal complaints within one month of getting them ;
sort out formal complaints within six months of getting them ( formal complaints are handled under legal rules ) ;
give you and your gp a progress report every month until your complaint has been sorted out .
if you want to pursue a complaint about hospital or community services , contact the general manager or chief executive of the hospital concerned .
there are no clear - cut signs and symptoms that will identify someone who has been sniffing .
look out for :
chemical smell on clothes or breath .
sudden change in behaviour or lifestyle , for example going around with a new set of friends .
loss of appetite .
asking for money without explaining what it is for .
to you these might not always like severe difficulties , but for young people problems like these can loom large .
your help can make all the difference .
only a few prosecutions have been brought under this act .
if they persist , the police can be informed .
but the law ca n ' t solve the problem of solvent misuse .
this booklet deals only with harassment of people whom somebody is trying to drive out of their homes .
it can take many forms short of physical violence .
it may not always be obvious to outsiders that particular sorts of activity are intended to drive the tenant from the property .
there are things the tenant can do in a wide range of circumstances , some of which are outlined below .
* at time of going to press
where should i go for advice ?
if physical violence is involved , her or she should contact the police .
if the evidence justifies it , they can carry out an investigation and prosecute if they believe an offence has been committed .
is this harassment ?
withdrawal of services
this is awkward as there are two ( or more ) tenants .
in certain circumstances , not supplying a key may constitute harassment .
anti - social behaviour by landlord ' s agent
demand for excessive repairs
in some circumstances , if the works are the tenant ' s responsibility , he or she may be eligible for an improvement grant .
check with the local authority .
failure to carry out repairs
in the case of most short leases the landlord is responsible under the landlord and tenant act 1985 for keeping in repair :
the structure and exterior of the home , including the drains , gutters and external pipes ;
the installations for the supply of water , gas and electricity and sanitation , which he or she must keep in proper working order ;
local authorities have powers to oblige a landlord to carry out repairs .
these powers apply to :
major repairs , and
a council may serve a notice on a landlord requiring him or her to carry out the necessary repair or works .
if the landlord then fails to do so , the council may carry out the works itself
a tenant should not be reluctant to complain to the local environmental health or housing department for fear of victimisation .
the housing act 1988 should help to reassure tenants who complain to their local authority about the condition of their home .
get help for you and your child
your child may need more help than you can provide .
think about people you know who might be able to help .
there are many agencies and groups who will also be willing and able to support you .
there is more information about these at the end of this leaflet .
you will need support if you are to be able to give the best you can to your child .
look for gradual change if your child is taking drugs regularly they are not likely to stop suddenly .
any improvement may be gradual , with , perhaps , some slip ups on the way .
the tenant should continue to offer the rent , and should seek advice from a solicitor , housing aid centre or citizens advice bureau .
can a tenant be compensated for having been harassed or illegally evicted ?
normally the market value of an untenanted property is greater than the value of the property with the tenant in it .
a tenant may want to return home despite the events that have caused him or her to leave .
any housing advice centre and citizens advice bureau should also be able to give advice on landlord and tenant issues .
this is not necessarily as difficult or offputting as the tenant might imagine .
letting rooms in your home ( 92 hug 219 )
notice that you must leave ( 92 hug 220 )
regulated tenancies ( 92 hug 221 )
a guide for tenants ( 97 hc 228a )
your council ' s housing department will be able to give you advice about this .
how does your right to manage work ?
every tenants ' organisation should have a constitution which shows how :
often members of the organisation should meet ;
the organisation ' s committee members should be elected ;
if your tenants ' organisation wants to have the right to manage , it must tell the council in writing .
it must also tell the council which homes it wants to manage .
if you are claiming other benefits or your income is low , you may be able to get help through housing benefit .
if you still owe at least this amount of rent at the time of the court hearing , the judge will give the landlord a possession order .
what if my housing benefit is delayed ?
what can i do if i think the rent is too high ?
victims of crime
this leaflet explains what will happen now you have reported a crime to the police .
how the crime will be investigated and what will happen if you have to go to court ;
how you may be able to get compensation if you have been injured or if your property has been stolen or damaged ;
they must then consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest .
for the purposes of investigating an offence , catching criminals or for crime prevention , the police may release details of a case to the press .
but if you are concerned about the release of case details , tell the police officer dealing with your case .
sudden changes of mood from happy and alert to sullen and moody ;
unusual irritability or aggression ;
loss of appetite ;
loss of interest in hobbies , sport , schoolwork or friends ;
increased evidence of telling lies or furtive behaviour ;
unexplained loss of money or belongings from the home ;
unusual smells , stains or marks on the body or clothes , or around the house ;
what about the law ?
the role of the court
the court must take account of the offender ' s circumstances and ability to pay .
so if the court does decide to make an order , it may not be for the full amount of your loss .
if the offender has enough money , the compensation will normally be paid in a lump sum .
in most cases , however , the court will allow time for the offender to pay , or may allow the offender to pay by instalments .
it is the job of the court to make sure that the offender pays the compensation .
so if you have any questions about the compensation order or the way it will be paid to you , you should contact the clerk of the court .
to be given advice about applying for compensation for personal injury from the criminal injuries compensation authority ; and
to be given crime prevention advice by the police if you ask for it .
report the crime to the police promptly ;
give the police full details of your injury or loss ;
tell the police if you fear for your ( or your family ' s ) safety ;
tell the police if you do not want your name and contact details passed to victim support ;
for any type of crime , you can also contact them yourself at a later date if you prefer .
because resources are limited , victims whose cars are stolen or vandalised will not normally be referred to victim support .
if you need help , tell the police officer in your case or contact victim support direct .
your local victim support scheme is :
take precautions against danger from flammable or explosive hazards , electrical equipment , noise and radiation ;
avoid hazardous manual handling operations , and where they cannot be avoided , reduce the risk of injury
provide health surveillance as appropriate ;
provide free any protective clothing and equipment , where risks are not adequately controlled by other means ;
ensure that appropriate safety signs are provided and maintained ;
as an employee you have legal duties too .

those responsible for providing public services will need to ensure that their policies and services are fair .
there are separate duties for schools , and further and higher education institutions .
what do the duties mean for public sector employers and employees ?

2.16 the concept of institutional racism has been much discussed , and its definition much debated .
as such , it is an ailment which is curable , and the cure may be more or less effective , and more or less permanent .
the latter is an issue for the entire legal profession , and for the university law schools .
internal reports
the report was originally prepared as a confidential document , but was published before it had been completed .
the methodology was inadequate , and this inquiry has not relied on the internal report , but has gone back to the primary sources .
the conclusions however , which are reviewed in detail , largely accord with the findings of this inquiry .
2.26 strathclyde police also commissioned an internal review of their handling of the criminal investigation in this case , in 1999 .
this is an unpublished document , but the inquiry has been given access to it and has examined it critically .
the remit given to the reviewing officer was vague and unfocused , and the review itself lacked rigour .
2.36 specific recommendations made at points throughout the report are summarised at the end of the final chapter .
these are our standards of service for handling work permit applications .
they are the minimum standards you should expect .
we hope that you will play your part in helping us achieve these standards .

chairman ' s foreword to the report summary
1 the national minimum wage has now been in place for almost two years .
the minimum wage has brought benefits to many low - paid workers without any significant negative impact on employment or the economy .
this major intervention in the labour market , which many considered controversial even a couple of years ago , is now widely accepted throughout the uk .
and around 70 per cent of beneficiaries have been women , hence the minimum wage has contributed to a significant narrowing of the gender pay gap .
2 we produced the report in two volumes .
5 the treatment of young people poses a considerable challenge .
key to this is our recommendation on the way that the minimum wage should be reviewed in future .
as one of the commissioners has noted , this has been a shared and mutual education .
we have laid a firm foundation on which a future approach can safely be built .
june 2001
report summary
( published march 2001 )
our task
1 in may 2000 , the government gave us new terms of reference .
the government asked us to report by july 2001 with a view to it implementing changes in october 2001 .
5 it appears that the substantial majority of workers have been receiving their entitlement , but we will make a fuller assessment of compliance in the second volume .
as a result of the minimum wage , the overall earnings distribution and the gender pay gap have narrowed .
our latest estimate of the initial impact of the minimum wage on the national wage bill is 0.35 per cent .
this is lower than the estimate in our second report , largely because of the reduction in the estimated number of beneficiaries .
6 the large majority of firms affected by the minimum wage have managed to adapt , even if that has sometimes been a significant challenge .
if you or parner get income support or family credit .
if you are regigtered blind or partially sighted .
if you are diagoned diabetic or are suffering from glaucoma .
if you need certain very strong lenses .
food law inspections and your business
choosing a new rate
11 we looked at the evidence in the context of the current economic situation , but recognised that a new rate needed to be sustainable in less favourable conditions .
we therefore considered prospects for the near - term future and analysed recent trends in prices , earnings and pay settlements .
who will inspect your business ?
environmental health officers and trading standards officers have the right to enter and inspect food premises at all reasonable hours .
they do not have to make an appointment and they will usually come without notice .
they carry out routine inspections and may also visit as a result of a complaint .
some premises may be inspected at least every six months , others much less often .
they will discuss any problems with you and advise on possible solutions .
they also have powers which they can use when they think it necessary to protect the public .

the prevention and treatment of head lice
they do not always cause itching , particularly when recently arrived on the head .
they may also be few in number and a quick inspection is unlikely to detect them .
the following method of detection is effective :
once the comb moves freely through the hair , without dragging , switch to a fine tooth comb .
actual size in stages of growth of the head louse .
check all family members at the same time and arrange treatment when lice are found .
treatments
if you find lice , then there are two options .
you may therefore wish to undertake occasional checks during hair washing sessions .
option 1 : lotions and creme rinses using insecticides
do not use lotions or rinses unless you find a living moving louse .
elsewhere , complaints should be made directly to aircraft operators or aerodrome owners .
claims for loss , injury or damage resulting from military flying should be made to :
compensation from noise from aerodromes

background and next steps
2 the government will be consulting on how to develop a national service framework for young runaways .
a " bug buster " teaching pack is available to assist this process .
for further information send three 2nd class stamps loose , plus a self - addressed sticky label to the above address .
7 the report sets out the elements of an effective system for dealing with runaways .
it then asks what more needs to be done , building on current and forthcoming policies , to develop this framework .
to reduce the inequalities in pollution and child pedestrian accidents between deprived communities and the national average .
21 . changes in three areas are required to achieve these objectives :
a ) mainstream transport
b ) specific transport for pupils , patients , social services clients and jobseekers
c ) reducing the need to travel
clearer accountability at a local level to improve access work , learning and health care , through accessibility and impact planning .
many mythologically and historically famous towns are located along the banks of these rivers .
fruits and walnuts are grown here in plenty and also medicinal herbs .
head lice
full grown lice take the opportunity to move from head to head during close contact .
younger lice tend to remain for about 6 days on the head where they have hatched .
head lice need to maintain contact with a host in order to survive .
there is no need to wash or fumigate clothing or bedding that comes into contact with head lice .
according to the rigveda many human tribes occupied the area before the arrival of the aryans .
the region where his ear ( ran ) fell , came to be known as kangarh and later as kangra .
the mahabharata also refers to the kangra , kulu and audambar ( pathankot ) kingdoms .
after 1930 , the freedom movement gained strength here .
on the 15th of august , 1947 , india became independent .
the brahmin priests and astrologers help them practice their religion .
some prominent brahmin branches are those of shrotriyas the dixits , the nagas , the panch karmas and the padhes .
the rajput soldiers from kangra and hamirpur areas are well known for their qualities of bravery and loyalty .
ghirath , chahang , suni are a few other castes where people are professional farmers .
the ahirs own windmills and catch fish .
doomna , chamar ( cobblers ) and jiilahas ( weavers ) follow their paternal professions .
the doomna work with cane and create beautiful objects for daily use .
all these castes are divided into the categories of kachha , pakka , nagar kotiya and bhatedu .
they are open , warm and completely reliable .
how can you get hepatitis b infection ?
hepatitis b virus is carried in the blood and body fluids .
there are three main ways that infection is spread :
from an infected mother to her baby during birth ;
by sexual intercourse with an infected person without a condom ;
why is hepatitis b infection serious for babies ?
without vaccination , many babies born to mothers who are hepatitis b carriers will become infected .
sunar went up to the sleeping king and painted some golden alphabets upon his palm .
sunar agreed to do so , but said that he would first have to heat them in fire .
he then came and offered it to the goddess , but only after having first hidden the gold of the alphabets among the ashes .
the pandavas then chopped off the ear of the dead demon king and buried it in the foundation of the goddess ' s temple .
cocaine is a white powder which is usually sniffed , but can also be injected .
crack or freebase is cocaine that can be smoked .
crack is also expensive ; each small crystal can cost 20 and it lasts only about 10 - 20 minutes .
the effects start after about 20 minutes and can last several hours .
they will be reviewed on a regular basis , and the new key areas may be added or substituted in the future .
the government has set a series of challenging targets in each key area .
the key areas
coronary heart disease and stroke . targets : by the year 2000 to :
reduce the death rate form stroke among people under 75 by at least 40 % ;
reduce the number of people smoking by about a third ;
it also causes heart disease and is recognised as one of the major causes of chest diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema .
mental illness
mental illness targets
improve significantly the health , social functioning and quality of life of people who are mentally ill .
by the year 2000 to :
reduce the national suicide rate by 15 % .
the cost is high in term of human misery and family suffering .
many people do not realise that they have been infected with hiv until they develop symptoms of aids .
this may not happen for many years .
although the number of cases of gonorrhoea has been declining over the last ten years this has not been the case more recently .
it also includes family planning , which can play an important part in the health of children and the well - being of families .
what we can do ?
the main aim of the " the health of the nation " is to improve the health of the people of england .
if we are going to create a healthier nation , we all have an important role to play .

11 . does the patient know that you are making a complaint and support it ?
about the organisation you are complaining against
14 . was your complaint made in writing ?
15 . have you received a reply ?
this new expanded and updated charter responds to those views .
it introduces new standards in more areas and improved waiting time guarantees .
for the first time ever we have set a national standard for waiting for a first appointment as an outpatient .
because drugs are easy to get hold of .
many of these reasons for trying drugs and solvents might seem ridiculous to us .
however , they might seem very real to our children .
when you are young tomorrow does n ' t exist - you live for today .
whose children get involved with drugs ?
there is not always an obvious explanation for it .
what ' s important is that you can help influence your children not to start using drugs or solvents .
how you can help your children ?
copies are available from the health literature line on 0800 555777 .
you can expect your local family health services authority ( fhsa ) to find you a gp within two working days .
the nhs now achieves this standard fully .
you have the right to change your gp easily and quickly .
this means within two working days for urgent cases and six weeks for all other cases .
you have the right to :
you have the right to be described appropriate drugs and medicines .
opening times and how to make appointments and what you should do if you have to cancel ;
it is also possible that single - sex accommodation may not be available at the time proposed for your admission .
the standards will mean that :
you have to order no more than your next two meals in advance ;
you have a choice of the size of portion you want ;
you are given the name of the catering manager ;
your optometrist
an optometrist ( or ophthalmic optician ) tests sight and prescribes glasses and contact lenses .
glasses and contact lenses are not supplied through the nhs but some people can get help with their costs .
a certificate in the pharmacy will show your pharmacist ' s name .
you have the right to :
you can expcet your medicines and medical appliances to be supplied in suitable containers and be labelled with clear instructions on how to use them .
you can see a pharmacist without an appointment .
when any medicine is not in stock , you can expect to be told when it will be available .
warning - do n ' t keep old medicines around the house .
not butting in all the time - do n ' t insist on your own views being heard , listen to those of your child .
tell them about you
you might want to point out that being able to talk through problems is helpful .
it will help you if you can show that you do appreciate what it ' s like for them .
it ' s not necessarily giving them the answer - or boring them with your own stories from the past .
if you want more information
call free on 0800 665544 for information on any nhs service .
how you can help the nhs .
this will help us to see someone else instead ;
tell your doctor or hospital if you change your name , address or telephone number ;
return equipment such as wheelchairs , crutches , walking sticks or frames when you no longer need them so they can be used by other patients ;
give us your comments and suggestions - so that we can improve services whenever possible ;
butane gas and aerosols may be sniffed from bags , but are sometimes sprayed directly into the mouth .
thinners such as tipp - ex may be sniffed from a cloth or a coatsleeve .
some may put their heads inside a plastic bag .
where do they do it ?
so people can sniff while walking around , they can sniff in school or anywhere around their home .
some may go to out - of - the - way places to sniff which can add to the dangers .
what are the effects ?
young and inexperienced users run greater risks .
if solvent misusers become unconscious they may choke on their own vomit .
if they have problems , help is not at hand .
some people are more vulnerable than others to the harmful effects of solvents and may suffer lasting damage .
why do they do it ?
it just means showing them that you are sensitive to their problems .
try looking at the world through their eyes !
although you ca n ' t be around all the time , your children want to feel you ' re always interested in them .
firmness does not mean having to be aggressive .
if you are consistent , you can stop your children saying that you are " being unfair " .
if they do say it , it wo n ' t be true !
if you set your stall out , your children know what ' s on offer and what to expect .
do things together
spending time with your children and talking to them are important .
but it ' s also worth planning things you can do together regularly .
it ' s vital for children to have interests which give them an alternative to using drugs .
encourage these interests , and you will have done something very important for your child .
make friends with their friends
friends can have a lot of influence on what your child does .
your child can feel under a lot of pressure to go along with the crowd .
let them have somewhere they can be together .
that way , you can still have some influence over what they do .
remember your child is unique
all children have strengths , and they all need to feel valued and good about themselves .
sometimes those strengths can be hard to find , but they do exist .
you can help your child develop and build on them .
in turn , this makes them want to do more constructive things than use drugs .
why do teeth decay ?
a sticky film of bacterial plaque constantly forms on teeth .
plaque bugs convert the sugars in foods and drinks to acids .
the more often that sugary foods and drinks are taken , the greater the risk of tooth decay .
how can i protect my child ' s teeth ?
there are four things you can do .
sugars - encourage children to enjoy food and drinks that have not been sweetened .
limit the amount and number of times a day your child has sweetened foods and drinks .
toothbrushing - brush in the morning after breakfast and at night after your child ' s last meal / snack / drink .
fluoride toothpaste - use a pea - sized amount .
sucrose
dextrose
maltose
invert sugar
so try to limit your use of foods containing these .
should i help my child to brush their teeth ?
use only a small pea - sized blob of standard fluoride tooth - paste ( 1000ppm ) and ask your child to spit and not rinse .
what ' s the best way to brush ?
what does fluoride do for teeth ?
how does fluoride work ?
it works in two ways :
what fluoride does my child need ?
fluoride varnish : your dentist may also recommend fluoride varnish .
can my child have too much fluoride ?
what is a fissure ?
fissures are the grooves and cracks on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth .
what is a fissure sealant ?
it is a plastic coating which is painted onto the grooves and cracks on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth .
when should fissure sealants be applied ?
fissure sealants can be an important part of your child ' s preventative dental care .
they may also be applied to milk teeth .
set an example
use of any of them can cause problems , such as alcohol dependency .
it gives them signals about how you regard drugs .
there are a few pitfalls to avoid .
do n ' t bully your children - no one reacts well to bullies
do n ' t lecture - remember how it felt to be lectured at ?
do n ' t preach - being " holier than thou " does not help a child who need help !
it does n ' t work - and to someone who uses drugs and has experienced their effects , it will be unbelievable .
what do i need to do and when do i need to start thinking about this ?
whether or not you would like vitamin k to be given to your baby
if you do , whether it is given by mouth or by injection .
this leaflet will help you do just that .
we hope the information given in this leaflet will help you to make your choice .
of course , there ' s no substitute for talking the issues through with your midwife , health visitor or doctor .
you wo n ' t always be able to see the bleeding .
what ' s the risk ?
very small .
but this slight risk is eliminated when your baby is given a vitamin k supplement in sufficient amounts .
ca n ' t high - risk babies be recognised ?
if your child is already using drugs
if you find out your child is using drugs or solvents , stay calm and do n ' t panic .
have you got the facts right ?
how can you keep the communication lines open ?
is their drug - taking a repeated pattern , or was it a one - off " experiment " ?
if it is one - off you may need to simply to talk to them .
be firm , consistent and caring , but disapproving .
give your child some reasons for rejecting the misuse of drugs :
that it ' s illegal and could lead to trouble with the police ;
the right to compensation applies to nearly all council tenants .
your council can tell you if you qualify .
do you need permission to make improvements ?
you should get permission first , you can apply for it when you claim for compensation .
what kind of improvements can you get compensation for ?
the right to compensation applies to improvements which were started on or after 1 april 1994
kitchen sink and work surfaces for preparing food ;
central heating , hot water boilers and other types of heating ;
the council may also adjust your compensation - up or down - depending on the condition of the improvement when you claim .
what can you claim compensation for ?
you can claim compensation for :
you will need to give the council an invoice to show how much your improvements cost .
if you have not got an invoice , tell the council straight away and give them a rough idea of the total cost .
protection against harassment and illegal eviction
this booklet does not give an authoritative interpretation of the law ; only the courts can do that .
the protection from eviction act 1977 2
where should i go for advice ? 4
withdrawal of services 5
withholding keys 5
anti - social behaviour by landlord ' s agent 5
demand for excessive repairs 6
failure to carry out repairs 6
repairs which are not completed 8
threats and physical violence 8
illegal eviction 9
do all occupiers need a court order to evict them ? 9
that drug taking could affect their health now and in the future .
if your child ' s health or behaviour shows that they are taking drugs regularly , you must take further action .

your support for your child is vital whatever the circumstances .
you can build your relationship with them and show that you love and care for them .

remember , even though you have the right to manage , the council still owns your home .
what services can you manage ?
the management agreement lists all the services you can manage yourselves .
here are a few of them :
it ' s not your fault !
young people do n ' t always take drugs because they have deep personal problems or to show how they reject your way of life .
repeated drug taking can have serious results .
how do you know if your child is using drugs ?
it ' s not easy to tell , particularly when a child first takes drugs or only takes them occasionally .
many of the signs are like those of growing up .
be sure of your facts before you do anything .
it ' s important not to jump to conclusions if you notice any of the following things :
however , the landlord cannot force you to leave , but may apply to a court for a possession order .
the court will then appoint bailiffs to evict you .
am i entitled to a written tenancy agreement ?
if your landlord has not given you a written agreement , you can ask him or her to give you a written statement setting out :
the date the tenancy began ;
the rent and when it is payable ;
any rent review arrangements ;
can i get help with the rent ?
my tenancy began before 28 february 1997 .
what is my position ?
your landlord may agree to let you stay longer but he or she does not have to .
if you are an assured tenant , you can usually stay as long as you want .
your landlord can only seek to evict you on grounds of rent arrears if you owe at least 3 months or 13 weeks rent .
give them as much information as you can about the offence ;
tell them if you are worried about your ( or your family ' s ) safety so they can give you appropriate advice .
tell them if the offence was made worse by racial abuse or hatred directed at you .
what happens next ?
the police will try to catch the criminal , but they may not always succeed .
you ca n ' t get compensation twice for the same thing from public funds .
check list for action
if you report a crime to the police you can expect :
the police to investigate the crime ;
to be contacted by victim support , unlessyou ask the police not to pass on your details1 ;
it also made it an offence to cause harassment to somebody , for example , by ' stalking ' .
those who cause harassment can receive a fine and / or up to six months imprisonment .
if the offender is convicted of breaching the restraining order he or she faces a penalty of up to five years in prison .
you may not need to appear or be identified in court , because the court can ask to hear the evidence of a professional witness .
the magistrates will decide if the grounds for an order have been satisfied .
but it is possible to break the law , even without touching drugs .
just allowing anyone on your " premises " to produce or to supply illegal drugs to another person is an offence .
if you find drugs .
do you have to tell the police ?
where can parents get help ?

conclusions and recommendations
2.27 parallels which have been drawn between this case and the stephen lawrence case are misleading .
his girlfriend , who was an eye - witness , did not see it as a racist attack ; neither did his wife .
the police officers who came to the scene made it their first priority to save his life , if they could .
2.28 elements of institutional racism are found in the organisation and procedures both of strathclyde police and the procurator fiscal service .
the recommendations of this report are tempered by that .

social , cultural and sporting activities

what are the barriers to success ?
in rural areas , pockets of deprivation can be hidden by ward - level statistics .
spending has fallen by nearly a third since 1985 , while spending on subsidising unprofitable routes has fallen by almost two - thirds .
this reflects falling operating costs during this period .
however , tender costs are now rising sharply due to driver shortages and commercial operators withdrawing routes .
since 1997 , urban and rural bus challenges have provided additional finance to address these problems .
funding equity : current transport spending is regressive .
19 . this report sets out some initial thoughts on potential improvements .
the ideas under consideration would be subject to spending review decisions .
a final report in the autumn will provide further details .
20 . to ensure the social costs of poor transport are tackled effectively , policy needs to give due weight to the following objectives :
better information and consultation would be needed to ensure pockets of deprivation , such as in rural areas , are addressed effectively .
b ) specific transport

work : a clearer deal between people seeking work and the state .
we would welcome any comments on this report .

knowing about meningitis and septicaemia
knowing the symptoms of meningitis could mean the difference between life and death .
the most common type of meningitis in children under four used to be hib .
immunisation against hib infection is now possible .
if you do not remember your child being immunised , and he or she is under four , you should contact your doctor .
now , the meningococcal germ is the most common cause of meningitis and septicaemia in all age groups .
if the illness is diagnosed early and treated quickly , most people recover completely .
but in some cases the infection can kill or lead to a permanent disability such as deafness or brain damage .
what are the symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia ?
meningitis is not easy to identify at first because the symptoms are similar to those of ' flu .
but meningitis develops quickly , sometimes in just in few hours , and the patient will soon become seriously ill .
the symptoms may not all appear at the same time , and they may be different in young babies , children and adults .
babies may have a staring expression and a fever .
they may refuse feeds or they may vomit .
they may be distressed and make a shrill or moaning cry when you pick them up .
babies with meningitis can be very difficult to wake up .
there may also be a rash of red or purple spots or bruises anywhere on body .
older children , young people and adults often have a fever , pains in their back or joints , and vomiting .
these drugs are not addictive and are not known to cause damaging physical effects on the body .
experiences will vary from visions of joy and beauty to waking nightmares .
perceptions of the world will appear distorted .
these drugs are commonly found in many medicine cabinets .
young people may experiment with them and some types may even be sold on the streets .
it is difficult to overdose these drugs , unless other sedatives ( like alcohol ) are used at the same time .
athletes claim this helps them to train harder and recover more quickly from injury .
there are many potential problems associated with these drugs .
often the drugs are injected using shared equipment with the attendant risks of infection ;
in young people , use of these drugs can restrict growth ;

it seems hard to believe that only a few generations ago thousands of people died of cholera and typhoid in england .
half of the nation ' s children failed to reach adulthood , and of those who did , few could expect to live as long as we do today .
times have changed .
the terrible diseases of dicken ' s day , such as smallpox , diphtheria and polio , are no longer a threat .
the great social developments of the last hundred years have played an important part bringing this about .
our national health service is recognised throughout the world for the excellent services it has been providing since 1948 .
successful immunisation programmes have also played an important part in our fight against disease , as the diagrams here show .
as a result of all these changes most of us now enjoy a better quality of life than ever before .
however , there is still a lot we can do to improve our lives .
although we have said goodbye to many of those threats to our health , we still have to guard against their return .
we also have to be aware that different diseases today pose new dangers .
as we learn more about them and how they can be avoided , so we can take action to protect ourselves and others .
for example , heart disease , stroke , some cancers and accidents can often be prevented or avoided by changes in the way we live .
hiv infection , which causes aids , is perhaps the greatest new public health challenge this century .
by most standards our health is already getting better .
these improvements are welcome , but there is still more that needs to be done .
further progress could be made by making simple changes in the way we live .
a strategy for action .
the main aim behind " the health of the nation " is simple : to improve the health of people living in england .
the question is how and where do we begin ?
if we don ' t , we wo n ' t achieve the success we want .
so we must :
concentrate on the major health problems .
focus on promoting good health and preventing disease as much as on care and treatment .
concentrating on problems
it is in these areas where national targets are being set .
the five key areas are :
coronary heart disease and stroke ;
mental illness ;
are major causes of serious illness or early death ;
offer scope for effective action .
the caps in the kullu , sirmaur , kinnaur and lahaul regions are also similarly embroidered .
this work is done traditionally by the farahada and the chhiba people .
the tribal folk use these fabrics mostly .
to the common folk watching plays is part of a religious ritual .
nowadays people also use kerosene oil lanterns and petromax lamps frequently .
the folk artists usually belong to the lower middle classes , and castes like sanhai , sehsi , cobblers , weavers and jheers .
for make - up the artists use wigs , kohl powder and costume jewellery .
after the deity , ganesha , has been worshipped , ballads depicting incidents from the scriptures and local history , are sung .
the chief devotee , chela , of shiva dances in a trance and answers questions that are put to him .
going to these shrines prior to entering the new house is supposed to bring great good luck to a newly married couple .
the demon ( rakshasa ) dance or chhambha these dances from the kinnaur area are reminiscent of the prehistoric period .
during local festivals like chaitol and bishu also , community dancing can often be seen .
the dalshone and cholamba dances these dances belong to the ropa valley and in these the patterns formed by the dancers look like coiled serpants .
the nagas kayang is a dance which copies the movement of a snake .
this depicts scenes from life in the village as also the forest .
at places the ghure has to deposit a small fee at the temple of the deity , for using the chamar .
the young and the aged , the rich and the poor all may join the ranks of the dancers ' in this , and dance together .
the women wear heavy armlets , and silver and gold ornaments known as tunki and chanki around their necks .
each line ends with hoo hoo sounds .
the gi dance is performed to an intricate beat of three divisions .
of these lahadi is a popular one .
in this , the women form two teams which stand face to face .
the first two or three dancers sing the song and the rest repeat the lines .
this dance places a lot of importance on physical movement .
the girls hold hands crosswise and rotate fast on their toes , singing songs .
syllables like oo , aa , form the ' tek ' or the note which is prolonged at the end of the line .
these syllables help the singers establish a certain resonance and a definite rhythmic pattern .
the process by which these pre - cambrian ancestral forms led to their myriad descendants of today is called organic evolution .
it could not possibly do so because the mechanism of heredity was not yet known .
biologists have given both the sex cells , the egg and sperm , a common neutral name , gamete .
fertilisation then is the fusion of two gametes , one from each parent , into a single cell called zygote .
it is the zygote that grows during gestation into embryo , foetus and a new born infant .
such growth occurs by continued proliferation of a single cell into myriad others .
thus the fertilised human egg which at conception is a single cell becomes at birth an ensemble of billions of cells .
gurdon thus showed the way to produce thousands of genetically identical offsprings in the laboratory , at least in frogs .
contrary to what one might expect , the frog egg is huge compared to the microscopic human ovum .
the reason is obvious .
the frog egg is like a chicken egg in that it must carry all the nutrient to support the complete development of the embryo .
the size of human ova , therefore , is incredibly small considering the size of the offspring .
it was a case of pure science fantasy masquerading as a scientific fact .
since cloning of higher animals is still not possible , all that can be done is to control their genotypic variation by other means .
most cultivated wheats , oats , barleys , beans , peas , etc . reproduce chiefly by self - fertilisation .
the truth about heredity dwelt in the deeps and mendel was the first to see it .
having seen it , he proceeded to demonstrate it by designing appropriate breeding experiments to verify the bold hypothesis he had made .
these two laws of mendel are the basis of modern genetics .
consider , for the sake of definiteness , mendel ' s experiment with tall and short pea plants already cited .
let us call the variant or allele that produces tallness y and the allele for shortness y .
now the parent with genotype yy produces gametes carrying only y , and , the other parent with genotype yy , gametes carrying only y .
and short , are in the ratio 3 : 1 , since the two genotypes yy and yy have the same phenotype , tall .
although the phenotype of the genotypes yy and yy is the same , genetically they are quite distinct .
a case in point is the gene that determines the coat colour of guinea pigs .
it has two alleles which we may denote by the symbols y and y .
the homozygotes yy have coat colour white , while homozygotes yy are yellow .
but there will be only two phenotypes , round or wrinkled , in the usual 3 : 1 ratio .
however , the segregation of r genes will occur quite independently of the segregation of y genes considered earlier .
the upshot is rather a mathematical melange of two 3 : 1 ratios .
since tallness and roundness are the dominant traits , the double homozygote dominant yyrr is a tall plant with round seeds .
such plants produce gametes possessing one member of each allele pair .
consider now a mating in which the partners are similar to this fl generation .
the older brother is considered equal to the father .
the birth of a son is a great occasion in the villages .
this is only a stray illustration of the vast amount of work that has been done on linkage in a number of organisms , notably banana fly and maize .
echinus ( rough eyes ) sis in the form of linkage tests . such a map is known as a cytogenic map .
some map for comparison . the figure indicates only the first four genes for purposes of illustra -
it will be seen that the order of the genes is the same in both the maps .
in short , punctuated genes serve as vital an evolutionary role as sexual reproduction .
the latter permits an enormously greater variety of genotypes or genetical moulds than would be possible otherwise .
but punctuated genes of higher animals and plants are not the only additional complexity .
there are further complications due to diverse interrelationships between these levels .
the probability of their occurrence increases .
the law of evolution is a kind of converse of the second law of thermodynamics , equally irreversible but contrary in tendency .
we are reminded of the two components of empedocles ' world friendship , union , attraction ; andstrife , dispersion , repulsion . "
thus the baldness gene can be inherited equally by a man or woman .
but it does not act in the same way in both .
they are the deviants whose effect on development varies with the individual carrying them .
in other words , a given genotype need not necessarily always give rise to a constant phenotype .
it happens that the glandular make - up of the two sexes governs the way the gene expresses itself .
some remarkable evidence to support this surmise has been given in studies and experiments by dr james b . hamilton .
this is why a male that carries a single dose of a recessive sex - linked gene shows its effect in the pheno - type .
but the y chromosome , which as we noted earlier , ' is a dummy , is not entirely empty of genes .
first , there is the short segment marked ab which contains homologous alleles in both x and y chromosomes .
next follows the still shorter section be of the y chromosome containing material that has no counterpart or alleles in the parallel section of the x chromosome .
first , the genes in this region can be crossed over between the two chromosomes as in auto - somes .
second , they possess alleles in both sexes instead of only in the female .
these differences may be illustrated by a few examples .
actually , however , they may carry the guilty gene either in the x or y chromosome .
in the latter event , the reverse would be true .
illegitimate children , or children born of a widow or an unmarried girls have no property rights .
this custom is nearly obsolete now .
the new technique is an experimental substitute for sexual breeding .
such somatic ( body ) - cell hybridisation experiments have been performed by taking cells from two specieshuman fibro - blasts ( connective tissue cells ) and mouse cells .
thus out of 40 mouse and 46 human chromosomes the fused hybrids consist of 41 to 55 chromosomes instead of the combined to tail of 86 .
of the 41 to 55 chromosomes , 40 of mouse are present , the remaining 1 to 15 being human .
heredity was merely a consequence of the passage of ' blood ' the blended blood of both parentsto the progeny .
we now know better .
for it is not blood that passes from parent to progeny but packets of genes wrapped in chromosomes .
it is so huge that many of these possible combinations like the possible genotypes have not even existed on earth .
in case of complications , the village assembly of pachi ( panchayat ) is called .
the gaddis perform the marriage ceremony twice .
in some villages the couple must break a sal leaf into two in the presence of fellow - villagers .
in case of a divorce the woman forfeits all rights to the husband ' s property .
his head must point to the north and as soon as death occurs , conch shells are blown . .
this lamp symbolises the dead man .
this ' virgin soil ' influenza actually killed more people in shorter time than the war itself during its four - year long duration .
they , therefore , suggest that we should exercise abundant caution very like what lawyers do in law suits .
moreover , the dangers of these techniques are not confined solely to the possibility of individual physiological harm .
as a silent weapon in biological warfare , newly created pathogenic bugs may be cheaper to use and easier to exploit .
indeed , the whole , issue of genetic engineering in plants and animals raises other questions that science alone cannot resolve . the un -
doubted scientific benefits that the techniques will bring will have to be measured against the moral and ethical problems that follow in their wake .
for these and other reasons , a number of scientists themselves called for certain restrictions on certain types of genetic experiments .
recombinant dna carrying a gene for human alpha interferon is inserted in the cells of bacteria e . coli .
these bacteria proliferate synthesising the human protein alpha interferon along with thousands of their own .
when bacterial cells reach maximum concentration , they are killed and discharged from the fermentation tanks for concentration by centrifugation .
for we are no longer limited to the set of natural interferons .
we can now break up interferon genes and splice the pieces to make new genes to tailor interferon molecules to particular effects .
this is a truth which still fills us with astonishment . "
they have come a long way , these replicators .
children arising from unions not sanctioned by the state were to be considered illegitimate .
breeding mothers were to be between 20 and 40 and impregnating fathers between 25 and 55 .
outside these ages , intercourse was permissible but abortion or infanticide was compulsory if it led to pregnancy .
insanity is a case in point .
for , the less its frequency in the original population the more difficult its elimination by sterilisation or selection .
now , the human race has a great many defective genes , but , for the most part , any one kind has a very low frequency .
consequently selection against any particular defective gene is an extremely slow process .
within the area reached by direct ionising radiation , great amounts of radioactivity are induced .
most individuals who are near enough to receive a total radiation of about 450 roentgens do not survive .
but those who are further away are not entirely safe .
for seven weeks , the lama comes to the dead man ' s house to recite the sacred text ( chhos ) .
at the end of the seven week period , the lama and jomo read the text together and are then fed by the family of the dead man .
on the day of the death , the lama tells them about life after death and about re -
if an old man dies , till the lama arrives at the house , no one may touch the dead body .
it is only the crystalline structures that are able to replicate themselves in a somewhat analogous way .
it is writ large in its subsequent evolution from its probable origin in some ' subvital ' antocatalytic molecule of protein all the way to man .
it accounts for the fact already noted that chemical machinery of the cell is essentially the same both in its structure and its functioning .
consider first the cell structure .
it is , no doubt , true that this central theme of metabolism has many variations , each corresponding to a particular .
but they almost always consist in minor departures from universal metabolic sequences .
for example , the birds and mammals excrete nitrogen in different ways : the former excrete uric acid , the latter urea .
there is evidence that even much simpler organisms such as worms have this faculty .
it is the foundation on which are based more and more sophisticated usages of language in higher levels of symbolic and abstract thought .
the heart is a strong muscular pump whose function is to pump blood to reach every part of the body from head to foot .
location , weight and structure it is located slightly to the left of the centre of the chest between the chest bones and the spine .
the weight of the heart of an adult is 200 - 350 gms ( men250 - 350 gms ; women200 - 300 gms ) .
fig . 1 : external appearance of the heart .
internally it consists of four chambers , two above and two below .
the upper chamber is the atrium and the lower the ventricle .
it has a thin inner lining which is in contact with blood and is called endocardium .
there are valves between the chambers which open and close to regulate the flow of blood only in one direction .
veins , small and big , bring blue or impure blood back to the heart for purification .
the liver processes nutrients and together with kidneys purifies the blood .
there are two phases in the action of the heart .
the first is contraction or systole when blood is pumped out .
the second is a very brief period of rest or relaxation diastole .
there is a pulse for each beat of the heart which is a combination of one systole and diastole .
for an adult , the normal pulse rate is 60 - 90 per minute or in other words , about 85,000 beats per day .
in children the rate is 100 - 120 per minute or about 140,000 per day .
the quantity of blood pumped during each heart beat is about 70 ml .
the heart will beat faster than normal when you get very excited or frightened or while exercising very strenuously .
the circulation blood goes out from the heart through the arteries and returns to it through the veins .
blood circulates through the network of arteries and veins .
the quantity of blood normally present in the body is 6 - 7 litres .
it takes 60 - 90 seconds for the outgoing blood to return to the heart .
air is pumped into the cuff using the rubber ball .
when sufficient air has been pumped into the cuff it will press the artery and will stop the flow of the blood in the artery .
the pressure is gradually released and the person taking blood pressure measurement in the gauge will listen through the stethoscope for the sound of the pulse in the artery .
this is the systolic pressure .
it is the pressure when the heart is contracting or is in the pumping phase .
a second reading will be taken by releasing more air till the sound disappears .
this is called diastolic pressure or pressure when the heart is relaxing .
till recently these changes were considered to be the effect of degeneracy of various body functions due to aging .
special cardiovascular tests these fall under two categories :
non - invasive tests such as a treadmill , 2 - d echocardi - ography ( with doppler ) , ambulatory monitoring and radio isotope studies .
newer tests are cardiovascular ultrasound , angioscopy , doppler coronary flow .
this trend is already apparent in india .
alent in about three children per 1,000 , between five and 15 years of age .
high blood pressure high blood pressure produces a four times greater risk of heart attack .
as this condition may be completely asymptomatic , it is called a silent killer .
the only way to find out whether one has high blood pressure is by having the pressure measured .
high cholesterol level cholesterol is essential to life but excess of cholesterol and fats in the blood contribute to clogging of the arteries , which results in heart attacks .
the higher the level of cholesterol in the blood , the higher the risk of heart attack .
diet influences serum cholesterol levels to a large extent .
a family history of heart attacks or high blood pressure increases the risk .
this is essentially a cry of the heart for blood .
it usually occurs during physical exertion , after emotional upset or after a heavy meal .
relief comes with rest or by a tablet under the tongue .
the heart muscle recovers from the temporary oxygen shortage before damage to it occurs .
people who feel angina pain should consult a doctor .
sometimes angina may occur at rest or during sleep .
this is a more serious condition .
this means that a portion of the heart muscle actually dies due to sudden but prolonged oxygen shortage .
factors increasing the chance of thrombosis are rhythm disturbances , a sluggish blood flow , tobacco smoking , stress and contraceptive pills when taken by women who smoke .
factors decreasing the chance are low serum cholesterol levels , aspirin , dietary factors , such as , poly unsaturated fats and regular exercise .
heart beat disturbances whenever the heart muscle is impaired by an oxygen shortage , its electrical system may be upset .
extra heart beats and non - rhythmic muscle contractions interfere with pumping efficiency of the heart .
these arrhythmias can be serious .
treatment anybody experiencing symptoms of angina or any rhythm disturbance should consult a physician for a thorough check - up .
immediate treatment is rest and requisitioning the services of a physician as soon as possible .
when the crop is ready for harvesting , a black goat is led around the fields and sacrificed .
the meat of the goat is then distributed in the village as a holy ' prasad ' of the gods .
sometimes to propitiate yakshas , saints , goddesses or family gods , people perform a jatra .
at the time of harvesting , feasts are offered to the daitits especially to baba .
the pomogrenate tree is worshipped at the time of a wedding .
friendships are also formed beneath this tree by formally appointing the tree as the witness .
in some areas the customs for welcoming a guest are some - what strange .
the guest lets himself in and finds a seat .
in a little while the host family files in , and welcomes him .
the relatives cook many delicacies at this time and send it for the bride and the groom .
in baishakhi the sooi jataras take place at the temple of naina davi .
another beautiful fair takes place on the banks of the rival - sar lake on the baisakhi day .
according to a traditional tale , the rishi lomash had offered his prayer at this spot to lord shiva , the fair is held in memory of the rishi .
the village folk who come to the fair take a dip in the lake which is considered as holy as the river ganges .
( the account of the war between the kauravas and pandus is as follows : )
if they did not keep this engagement they would be bound to return into banishment for a like number of years .
each party tried to gain vasudeva as ally , whereupon he offered either himself or his brother balabhadra together with an army .
but the children of pandu preferred him .
they were five menyudhishthira , their leader , arjuna , the bravest of them , sahadeva , bhimasena , and nakula .
they had seven akshauhim , whilst their enemies were much stronger .
but now they conquered ; all those hosts were destroyed , and none remained except the five brothers .
thereafter vasudeva returned to his residence and died , together with his family , who were called yadava .
also the five brothers died before the year had reached its end , at the end of those wars .
the rishi , annoyed at thus being jeered at , said the thing in his belly would cause . his , and his clansmen ' s , death .
vasudeva who knew that the curse would come true got the pan filed and thrown in a river .
all these orders and divisions are necessary for the preparation for battle , for pitching camp and breaking up camp .
an akihavhim has 21,870 chariots , 21,870 elephants , 65,610 riders , 109,350 footmen .
accordingly the number of people who ride on chariots and elephants is 284,323 ( mc ) .
the number of those who ride on horses is 87,480 .

between sri harsha and vikramaditya there is an interval of 400 years , as i have been told by some of the inhabitants of that region .
however . in the kashmirian calendar i have read that sri harsha was 664 years later than vikramaditya .
in face of this discrepancy i am in perfect uncertainty , which to the present moment has not yet been cleared up by any trustworthy information .
those who use the era of vikramaditya live in the southern and western parts of india .
the epoch of the era of saka or sakakala falls 135 years later than that of vikramaditya .
he interdicted the hindus from considering and representing themselves as anything but sakas .
they honour the conqueror by adding sri to his name , so as to say sri vikramaditya .
the remainder is the year of the valabha era .
the hindus pronounce the d of this word something between a d and an r .
if the word in this garb wanders back to the hindus , they will not recognise it . . . .
the hindus call the year in which a month is repeated in the common language malamasa .
mala means the dirt that clings to the hand .
however , in the literature the leap month is called adhimasa .
that month is repeated within which ( it being considered as a solar month ) two lunar months finish .
the sum represents the savanahargana , i . e . the sum of the partial solar days . ' you write down the number in two places .
in the one place you multiply it by 5311 , i . e . the number which represents the universal adhimasa months .
this is the traditional view of the hindus . . . .
( quotes the vayu - purana regarding the shape of the sun , its neat , light , etc .
ah the stars are called tarn , which word is derived from tarana , i . e . the passage .
the idea is that those saints have passed through the wicked world and have reached bliss , and that the stars pass through heaven in a circular motion .
twelve equal parts , so , by the lunar stations , it is divided into twenty - seven equal parts .
each station occupies 13 / degrees , or 800 minutes of the ecliptic .
the planets enter into them and leave them again , and wander to and fro through their northern and southern latitudes .
however , the arabs are illiterate people , who can neither write nor reckon .
they only rely upon numbers and eyesight .
they have no other medium of research than eyesight , and are not able to determine the lunar stations without the fixed stars in them .
they call the degrees of a star ' s distance from the sun which are thought necessary for its heliacal rising kalamsaka .

these gods and two goddesses enter the city a day before shivaratri with a band of people playing on various musical instruments .
the fairs in the kullu valley follow their own patterns , some of which point at local customs and influences .
on the 3rd bhadrapada is the festival harbali ( ? ) , for the women .
they throw roses and perfumes on them and play with each other during the whole night .

patanjali ( patanjala ? ) ( p . 6 ) .
at two other places , the word batanjal , however , indicates the name of the author ( p . 37 ) .
sachau , therefore suggests that the name of the author was probably taken to indicate the title of his book too .
he therefore wrote it as patanjali , as written in sanskrit generally .
it may be noted that he calls it a part of the bharata , and does not mention the title mahabharata .
sachau draws attention to the differences in the text used by al - biruni and the present bhagwad gita .
sachau also suggests that al - biruni was probably using a commentary , not the text of the gita .

the figures made by tattooing range from one ' s name , to birds and flowers and figures of goods and goddesses .
the loves , joys , sorrows and hopes of the people are reflected in this art form , through traditional symbolic patterns .
after this manasukha or dandoo comes on the stage and introduces the theme of the play to the people and sets it going .
each hillside and valley in the state of himachal has some festival or jatara almost throughout the year .
these shows are also known locally as jhankls or dole ( floats ) .
for a month these shows are enacted in various villages by travelling troupes of performers , who are presented with gifts of food and money by the villagers .
two young boys carry peacock feathers at the head of the processions and dance to the beat of the drums assuming warrior like postures .
in this the women dress up as men and act out many incidents and comic skits based on common incidents of demostic life .
each village has its own troupe of ramleela actors who perform it each year for a total period of fourteen years .
people travel long distances to come and see these .
kangra is well known for its wrestling matches to see which people come from far away villages .
it is a tribal dance which is performed at the completion of the harvesting ldr .
nati several forms of this dance are prevelent in the kullu , sirmaur , mandi , mahasu and chamba areas .
rhythm is a main feature of this dance , and often it drives its name from the particular rhythm it employs .
the instruments that accompany this dance range from drums , shehnai ( a wind instrument ) , cymbals and ranasinga ( an instrument similar to a trombone ) .
the shehnai played by the hesis is the life of the nati dance .
in this the dancers hold aloft weapon like bows , arrows , knives or sticks and yell to as they move towards their imaginary adversaries .
in the rasa dance , the dancers step back and forth and sit the leap up alternatively as they dance .
this dance form is symbolic of the unity of the peoples .
this is a free dance which copies the gestures of animals .
dancing in circles , suddenly lying down on the grounds and striking various poses , are some of the chief features of these dances .
these are danced with great fervour .
' the dussera season in kullu is the time to witness these .
khaydayat and lamba dances in these dance forms , the dancers hold a sword in one hand and a scabbard in another , and dance in a circle .
each piece has four lines and the last syllable in the first line is pronounced in a drownout fashion like .
in laman and jhoori the ' aa ' ending helps both lines to rhyme .
in the kinnaur , lahaul , pangi , sirmaur and kullu areas , drums of different shapes and sizes are played at different festivals .
before they are played upon , during a festival incense , flowers , turmeric paste and rice is offered unto them and prayers are chanted .
in the plains , apart from this regular drums , large drums known as ' tamaka ' are played at fairs .
playing upon these , signals is the beginning of a fair or a festival .
among the gaddis small round drums known as ' dafale ' are played at weddings .
these drums are made with locally available meterial .
even so when the folk singers , dressed in their traditional finery , begin to perform , a whole way of life comes alive once again .
thus if genes are atoms of heredity , chromosomes are its macro molecules .
the study of heredity is , therefore , the study of genes and chromosomes .
the number ( n ) of chromosome pairs varies widely from species to species .
these ' instructions ' are embodied in the genes and chromosomes in a code we have yet to decipher fully .
chromosomes and genes are thus in a manner of speaking microminiaturised ' tapes ' of heredity , the software of heredity that activates the computer hardware of environment .
the computer analogy is not as far - fetched as it may seem at first sight .
the 46 chromosomes in each somatic or body cell contain the same information as was in the initial zygote .
but during the early 1960s professor f . c . steward devised , a novel way of growing garden carrot plant .
he used differentiated cells instead of seeds ; yet amazingly these cells from carrot root when exposed to various nutritive media began to proliferate .
eventually , with patience and changing media and techniques , steward managed to coax the individual root cells to form clumps , and organised masses .
he finally succeeded in carrying one individual cell to the ultimate stage of a complete carrot plant , roots , stalks , leaves , flowers , seeds and all .
plants , however , are not animals .
having in this way duplicated themselves , the old chromosomes separate from their newly - formed duplicates when the parent cell divides subsequently in two .
consequently the nucleus would be doubled in size in each generation .
and it is because of mitosis that the body cell retains intact its genetic patrimony in all the successors it breeds by division .
consequently both the basic processes of cell division ( mitosis ) and cell reduction ( meiosis ) are fundamental in almost all biological reproductions .
such delinking has already occurred in the current vogue of artificial insemination that has revolutionised cattle breeding .
as is well known , artificial insemination has become virtually standard practice in dairy cattle breeding in the last 30 years or so .
it can therefore be distributed for use far and wide .
for , means have now been evolved to stimulate within the female multiple release of mature eggs with the aid of a pituitary hormone .
these eggs can be collected , fertilised , and transplanted to genetically less endowed foster mothers .
now the modern objective in breeding cattle is to increase the total yield of milk and butter fat for each lactation period .
first , how to let people enjoy sex without reproduction .
for some enthusiasitic geneticists have seized on the potentialities of human artificial insemination to dream of breeding supermen of the future .
they may , therefore , be of the same sex as the biblical twins eeau and jacob or of opposite sexes like apollo and artemis of greek mythology .
nevertheless , an overfed genetical dwarf may grow bigger and fatter than a starved sibling with normal genes .
these are not merely forms of address but are also looked upon as precious relationships among individuals and in the community .
when going to a fair , a wedding or travelling together to holy places , such relationships are often established .
a woman may choose &amp; man as her brother , and then they are known as mitra and mitrani .
the older uncles are also highly respected and at the time of a wedding , they are especially honoured with gifts of pink turbans .
the conditions that lead to the emergence of a mental trait are , on the other hand , ex - tremely numerous as well as remote .
they come into play during the entire life of an individual and appear in the most diversified forms in his environment .
this is why the question , which is more important , heredity or environment , is a pseuodo problem .
the inherited gene complex or genetical mould of an organism is called its genotype .
such a technique was invented by john gurdon .
we shall revert to the question of inbreeding and pure lines in chap . 9 .
on the other hand , the differences in plants in the same horizontal row represent responses of the same genotype to different environments .
aunts , uncles , cousins are all considered equal to one ' s own parents , and brothers and sisters , are loved and respected as such .
at the time of settling a match , the rajputs and the brahmins lay particular stress on the purity of race , caste , gotra and family .
very often their marital connections extend upto chamba , punjab and jammu .
among the higher castes , the daughter ' s father ' s house ( maika ) enjoys a great importance .
it is also taboo for the girl ' s family members to eat or drink anything in her sasural .
to approach the elders with a head bared , is considered inauspicious .
mendel performed his celebrated experiments by growing a variety of peas in his monastery garden nearly a century ago .
he , therefore , concluded that when parents differ in character , the offsprings resemble one parent but not the other .
this is not to say that the dominant trait suppresses completely its submissive or recessive counterpart .
in other words , the short trait reappeared in the second generation having remained dormant in the first .
this led him to formulate his first law of heredity called the law of segregation .
he found that each pair of contrasting characters shows dominance and segregation independently of the others .
this is mendel ' s second law of independent assortment .
there is clearly no other combination possible .
these proportions or relative frequencies are called genotype frequencies .
there are , therefore , four possibilities in all as follows :
further , if the mating in the population is random , all these four possibilities are equiprobable .
it will also be observed that while the genotypes yy and yy are different , their corresponding phenotypes are the same .
but both types will now be tall since every genotype contains the dominant allele y ( fig . 16 ) .
the individuals produced by a back - cross constitute what is known as an r2 generation .
the mating of the hybrids rr will , as before , produce three genetical types rr , rr , rr in the ratio 1 : 2 : 1 .
each partner will give rise to four kinds of gametes , carrying yr , yr , yr , yr , in equal numbers .
three possess rr and at least one y so that they are tall plants with wrinkled seeds .
that is , the four possible combinations of the traits appear in the ratio 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 .
fig . 17 also shows the form of segregation which would ensue in the absence of dominance .
all the genetically distinct classes would then have been separable .
also the double recessive homozygote yyrr , producing short plants with wrinkled seeds , can produce only one type of gamete yr .
for this purpose we have considered only the simplest situations when only one or two pairs of alleles are segregating .
but the second law applies equally when three or higher numbers of allele pairs are involved .
as a result the dominants and recessives seem to be repelled from each other .
nevertheless , the linkage between genes located on the same chromosome is not absolute .
a specific example will explain more clearly the notion of crossover .
in general , the number of linked groups of an organism equals the number of pairs of homologous chromosomes in its cells .
an important offshoot of linkage theory is that the degree or strength of linkage depends upon the distance between the linked genes in the chromosome .
obviously the further apart the two linked genes are in the chromosome , the more likely would they be to crossover .
such knowledge is , no doubt , necessary for a proper understanding of the mechanism of heredity as a prelude to its control by genetic manipulation .
we shall deal with such genetic transformations of one strain of bacteria into another more fully in chap . 12 .
first being single - celled there is no separation between soma ( body ) and germ plasm in the case of the former .
at the time of childbirth , the mother is housed in a separate room .
in the tribal areas she is often lodged in a cattle - manor ' ( khudd ) .
in fact , we cannot gain anything for nothing , not even an observation as g . gabor has recently reminded us .
what then is the fallacy in maxwell ' s reasoning ?
nothing is easier than to dodge maxwell ' s paradox by affirming the prima facie impossibility of such beings .
the mystery of life processes arises not because chemical reactions within living organisms are fundamentally different from those occurring in the laboratory ; quite the contrary .
dna , as also its chemical ally rna ( ribonucleic acid ) is , as the name implies , a species of nucleic acid .
thus the tiny living cell is an extraordinarily intricate automatic chemical computer .
all such analogies no matter how rough and remote do have a degree of similitude that illuminates an aspect of their working .
this gives two ways of picking a black card .
this is why x and y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes .
the remaining 22 ' regular ' chromosomes are called autosomes .
children born in the gandhmool hour are considered unlucky , and are often gifted away ritually as soon as they are born .
hereditary laws the laws of heredity differ from area to area : .
the idea of chromosomal map of man is not as farfetched as it may seem at first sight .
nevertheless , a beginning has been made in constructing a linkage map of the two sex - chromosomesx and yof man .
being linked with sex the resultant phenotypes are more easily recognised .
let c and c be two alleles or variants of the gene concerned with colour blindness .
a colour - blind daughter will be produced only if a colour - blind man happens to marry a colour - blind woman or a carrier .
this haemophilia manifests itself chiefly in failure of the blood to clot when exposed to air .
in normal persons such clotting limits the bleeding from wounds and thus prevents excessive and possibly fatal haemorrhages .
the individuals inheriting the sclerotic gene have unusually thin outer wall on the eye which , therefore , has a bluish tinge instead of the white sclerotic of normals .
the eye condition itself is harmless but it is often associated with serious defects in other parts of the body .
another time , when he took his fiancee on his lap , his thigh bone broke . "
the gene effect on the fragility of the bone is not the same in all individuals .
in one country only 63 per cent of the individuals inheriting the blue sclerotic gene showed its effect as fractures of the bones .
finally , there is the greater part of the x chromosome which stretches from c to d alone .
the total non - homologous section of x chromosome is therefore be + cd = bd .
they are known as totally sex - linked genes .
since this portion of the human y chromosome is very short , it must carry relatively extremely few genes .
it is , therefore , no surprise that only two or three such geines have so far been detected .
if so , the guilty gene could not be located in y chromosome .
consequently partial sex - linkage differs from total sex - linkage in two ways .
there are many other pathological defects which are now known to arise in a similar way .
for only homologous genes located in this portion can possibly cross over from one to another and thus permit detection and measurement of linkage between them .
unfortunately , such a linkage between phenotype and genotype is riddled with many difficulties in the case of man .
assaying a number of clones for various enzymes , therefore , provides information whether or not they belong to the same chromosome .
the skin colour may be white , black , yellow , brown , mulatto , or copper coloured .
but blood types are almost as numerous as the number of possible genotypes .
it may be r positive , kell negative , duffy positive , and so on with regard to yet other factors .
the controlling genes of each system produce the characteristic antigen present in the red blood cells .
the immunisation in turn gives rise to anti - rh antibodies in mother ' s bloodstream .
the clumping reaction between antibodies of the mother and the red cells of her unborn child provokes anaemia .
this may be serious enough to cause the death of the newborn infant or abortion of the foetus ( fig . 37 ) .
altogether , it has been estimated that about 6 per cent of all fertilised eggs die before birth owing to the effects of this single gene locus .
in such cases there could be antibodies already present in sufficient strength at her very first rh pregnancy to attack the child .
for repeated transfusions of rh positive blood in a negative person of either sex may eventually produce serious adverse reactions .
hence , even men with rh negative blood should not be given rh positive blood transfusions .
when they do , the upshot is a hereditary disease to which both sexes are more or less equally prone .
that such defective genes sometimes do occur in chromosomes is not surprising .
the duplicate genes so produced are quite stable and durable .
such abnormality is confined only to sex chromosomes and one of the smallest autosomes .
but there are several anomalous conditions in which x and y chromosomes are in abnormal conditions such as xo , xxx , xyy , xxy .
a comparison of these patterns with the normal combinations xy or xx will show what might be expected .
thus when y is absent , the resultant individual xo is an apparent female anatomically but remains sexually immature and sterile .
at the same time their mental and physical powers deteriorate leading inexorably to death before or during adolescence .
a dominant mutation expresses itself in the first generation that receives it .
we still do not know precisely what specific malfunctioning of the aberrant gene ( a ) causes them .
similar metabolic pathways in higher organisms have been shown to be controlled by specific genes .
this disease , like phenylketonuria , is inherited as a recessive .
for individuals with this mutation , milk is a toxic substance because glactose accumulates in tissues when lactose is ingested .
the accumulation of glactose gives rise to a number of clinical effects , like enlargement of liver , development of cataract and loss of weight by the patient .
but the effect of other mutations like pku seem more difficult to control .
at first sight , it may seem as simple to deal with pku as with the incapacity to digest milk .
all we need do is to feed the infant from birth a diet which has a minimal amount of phenylalanine .
there are available digests of milk protein from which most of phenylalanine is chemically removed .
but treated cases do not seem to escape damage of one sort or another .
there is now reason to believe that the level of phenylalanine which can be tolerated in the blood is highly critical .
if one ' s meat is another ' s poison , it is the quantities of phenylalanine that a pku baby can tolerate .
the day the bride enters the new household , a special havan ( byah luad ) is performed , under the guidance of the family priest .
some are much bigger or more useful to man than others .
this basic feature of heredity likeness tinged with fringe variation has been used for breeding before the dawn of history .
for deliberate breeding must have started with the very dawn of agriculture and animal husbandry .
other old carvings show cross - pollination of date palms .
a case in point is the production of a new variety of rabbit called rex .
in this case the first generation hybrids are neither rex nor white but some of the second generation combine both characters .
this method has been used very extensively in wheat breeding .
cuttings from that tree are ripening their fruit in new zealand and australia even today .
an experienced breeder will see points in a cow or a rose which a purely theoretical geneticist would miss completely .
what then is the influence of inbreeding on the quality of progeny ?
the evidence seemed to be highly equivocal and great confusion of ideas existed on the subject of inbreeding .
this is specially true if inbreeding is continued generation after generation .
it consists in selecting several superior looking varieties from a large number of genetically different land varieties .
corn is a case in point .
the price of this progress is increasing specialisation in the production of hybrid seed .
the halved chromo - somes grow to full size , resulting in two cells ,
all the unreduced cells in the flower would thus be tetraploid .
it is , therefore , p + ( 2pq ) = p ( p + q ) = p as p + q = 1 .
let us assume for the sake of simplicity that only one genotype yy is discriminated against .
then the initial genotype frequencies or probabilities as well as their fitness to breed the next generation will be :
in the long run , therefore , all that medical science has accomplished is to increase the prevalence of the disorder .
there seems no way out of the medical dilemma of our time to which we have already alluded in chap . 8 .
mathematical theory of organic evolution has thus had the imprimatur of experimental confirmation .
the natural selection is no longer deemed to be relentless war .
as t . dobzhansky has remarked , " natural selection is neither egotistic nor altruistic .
it is , rather , opportunistic ; life is promoted now by struggle and now by mutual help . "
a community may even oscillate between tender parental care and cannibalism of its offsprings according to requirements .
the means by which an automatic balance between births and deaths is achieved vary from one species to another .
infection then became the homeostatic mechanism to keep a balance btween human births and deaths .
it is self - evident that the only way to avert the chaos and catastrophe to which its absence is inexorably leading us is to segregate sex and reproduction .
he began it by plunging headlong into large - scale collectivisation and liquidating the more prosperous peasants who were condemned out of hand as kulak saboteurs .
as late as the thirties genetics was still a terra incognita .
for example , birds that need to rest on water in order to find their food stretch their feet when they wish to swim .
the skin becomes accustomed to being stretched and forms the web between the toes .
this animal , seeking to browse higher and higher on the leaves of trees on which it feeds stretches its neck .
the stretching continuing as a habit for a long time in all the individuals of the species led to the giraffe ' s lengthening its front limbs and neck .
as c . d . darlington remarked as late as 1955 , lamarckism is the ' evergreen superstition ' .
the wild canary was chosen some 300 years ago as a cage bird on account of its plumage alone .
it may have been as short as 200 generations or as long as 1,000 according to different estimates .
in russia wheat is sown in autumn .
if the wheat is not sown till spring , it gets a late start , and does not give a good crop .
even so the yields remained subnormal .
by resort to this vernalisation technique it became possible to grow wheat hundreds of miles further north than was possible before .
lysenko was credited with this discovery although it was an ancient practice and had been used elsewhere since the nineteenth century .
although this was a revival of lamarckism , lysenko ' s vernalisation and other similar proposals won him in 1935 the public support of stalin .
as lysenko ' s influence increased , he undertook to modify and redefine all biological theory .
some of his innovations were mere exercises in verbalism such as his doctrine of the phasic development of plants .
altering one stage in development by environmental means would cause successive stages to be changed .
this led him to deny the existence of genes and dismiss orthodox genetics as an aberration of capitalist science .
lysenko also claimed that he could produce new types of development cycles in plants by regulating the quality of their nutrients .
vatism ' of the plant and thus render it more sensitive to environmental changes .
he shattered this conservatism by using adverse environmental conditions , hybridisation and grafting .
it began to be retaught only in 1964 when he was stripped of his political authority after his protector khrushchev ' s fall in the same year .
this is done by a process known as transformation .
as a result genetic engineering research is now being freed from some of the more inhibiting restraints imposed by the guidelines .
it is likely that its subtleties will always remain beyond our ken .
the more we probe the molecular basis of life the deeper grows its mystery .
after the cremation , people bathe and come back to the deceased ' s house .
on the third day , the bones and ashes are immersed in a holy place like haridwar , rivalsar or mansarovar .
for ten days the house observes a mourning period .
during the next two decades genetic engineering will , therefore , be confined to the domestication of more and more bacteria for the benefit of man .
already it is possible to ' command ' the bacterium e . coli to produce the hormone , somatostatin .
it has now been established that the gene that produces it is located on the x chromosome .
further the gene has been isolated or cloned and a dna clone of factor viii produced .
the first essential step towards a new way of obtaining a pure product not contaminated with hepatitis and aids viruses has thus been taken .
by the end of the century a large variety of passenger vehicle or host vector systems will be developed for industrial use .
the same is true of genetic and environmental diseases .
some influences of both types may be hard to reverse , others may be easy .
some may be usually hard to reverse but easy if the right agent is applied .
the important point is that there is no general reason for expecting genetic influence to be any more irreversible than environmental ones . "
the first to provide philosophic support to these elitist practices of succession by heredity was plato .
his most important dialogue , the republic , was broadly concerned with the construction of an ideal commonwealth .
the whole village is then feasted .
in kinnaur when someone dies , all the villagers collect at his house at night .
two people then carry the body to the cremation grounds on a plank .
it is believed that if the legs are straight , an evil spirit might enter the body .
the lama ( priest ) then holds the head by the hair and recites prayer ( foa ) in his ears thrice .
he then seats himself at the head and explains to the spirit how it must leave the dead body .
dered auspicious if a drop of blood become visible on the fore -
he thus attributed a man ' s wordly success to his heredity alone , to the almost total exclusion of his environment .
it affected to a greater and lesser degree even the most progressive thinkers in the social and historic sciences .
there is little doubt that unlimited nuclear testing is a serious genetic hazard to future unborn generations .
throughout the ages he has been exposed to what is called natural background radiation .
it includes radiation from cosmic as well as terrestrial sources .
since the discovery of radioactivity , man has substantially added to his natural radiation burden .
the time horizon for attaining this level , however , is different for different types of genes .
but in course of time the new incidence of defectives , 20 per cent over the old , will eventually be attained .
in due course , perhaps , a reduction of even this putatively permissible limit of 10 rdentgens per 30 years may well become a categorical imperative .
nevertheless , the expectation is clearly contrary to the most obvious facts of life .
the english logician , a . m . turing was the first to resolve this conflict between actuality and anticipation .
an equal marvel at first sight is nature ' s departure from her normal practice of prodigal provision .
if nature ever tried another genetic code ( s ) , we have no evidence thereof .
there is perhaps a very good reason for nature ' s parsimony in making genetic codes .
but in the case of animals higher up the evolutionary scale , neonatal experience plays an important role in determining their behaviourial pattern .
nurture they thought is important .
as he has remarked , " human mind did not arise from some kind of rudimentary minds of molecules and atoms .
evolution is not simply unpacking of what was there in a hidden state from the beginning .
the lama recites prayers , the relatives cry and conch shells are blown .
two men , one with a couch shell and another with a flag , follow the funeral procession .

in addition it consists of vitamins and enzymes , etc .
action of the heart the right upper chamber ( right atrium ) receives venous or blue impure blood .
the right and left ventricles contract simultaneously to pump blood respectively to the lungs and to all parts of the body .
it is considered that this is a process which begins in childhood .
when this happens the heart will have to exert itself more than normal to pump blood to reach the extremities of the body .
sometimes a blood clot may completely block the flow of blood with severe consequences , i . e . a heart attack .
the more mature the clinician , the more expert will be his physical examination .
the blood pressure will have to be recorded , especially if the patient is on medication , in the lying , sitting and standing positions .
laboratory tests the doctor will decide as to which of the more elaborate tests are really necessary , considering the expense and labour involved .
simple tests , such as the ecg , x - ray , urine and blood tests are required for every patient .
certain other tests in the non - invasive and invasive categories will be decided on by the cardiologist concerned as they are more expensive than the routine tests .
a brief description of these tests is as follows :
certain other tests may be necessary for special cases .
these are the only types of heart disease which will be dealt with in the ensuing pages .
coronary heart disease coronary heart disease , also called atherosclerotic heart disease , is caused by clogging and narrowing of the coronary arteries whose functions have been described earlier .
a heart attack occurs if an artery becomes blocked and prevents blood from nourishing the heart muscle .
these are :
beedis contain more tobacco than cigarettes and are therefore more harmful .
the risk of sudden death from heart attacks in smokers is five times higher than in non - smokers .
in malana the god jamlu , and the god mahasu in dodra kwar , decide the cases through their devotees .
people who defy the caste laws are ostracised .
after this he offers a gift to the god .
often the local king is also given a gift ( shojir ) of money .
killing a cow is considered the biggest crime and sin .
age and sex the chance of heart disease increases with age in both sexes and in women after the change of life .
it is now believed that regular exercise strengthens the heart and improves the circulation .
it also helps to control high cholesterol , body weight , stress and blood pressure .
stress and behaviour patterns type a behaviour may be an important factor in heart attacks .
many of those prone to heart attacks are over - ambitious and easily excited .
prolonged anxiety and depression may also increase the risk of heart disease , as well as other ailments .
these are nutritional factors , such as plant foods and antioxidants , and metabolic factors , including new lipoprotein phenotypes , insulin resistance and homocysteine .
risk assessment tends to overlook people with numerous borderline abnormalities .
such people may be at a higher risk of chd than is indicated by this simple risk chart .
.45 1 and 2 from which you can know your risk points for a heart attack .
you may enjoy calculating your own risk from the charts .
symptoms of heart attack atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries may develop slowly to a point where complications occur without warning .
sudden death may occur and advanced diseases of the coronary arteries are the commonest cause of sudden death with or without warning symptoms .
when the heart contracts and fresh blood is pumped into the arteries , the pressure is at its peak and is called the systolic pressure .
subequently , when the heart relaxes and gets filled with fresh blood , the pressure is at its lowest and is called the diastolic pressure .
the body has a complex system by which the bp is regulated and controlled .
exercise the types of exercise and other aspects have been given under the heads elsewhere ( chapter 4 ) .
these customs are undergoing changes now .
the village moneylender usually takes advantage of the illiteracy of the villagers by charging them exorbitant interst rates .
the system of opening banks in villages by the government has improved the situation somewhat .
people cast votes to choose the members of this assembly .
fallow land around the village is known as shamlat .

it is much better to be a ' weight - watcher ' and for long - term weight control , a change in the pattern of eating is required .
add to this that the indian scribes are careless , and do not take pains to produce correct and well - collated copies .
this is also one of the reasons why a word has sometimes one meaning and sometimes another .
from all this it will appear that the metrical form of literary composition is one of the causes which make the study of sanskrit literature so particularly difficult .
on the contrary , all their fanaticism is directed against those who do not belong to them against all foreigners .
in order to illustrate this we shall produce some extracts from their literature , lest the reader should think that our account is nothing but hearsay .
this is the procedure followed by al - biruni in the subsequent chapters too .
the hindus differ among themselves as to the definition of what is action .
i , for my part , understand by the word a youth who is soft , i . e . pure .
this soft has become sufi , and in . this form the name of a class of thinkers , the sufi . "
similar views are also held by the sufi , because of the similarity of the dogma .
the animal is an animal as distinguished from a stone by virtue of its possession of the senses .
next follows the will , which directs the senses the exercise of their various functions , and which man as dwells in the heart .
we shall call them the necesyaria .
the doom a revolt by the subject of a particularly cruel or ruthless local rana or raja is known as ' doom ' .
therefore , he who does not believe in it does not belong to them , and is not reckoned as one of them .
however , these actions differ in the same measure as the three primary forces differ .
besides , the world is not left without some direction , being led , as it were , by a bridle and directed towards a definite scope .
therefore the imperishable souls wander about in perishable bodies conformably to the difference of their actions , as they prove to be good or bad .
people who hold this view do not know of another hell , but this kind of degradation below the degree of living as a human being .
in this manner it attains real knowledge and turns away from being arrayed in matter .
thereby action ceases , and both matter and soul become free by separating from each other .
they make a man similar to the wild beasts and the cattle , nay , even to the demons and devils .
thereby the second of the three primary forces is cut away .
by judicious selection and by preferring that which is better to that which is good , which way leads to a laudable end .
on the contrary , in the world of liberation all veils are lifted , all covers taken off , and obstacles removed .
or if you wish , say , it is the return of the soul as a knowing being into its own nature . " . . .
some sufi author relates the following story : " a company of sufi came down sufi parallels unto us , and sat down at some distance from us .
now i rose , went , to him and shook him but lo ! he was already cold . "
similar ideas of some greek writers such as ammonius , plato and proculus are referred to , pp . 83 - 86 . )
" the sage replied : there are three classes of them the spiritual ones in the height , men in the middle , and animals in the depth .
five species are those of the animals cattle , wild beasts , birds , creeping things , and growing things , i . e . the trees .
and , lastly , one species is represented by man . ' "
they specially belong to the hindus .
deva and this usage has been transmitted from magian times down to the persian language of our days .

rakshasa , demons of ugly and deformed shapes .
naga , beings in the shape of serpents .
the first force is peculiar to the deva , or angels who live in quietness and bliss .
therefore this number is one of his surnames , and his name itself ( mahadeva ) points in this direction .
the sum of the number of angels just mentioned would be 330,000,000 .
he may ascend to the degree of a rishi .
rishis are the sages who , though they are only human beings , excel the angels on account of their knowledge .
therefore , the angels learn from them , and above them there is none but brahman .
so the hule with all that is comprehended in it , is a bridge from above to below .
the second class the monks , the fire - priests , and the lawyers .
the third class the physicians , astronomers , and other men of science . the . fourth class the husbandmen and artisans .
and within these classes there were subdivisions , distinct from each other , like the species within a genus .
and forgetting is the necessary result of any long period of time , of a long succession of centuries and generations .
among the hindus institutions of this kind abound .
the next caste are the kshatriya , who were created , as they say , from the shoulders and hands of brahman . their degree not iii .
after them follow the vaisya , who were created from the thigh of brahman .
iv . the sudra , who were created from his feet .
between the latter two classes there is not very great distance .
these guilds live near the villages and towns of the four castes , but outside them .
the people called hadi , doma ( domba ) , candala , and badhatau ( sic ) are not reckoned amongst any caste or guild .
they are occupied with dirty work , like the cleansing of the villages and other services .
they ere considered as one sole class , and distinguished only by their occupations .
next follow the doma , who play on the lute and sing .
the still lower classes practise as a trade killing and the inflicting of judicial punishments .
the worst of all are the badhatau , who not only devour the flesh of dead animals , but everi of dogs and other beasts .
it has a similar handle to the sakti , but on each side it has two swords which join at the handle .
on his front place a third eye and make him ride on a white elephant with four tusks .
" the idol of kubera , the teasurer , wears a crown , has a big stomach and wide hips , and is riding on a man .
the " worshippers of these idols kill sheep and buffaloes with axes ( kutara ) , that they may nourish themselves with their blood .
there is hardly a single verse free from such and similar minatory injunctions .
as we have already mentioned , the books of the hindus are metrical compositions like the rajaz poems of the arabs .
continuing to do so till the end , you will have read the whole text twice .
it does not consist of the same compositions as the rig and yajur vedas , but of a third kind called bhara .
it is recited according to a melody with a nasal tone .
this veda is less in favour with the hindus than the others .
as to the puranas , we first mention that the word means first , eternal .
bmhma - purana , i . e . the nature charged with the preservation of the world . ' bhavishya - pumna , i . e . future things .
( 4 ) mokshadharma , on the reward of him who is liberated from the world .
asvamedha , i . e . the sacrifice of the horse which is sent out together with an army to wander through the world .
then they proclaim in public that it belongs to the king of the world , and that he who does not agree thereto is to come forward to fight .
the brahmans follow the horse , and celebrate sacrifices to the fire in those places where the horse drops its dung .
mausala , i . e . the fighting of the yadavas , the tribe of vasudeva , among themselves .
in this book there occur passages which , like riddles , admit of manifold interpretations .
at the same time vyasa made it obligatory on him to write only that which he understood .
and when the king disapproved of her doing so , she gave him an angry reply , and used coarse language towards him .
thereupon the sage went off to mahadeva , praying , praising , and fasting devoutly .
the god also promised to assist him in further development of this science .
then the sage returned to the king and taught it to him .
these names they have invented simply to facilitate the versification of their metrical books .
for this purpose they have invented so many names that one may fit into the metre if others will not .
the verse is divided into three , or more commonly into four pada .
sometimes they add a fifth pada in the middle of the verse .
this kind is called arya .
in the metre of 5 padas , the fifth pada is placed between padas 3 and 4 .
for they do not like all the verses of a long poem to belong to one and the same metre .
they use many metres in the same poem , in order that it should appear like an embroidered piece of silk .
( the difference between the arab and hindu method of the rotation of a pada is given . p . 144 . )
for the same reason the smallest number of the syllables of a pada is four , the largest twenty - six .
what we have of sciences is nothing but the scanty remains of bygone better times .
their belief about the cyclical revolutions of tunes is nothing very special , but is simply in accordance with the results . of scientific observation .
vasisktha - siddhanta , so called from one of the stars of the great bear , composed by vishnucandra .
romaka - siddhanta , so called from the rum , i . e . the subjects of the roman empire , composed by srishena .
the contents of the book kamna - khanda - khadyaka represent the doctrine of aryabhata .
therefore brahmagupta afterwards composed a second book , which he called uttara - khanda - khadyaka , i . e . the explanation of the khanda - khadyaka .
it explains , the reasons and the nature of the calculations employed in the khanda - khadyaka , i suppose it is a work of balabhadra .
this is the frontier of india from the north .
in the western frontier mountains of india there live various tribes of the afghans , ' and extend up to the neighbourhood of the sindh valley .
after the above - mentioned gulf follow the small munha , the great munha , then the bawarij , i . e . the pirates of kacch and somariath .
hence the coast - line comes to the country laran , in which lies tne city of jimur , then to vallabha , kanjt , darvad .
at all events , thus the matter stands according to popular belief .
in former times there were pearl - banks in the bay of sarandib ( ceylon ) , but at present they have been abandoned .
if he had known the truth , he might have spared himself the theory of the breaking of the egg .
( the views of several indian , writers brahmagupta , pulisa , balabhadra and aryabhattaare quoted , and criticised .
sukla - bhumi , the bright earth .
in the translation however , it has been rendered so as to express that it is not higher than himavant oy more than a yojana .
this author is not identical with the elder aryabhatta , but he belongs to his followers , for he quotes him and follows his example .
about the mountain itself they have many traditions .
some give it the height of one yojana , others more ; some consider it as quadrangular , others as an octagon .
we shall now lay before the reader what the rishis teach regarding this mountain . . . .
( it ) has seven mountains containing jewels , fruits , flowers , odoriferous plants and cereals . . .
kusa - dvipa has seven kingdoms and innumerable rivers flowing to the sea , which are then changed by indira into rain .
the climate of this dvipa never alters in cold or heat , so they are not bound to protect themselves against either .
they have no rain , but the water bubbles up for them out of the earth and drops down from the mountains .
this is also the case with the following dvipas . . . .
they have beautiful faceo and worship bkagavat they bring offerings to the fire . . .
this dvipa has two kingdoms .
according to the vishnu - purana the inhabitants are pious and without sin and worship vishnu .
the names of their castes are mriga , magadha , manasa and mandaga .
the climate of this dvipa is so healthy and pleasant that the inhabitants of paradise now and then visit it on account of the fragrancy of its air .
in the following table we simply enumerate them without following any particular principle of arrangement .
the northern mountains are the snowy himavant .
in their centre lies kashmir , and they are connected with the country of the turks .
this mountain region becomes colder and colder till the end of the inhabitable world and mount meru .
of course , these mountains differ very much in cold and heat .
the river biyaha flows east of multan , and joins afterwards the biyatta and candaraha .
the history of valabha is given in its proper place ( cf . chap . xvii ) .
on this era is based the canon khanda - era of the astronomers khadyaka by brahmagupta , which among muhammadans is known as al - arkand . . . .
in a similar manner they also differ among themselves regarding . the beginning of the year .
he wore turkish dress , a short tunic open in front , a high hat , boots and arms .
but for this , we should communicate to the reader the traditions which we have received from some people among them .
besides , lagaturman had bad manners and a worse behaviour , on account of which people complained of him greatly to the vazir .
this hindu shahiya dynasty is , now extinct , and of the whole house there is no longer the slightest remnant in existence .
in acting thus , i do not speculate on the impression which this will make on you .
i have been conquered by you , and therefore i do not wish that another man should conquer you . "
therefore each planet makes within a kalpa certain number of complete revolutions or cycles .
if we compare these secondary statements with the primary statements of the hindus , we discover discrepancies , the cause of which is not known to me .
is their origin due to the translation of alfazari and ya ' kub ?
if , therefore a given number of years commences with the beginning of a kalpa , or a caturyuga , or a kaliyuga , this computation is correct .
also , the reverse of these two eventualities may take place .
we shall communicate to the reader whatever of these rules we happened to learn by the study of their calendars or astronomical handbooks .
the product is divided by the sum - total of the days of the kalpa or taturyuga accordingly as you reckon by the one or the other .
these , however , because not wanted , are disregarded .
the quotient represents signs of the ecliptic .
the remainder of this division is multiplied by 30 , and the product divided by the same divisor .
the quotient represents degrees .
the remainder of this division is multiplied by 60 , and is divided by the same divisor .
the quotient represents minutes .
( mentions - the method of pulisa for the same purpose .
al - biruni concludes by observing that , )
therefore , we refrain from reproducing them , as this would detain us too long and be of no use .
the other methods of the computation of the mean places of the planets and similar calculations have nothing to do with the subject of the present book .
some of these things have already been mentioned in the preceding chapters . . . .
thus , e . g . one minute in the sphere of saturn is equal to 262 minutes in the sphere of the moon .
therefore , the times in which saturn and the moon traverse the same space are different , whilst their motions are equal .
i have never found a hindu treatise on this subject , but only numbers relating there to scattered in various books numbers which are corrupt .
he is said to look like a gaddi with a red cap on his head and a hookah in his hands .
the gaddis wear a red muffler to ward off the evil eye .
the king had become very angry with the angels but was later conciliated and advised to throw ' the fire of his wrath ' in the ocean .
the fire absorbs the water and keeps it from overflowing .
then follows the story of prajapati ' s curse upon moon and its affliction with leprosy .
al - biruni then , in a very rare reference to a political event , mentions the destruction of the somanath temple by sultan mahmud .
the image was destroyed by the prince mahmud may god be merciful to him ! a . h . 416 .
part of it has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town , together with the cakrasvarnin , an idol of bronze , that had been brought from taneshar .
for he wrote the brahmasiddlumla when he was only thirty years of age .
if this indeed is his excuse , we accept it , and herewith drop the matter . . . .
further , he is not allowed continually to busy himself with horses and cows , with the care for the cattle , nor with gaining by usury .
the blue colour is impure for him , so that if it touches his body , he is obliged to wash himself .
lastly , he must always beat the drum before the fire , and recite for it the prescribed holy texts .
he dwells outside civilisation , and leads the same life again which he led in the first period .
he does not take shelter under a roof , nor wear any other dress but some bark of a tree , simply sufficient to cover his loins .
this is a description for the whole country within the just - mentioned boundaries .
if he passes beyond them he commits a sin .
if the eating is finished , the spot is washed and plastered to become clean again .
he rules the people and defends them , for he is created for this task .
he girds himself with a single cord of the threefold yajnopavita , and a single other cord of cotton .
this takes place after he has finished the twelfth year of his life .
the kine rode to him and found him on the banks of the ganges , hanging on something with his head downwards .
the king bent his bow , shot at him , and pierced his bowels .
the brahmans walk behind her and perform sacrifices to the fire where she castes dung .
in some parts there are periodically returning physical disasters ; in others they are entirely unknown .
all these things induce civilised people carefully to select the places where they want to build towns .
that which makes people do these things is usage and custom .
however , religious commands are much more powerful , and influence much more the nature of man than usages and customs .
the sin which a man commits thereby corresponds to the amount by which the percentages have increased the capital stock .
other hindus told me that the brahmans used to suffer from the eating of cows ' meat .
as this is the case , they forbade eating cows ' meat , because it is essentially thick and cold .
ever since the brahmans live by asking and begging , and the penal code is exercised under the control of the kings , not under that of the scholars .
however , the kings do not for any of these crimes kill a brahman or kshatriya , but they confiscate his property and banish him from their country .
the law of theft directs that the punishment of the thief should be in accordance with the value of the stolen object .
an adulteress is driven out of the house of the husband and punishment of an adulteress banished .
and how should that be possible ?
afterwards she has no more income from the house of her father .
whether the deceased has left any property or not .
if there are several claimants of the same degree of relationship , as , e . g . sons or brothers , they all get equal shares .
a hermaphrodite is reckoned as a male being .
in that case the king has no right to meddle with the inheritance , but it is exclusively spent on alms - giving .
among the fairs connected with local deities , the kahika fair of the kulu valley is an important one .
thousands of tevo - tees come to the fair and there are brisk sales of local produce , consisting of woollen shawls , caps , and several other articles .
afterwards the people of the village reassemble at the house of the ' dhangaspa ' family and garland all the family members of the clan .
thereupon there appeared a legislator who ordered people to expose their dead to the wind .
there is a point in man by which he is what he is .
therefore his followers , the shamanians , throw their dead into the rivers .
the bodies of children under three years are not burned .
burning oneself is forbidden to brahmans and kshatriyas by a special law .
if such a twig enters into the soil , it is like a supporting column to the branch whence it has grown .
fasting is with the hindus voluntary and supererogatory .
fasting is abstaining from food for a certain length of time , which may be different in duration and in the manner in which it is carried out .
from that moment he abstains from food .
on the third day he eats nothing except what by chance is given him without his asking for it .
on the fourth day he fasts .
another kind , called pamka , is this : a man takes his food at noon on three consecutive days .
then he transfers his eating - hour to the evening during three further consecutive days .
then he fasts uninterruptedly during three consecutive days without breaking fast .
if a man fasts all the days of caitra , he obtains wealth and joy over the nobility of his children .
if he fasts in jyaishtha , he will be a favourite of the women .
if he fasts in ashadha , he will obtain wealth .
if he fasts in sravana , he obtains wisdom .
if he fasts in bhadrapada , he obtains wealth and valour , riches and cattle .
if he fasts in asvayuja ; he will always be victorious over his enemies .
if he fasts in kartikka , he will . . . obtain his wishes .
if he fasts in margasirsha , he will be born in the most beautiful and fertile country .
if he fasts in magha , he obtains innumerable wealth .
if he fasts in phalguna , he will be beloved .
( some of the single fast - days throughout the year are mentioned . among these are : )
the sixth day of caitra is a fast - day holy to the sun .
the day of full moon in the month sravana is a fast - day hoiy to somanath . . . .
the fifth day of bhadrapada is a fast - day holy to the sun , called shat . . . .
it is called deotthini i . e . the rising of the deva .
others add , besides , the condition that it must be the eleventh of the white half . . . .
on the sixth day of pausha is a fasting in honour of the sun .
on the third day of magha there is fasting for the women , not for the men .
they perform the same in their houses during the whole day and make merry .
the full moon ' s day of this month is a festival to the women , full moon ' s day called rupa - panca ( ? )
during this time the household is provided with new vessels .
on the 8th asvayuja , when the moon stands in the nineteenth station , mula , begins the sucking of the sugarcane .
they give much alms before it and kill kids .
they distribute alms during fifteen days in the name of the fathers .
on the following day they give alms , they give banquets and receive guests .
the women ' s washing with cold water is common to all the days of this month . . . .
262 india by al - biruni on the 23rd , which is called puyattan ( ? ) , they eat rice with butter 23rd phalguna and sugar .
in accordance with the belief of the hindus regarding this increase and wane , the brahmans sacrifice continually to the fire in order to earn heavenly reward .
they let the portions of the angels accumulate , which are the offerings thrown into the fire at moonlight during the whole time from new moon to full moon .
he thinks that such an exact determination could only be made by ' resorting to very artificial ways of interpretation . ' )
the times which are specially favourable to earn a heavenly " the days called punyakala reward in them are called punyakala . . . .
not withstanding the nature of the punyakala is such as here explained , some of them are considered as lucky , others as unlucky days .
those days are lucky when the planets migrate from one sign into the other , especially the sun . these times are called samhmnti .
the samkranti most propitious of them are the days of the equinoxes and solstices , and of these the most propitious is the day of the vernal equinox .
this process lasts , in the case of the sun , nearly two hours .
( two different methods for calculating the moment of samkranti are mentioned .
at that time , according to their belief , all the waters of the times of eclipses earth become as pure as that of the ganges .
further , the times of parvan are propitious , i . e . those times in parvan and yoga which an eclipse may take place .
and even if there is no eclipse at such a time , it is considered quite as propitious as the time of an eclipse itself .
this yoga is called watipata
a table showing the names and the qualities of the yogas , is also given .
to these things hindu astrologers join certain methods of the astrology of nativities , which other nations do not take into account . . . .
i mention these things in order to show the reader the difference between the astrological methods of our people and those of the on comets hindus .
their theories and methods regarding aerial and cosmic phenomena are very lengthy and very subtle at the same time .
the head of the dragon is called rahu , the tail ketu .
the hindus seldom speak of the tail , they only use the head .
in general , all ' comets which appear on heaven are also called ketu .
( quotation from varahamihira ' s samhita regarding different kinds of comets , their prognostics , etc . are given .
in fact , at another place ( p . 177 ) al - biruni himself writes this ' buddhodana , the son of suddhodana . '
sachau seems to have missed this clear reference .
280 india by al - biruni the word shamamans is used in arabic to denote the buddhists .
it is divided into six parts , five of which deal with cosmic matters .
vishnu dharma ( p . 35 ) .
actually , al - biruni ' s account also gives some glimpses of the actual situation .
this may also be taken as indicative of inter - caste marriages to some extent .
karmatians ( p . 53 ) .
a well - organised extremist seat which appears at first to have been associated with the isma ' ili movement but whose origins remain obscure .
it laid stress on esoteric interpretation of some religious doctrines and was characterised by some communistic tendencies .
hamdan qarmat , an iraqi peasant , was the founder of the sect , and its followers came to be known as qarmatians .
they established a state on the western shore of persian gulf ( 899 ) which became a constant source of trouble to the abbasid caliphate .
later they established their rule over the greater part of upper sind .
varahamihira ( p . 53 ) .
it may be noted that the list of smriti books given by al - biruni is very important in one respect .
it contains the names of some minor smritis , such as atri , harita and daksha .
this helps us to determine the lower time - limit of the period of their compilation .
the absence of any reference by al - biruni to sankaracharya is surprising .
nyayabhasa composed by kapila ( p . 60 ) .
its original objective was to explain the veda , which it regarded as primeval and superhuman .
they believed that perception alone was the source of proof or knowledge .
the book agastymata ( p . 61 ) .
there are two books whose titles bear the prefix agastya .
panini ( p . 63 ) .
he died in 681 .
smdhmd ( p . 70 ) .
al - biruni writes that the indians called every standard work on astronomy a siddhanta .
paulisa and pulisa ( p . 70 ) .
the former was a greek , , and the author of a work on astronomy , the paulisa siddhanta .
he also refers to another work of brahmagupta , called khandakhadyaka , which was known among the arabs as a i - a rkand ( p . 192 ) .
famous indian astronomer and mathematician of the 5th century a . d .
his well - known wtork aryabhatiya was composed in 499 a . d .
al - biruni writes that he had not seen any of his works but knew of him through the quotations given by brahmagupta .
aryabhatta held that the earth was a sphere and it rotated on its axis .
for these views he was strongly criticised by brahmagupta ( p . 174 , 217 ) .
it may be noted that al - biruni refers to two different persons bearing the name aryabhatta .
caraka ( p . 74 ) .
caraka ' s work has been regarded as one of the basic texts on early indian medical science .
barmecides ( p . 74 ) .
the descendants of khalid ibn barmak the powerful and influential wazir of khalifa mansur .
khalid was the son of the chief priest ( barmak ) of a buddhist monastery in balkh .
the barmecides were great patrons of learning , and the period of their dominance witnessed a marked increase in persian and indian cultural influences in the abbasid court .
kalda wa dirnna ( p . 74 ) .
an arabic translation , from an earlier persian translation , of a sanskrit work .
the work contains didactic stories meant to instruct princes in morals and polity .
some material of the lost sanskrit original is available in an expanded form in the pancatantm 30 .
udunpur is purvadesa ( p . 81 ) .
udunpur may be identified with the otlan / avi / iata , one of the four principal universities in early medieval bihar ( 600 - 1200 ) .
it is to be distinguished from the earlier , more well - known , nalanda vihara situated nearby .
kanoj and ban ( p . 94 ) .
the transfer took place on the eve of mahmud ' s invasion of kanauj ( 1018 ) .
fanakh ( p . 94 ) .
a measure of distance , equal to 4 miles .
yakub and alfazari ( p . 137 ) .
a mare is let freely to wander . . . ( p . 230 ) .
according to the standard sources on the point a horse was used for the purpose but al - biruni refers to a mare .
there is a great tree called prayaga . . . ( p . 253 ) .
hindu festivals ( p . 258 ) .
the last - mentioned portion , as sachau points out , is a translation of this chapter of al - biruni .
the bodleian ms copy is a transcript of the cambridge ms copy .
mahanavami , the sister of mahadeva ( p . 260 ) .
the festival obviously corresponds with the durga puja festival of the present times .
42 - 45 . ( p . 260 - 61 ) .
( ii ) divali ( p . 260 ) .
al - biruni mentions it as being celebrated on ' the 1st kartikka , or new moon ' s day , when the sun marches in libra ' .
further , it may be added that the new moon or amawasya is a particular moment of time , not a particular day or date .
the ' new moon ' , technically , does not indicate its visibility on the horizon .
( iii ) dhola ( ie . dola ) and shivratri ( p . 261 ) .
the dola festival is the holi festival ' of the present times , as indicated by its date ( 15th phalguna ) and the manner of its observation .
his teachers said he ' d wander around the class , could n ' t concentrate , and if pressured to pay attention he ' d get belligerent .
that was when we took him to the uk and he was diagnosed with adhd .
he ' s been on medication ever since .
in the morning , he ' s temperamental , speaks fast and ca n ' t comprehend things because he ca n ' t concentrate .
but once he takes his medicines he ' s okay .
it was traumatic for us at first because we did n ' t know what was wrong .
so my wife went back to college to do a master ' s in special education .
at least we understand what ' s happening now . "
recent studies indicate that adhd affects anything from 1.5 - 4 per cent of youngsters in india .
though that adds up to huge numbers , what is heartening is that it ' s much smaller than the percentage of those affected in the west .
doctors in india have so far been in the unique position of treating adhd in the absence of a specific drug for the problem .
for them , the only hope is that the media and medicos will spread the word that the constantly restless or inattentive child may not necessarily be indisciplined .
that child might just need help .
it ' s important to differentiate between a normally mischievous little one and a child with a problem .
the study arrived at this figure on the basis of descriptive answers given by parents and teachers in 65 workshops held over the past two years .
" at the age of 15 months , he would hit his head against the wall .
he ' s broken a few telephones and one tv in our house .
in kapil ' s case there is the distinct possibility of " co - morbidity , of adhd and conduct disorders in the same child " .
in which case it is the teacher who needs counselling . "
" that day i really cried .
when the teacher said that we have spoilt our child , i came home and cried and cried .
you ca n ' t get my son to sit for a moment .
the teachers do n ' t understand .
methylphenidate is seen by many as a boon , since it ' s considered highly effective in dealing with adhd .
but being a stimulant that ' s prone to abuse and known to retard physical growth , it should be prescribed with care .
despite the dangers of wrong treatment , what is as worrisome is the lack of it .
in less than a week , farooq found himself on the wrong end of the seesaw .
if the gamble now appears like a centre - state confrontation , it is because there were miscalculations at both ends .
part of the problem stemmed from the unreal hopes following advani ' s initial comment that the resolution would be taken up by parliament .
to some extent , farooq is nervous about the ongoing secret talks between the hurriyat and delhi ' s non - official negotiators .
this is the only way it can banish the feeling of alienation that pervades kashmir today .
unfortunately , that may have happened .
but not in bastar , where tribals depend on the bounty of jungle and the economy revolves around food - gathering .
nutrition is , of course , not the only value of bamboo , the strongest and most useful among grasses .
" without bamboos the villagers cannot survive , " says m . n . buch , former forest secretary of madhya pradesh .
bamboos are also used as poles , shafts and pillars , and are commonly fashioned into fishing rods and yokes .
and innovatively enough , hollow bamboo poles are useful for storing grain and oil and carrying water .
the tribals also depend on the bamboo to augment their incomes .
the tall grass is used for making baskets , weaving mats and for creating decorative items .
and almost all scaffolding in india is made from bamboo .
ironically , the flowering of bamboo can be a boon to forest conservators .
and here is the once - in - 40 - year opportunity to garner bamboo seeds .
the blooming bamboos of bastar will yield 3,000 to 4,000 quintals of the rare seed .
consequently , the department does not hope to gather more than 200 quintals of seeds .
a pity , for a careful mopping operation could have helped a planned regeneration of massive swathes of bamboo .
but at the end of the day it was politics that triumphed .
other owners include former congress ministers and mps , a former cabinet secretary and scores of ias officers .
regularisation flies in the face of the capital ' s master plan , which vows to keep delhi ' s green lungs alive and promote open areas .
it even goes against the advice of the high court .
i have , therefore , decided to regularise the occupants on recovery of price of the land plus penalty .
this roughly works out to rs 22,500 per sq metre .
sinha had promptly shot back a reply , asking why the government should incur a revenue loss of rs 86 crore .
the cost of the land alone is a staggering rs 110 crore .
when it comes to land - - especially in the capital - - there are obviously many vested interests , including politicians at the very top .
that ' s another moral of the same story .
if our liberals are so infuriatingly sanctimonious and principled , why are they such colossal funks ?
thackeray is said to be a coward in dread of spending a night in a smelly lock - up .
so why ca n ' t our liberals be more like thackeray ?
why must they fall back on trivial technicalities and plain illegalities to settle their aesthetic scores ?
what happened in mumbai last week was shameful .
it was outrageous that sainiks threatened retribution on the streets and created a great fear .
but equally despicable was the willingness of the conscience - keepers of secularism to bend the rules to fight fascism .
sometimes people also have magically potent nails driven on their entrance doors .
each house has a little ' baba ' thada ( mound ) in the courtyard .
there googa is portray -
in the monsoon month of bhadrapada , people make special trips to the holy thans of these siddhas to be rid of the fear of snake bites .
before taking on thackeray , our liberals must first develop a spine .
by ruben banerjee temples in india are busy places .
the religious - - sadhus and lay people - - throng them .
and then there are the hawkers selling garlands and tacky bead strings , conch shells and sacred cloth , tea and biscuits and what have you .
around the anantagopal temple in chatia - - about 20 km out of cuttack - - you will find a completely different set : construction workers .
no , this is not renovation time at the temple .
the simple fact is construction work at the anantagopal temple never stops .
masons , carpenters and labourers jostle with worshippers round the year .
tradition has it that work on the temple must go on and on - - and so it has been since time immemorial .
the temple gets plastered over and over again , new brick walls are added and doors and windows dismantled and refixed ceaselessly .
the endless constructions are certainly a drain on the temple exchequer but then age - old customs too cannot be done away with .
since the temple ' s present cannot be any different from its past , there is work going on even now .
a scaffolding perpetually stands around the temple , and masons are at work giving the exteriors a fresh coat of plaster .
elsewhere , a boundary wall is being raised with an ornamental entrance that will resemble the dome of the famous tirupati temple .
but it is not because of a simple flight of fancy of the temporal authorities that the anantagopal temple continues to be built endlessly .
no one in chatia , therefore , expects the work to come to a halt till jagannath ' s return .
" it will stop only when the lord returns , " says jagannath das , another hereditary trustee .
so work goes on relentlessly .
the people found an alternative instead , and built a college nearby in the name of saint haridas , the founder of the temple .
however , no one may come out before midday .
however , no one may come out before midday .
these must be in odd numbers .
it is considered auspicious to see this platter full of statues and figures early in the morning .
the young men and women put henna ( seur ) on their palms and the soles of their feet .
this festival symbolises the well being and prosperity of the entire community .
the walls are hung over with flower garlands .
afterwards they are placed within the house .
afterwards they are placed within the house .
sweets are distributed and the young ones seek the blessings of the elderly .
people also gamble on this day with cards or with cowrie shells .
the khogal night is also all lit up with clay lamps like the diwali night .
at midnight the ' chan ' ( the drummers ) sit on someone ' s rooftop and begin to play their drums and flutes .
this is a signal to begin the khogal celebrations .
as soon as the sound comes , people run with lighted torches towards their houses screaming ah !
hee !
in the end all the torches are piled together and as the flames leap up , people dance around the bonfire .
after they return home , the people offer pooja to their family deities includiug the local deity baraja .
floors of the temples are cleansed and polished in the hope that the gods will throw good things from the heavens , upon them .
at the end , a goat is sacrificed to please the demons .
on a large platter , some cakes made of mixed flour are placed , and carried to the deity by four men .
this place is marked by a tree or a shrub or a little mound .
she is followed by two men , one carrying a lighted torch and the other , a bunch of pine branches bundled in sheepskin .
the woman who has borne her first son leads the procession of devotees which consists of other mothers of sons .
a month before this , the field workers go round from house to house singing , lohadi song known as ' lohkadiyan ' .
the people welcome the singers , and give them gifts of foodgrains .
the houses are cleaned and the monsoon gods are welcomed by name .
if an arrow hits home , it is taken to be a sign of the victory of gods over demons in the heaven .
during this period , the villages turn very quiet .
after three rounds of the temple people try to snatch the ' doo ' which they feed to their animals .
when the crops are ready to be harvested , a ram or a chhelu ( a he - goat ) is taken round the fields first and then sacrificed .
before being slain , the animal is sprinkled all over with water , and prayers invoking the gods to accept the sacrifice , are recited .
all the members of the family take turns in sprinkling the water .
this gesture is said to denote the acceptance of the animal by the deity .
some guru ' s pick up the carcass of the animals and putting their mouth to its neck , drink the animal ' s blood and dance with abandon .
it is belived that it is the deity manifest in them who does all this .
the pahadi language shows traces of all three khasa , kirata and kinnar influences .
the languages spoken in these areas belong to the tibeten - burmese family of languages .
the inner or south eastern part includes the areas of sirmaur , solan , simla , kulu , churah and pangi .
the outer or north western part contains the bilaspur , mandi , himirpur , una , kangra and chamba districts .
m . r . thakur has done intensive work on the kullui dialect .
kangri this is commonly spoken in the present day in kangra , hamir - pur , ooona , sarkaghat , j6ginder nagar and gumarvin areas .
in popularising and getting published works of kangri , this writer and m . s . randhawa have contributed a great deal .
the songs sung prior to , and after the birth of a son are called bihaiyan .
at the time of an eclipse , it is forbidden to eat , cook or have sexual intercourse .
such songs are often sung at the time of the bride ' s departure .
funeral songs are also sung everywhere in himachal .
in kinnaur , the ashta yamo songs are sung at the time of the last rites .
dale diya dhara ufale bajde , bauda baje tamboor loko ,
llkhi parvane bhaicharejo bhejda , minjo deni madad loko ,

hauku mian ki har ( the defeat of hauku mian ) is a ballad sung in the sirmour area in the winter month of magha and during diwali .
king ' s vazier mahta , tricks him into visiting the palace for negotiations .
the broom is tied on an auspicious day and first wedded ritualistically to a tree and prayed to , before being used for sweeping the house .
these songs are sung by the dom singers in the month of chaitra ( sohi rut ) from door to door .
the ballad of nat - nati ( the trapeze artist and his wife ) , is very popular in the sirmor area .
folk tales people in himachal . love listening to tales .
some tales are based on animal lore .
some of these stories are about local patriots and warriors also .
each village can boast of at least five or six such gappis ( spinners of fantasies ) .
the himachal sayings reflect the deep seated beliefs of the people in the area , in spheres ranging from the philosophical to the social .
the cow is worshipped as a holy animal .
seeing a cow first thing in the morning and touching its feet is supposed to bring good luck .
if one cannot afford to buy a cow , one has to give away a rupee and a quarter as a token payment .
the disembodied forms of a ghostly spirit began to assume several forms in my mental eye .
he came and sat near the fire and asked me laughingly if i was scared .
that night he narrated to me several eerie tales about the local deities and wandering ghosts and spirits .
after much persuation he agreed , and asked a boy to bring a pinch of ashes .
stale bread , poverty , a woman who wanders around ,
he then put the ashes on his palm , muttering an incantation , and blew it towards the skies .
even now the pine tree stands at the turn in the road and is known as the chhattarwali cheed ( the pine with a crown ) .
a riddle from the sirmaur area runsa bird has rare wings but she has nine thousand offspring .
similarly corn looked upon as the queen of crops , a staple food item in the area , also figures in many riddless :
a riddle about this goes :
its complicated functioning is defined thus in a popular riddle :
the seeds were sown in water , the creaper grew in the backyard ,
a , needle and scissor ) 5 the mother is yet to be born , but the son has arrived .
in the sarahana area people make the figure of the legendary king bali with kneaded flour .
lohadi is a festival of fire worship .
they were , therefore , recognised as eggs only with the aid of the microscope .
while one is the basic unit of life , the other is that of inanimate matter .
as a result the incipient daughter cells are just half the size of the parent cell .
it results in millions and billions of cells with exactly the same heredity or nuclear structure as the original .
these minute structures in thin tissue slices can be seen by staining them with certain dyes which they take up more readily than the rest of the cell .
chromosomes in turn are not homogeneous compositions nor single constituents .
all old women in the mother village are adressed as nanis and ones in one ' s own village as dadi .
he might as well have added that if mitosis is a symphony , meiosis is both the melodic overture as well as finale of the orchestra of biological inheritance .
it is by keeping both in double harness that life has driven itself from its primitive pre - cambrian origins to its present peak of sophistication and complexity .
the human sperm and ovum , for instance , each has information to make half a man .
it is this bit of parental body that grows to enormous size to make the offspring .
the body of an adult man , for instance , is 50 billion times as massive as the fertilised egg from which it originated .
this is true of all organisms whether men , mice , cats , or green plants .
this is why both heredity and environment go hand in hand in shaping the life of the offspring from cradle to grave .
this is how our acqueous ancestors ventured out of their marine habitats to live on land as reptiles , birds , mammals and primates .
our own millieu interne , the salt content of our bloodstream , carries the imprint of its origin in the seas .
a modern astronaut in a lunar voyage carries with him a prefabricated miniature of his terrestrial environment , his capsule and space suit .
it is , therefore , obvious that consideration of life without its environmental support is all but meaningless .
all life is the outcome of a complicated interaction between heredity and environment .
it is determined by the number , type and arrangement of genes in the originating fertilised egg or seed .
the phenotype includes all observable traits whether anatomical , physiological , psychological , mental or whatever .
the phenotype of an organism is , therefore , the consequence of the growth and development of a genotype in a certain environment .
every plant , animal or person is the outcome of its genotype and its life experiences .
now the plants in each horizontal row are members of a clone having been obtained by dividing a single individual and replanting the parts in different places .
it follows that these plants are genotypically alike or very similar .
and yet it can be seen that these plants with uniform heredity look very different when grown in different environments .
their reputation for ' objectivity ' and ' truth ' is due to operation in reverse of the brutus aphorism :
it is otherwise with scientific theories .
the true ones , which survive because of their objectivity , alone are preserved and kept alive .
if two dominant genes y and r are originally together in the same chromosome , they will tend to remain together .
for all practical purposes the two factors then assort together and behave as if they were one .
it has been found to have many exceptions .
had he not done so , it is all but certain that he could never have divined the riddle of heredity as he actually did .
but the gift of vision to see way beyond one ' s contemporaries often has its nemesis .
morgan found the banana fly an ideal subject for his experiments .
consider , for the sake of illustration , two heterozygous alleles aa and bb which are carried in the same pair of chromosomes .
let us first suppose that a and b lie in one of the homologous pairs of chromosomes and a and b , in the other .
this is to say that the two dominants were linked in one chromosome and the two recessives in the other .
on crossing with the double recessive , that same association is preserved , for only the double dominant and double recessive types appear .
such a situation where the double dominants and double recessives remain together is called coupling .
in the second situation one dominant and one recessive are carried in each homologous chromosome .
this view of gene and genetic information storage was derived from work on bacteria , single - celled organisms .
they are , to use communication lingo , mere ' noise ' punctuating or interrupting the true ' signal ' .
when the root cause of the malady is made known , then the required rituals are performed and offerings made .
it is believed that the illness will leave the sick one and enter the body of the person who walks over the scattered satnaja .
there is a decrease in the overall free energy or order of the system in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .
we shall find that about 40 per cent of the sugar has been converted into cellular constituents , while the remainder has been oxidised into carbon dioxide and water .
by carrying out the experiment in a calorimeter we can draw up the thermodynamic balance sheet for the operation .
but the liver enzyme , called catalase , reduces it to less than 5 kilocalories .
thus to account for the whole metabolic process of a single cell we require a thousand species of enzymes .
some other important cermonies connected with child birth are the first sighting of the baby by the father and the first feeding of the tonic ghutti to the infant .
it is believed that the child imbibes the temperament of the person who gives him his first dose of ghutti .
in some areas the girls from the village chase the girl ' s father round and round and he pretends to run away .
for this , special poojas are offered and alms are distributed .
children born in the gandhmool hour are considered unlucky , and are often gifted away ritually as soon as they are born .
there are three main types of nucleotides in a nucleic acid linked together according to the following arrangement :
nitrogenous base the sugar in the middle is always of the same kind , a different kind in dna and rna .
we shall begin our description of the genetic language by first spelling out its alphabet .
this task is accomplished in four steps as illustrated in fig . 23 .
fourth , transfer rna carries out the protein synthesis from the surrounding pool of amino acids .
there are 20 different varieties of such transfer rnas each corresponding to 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins .
we will not dwell on the elaborate researches done to discover triplet equivalents of the 20 amino acids .
how many sets of 23 cards could you pick up in this way ?
in some areas during the various festivals , gifts of jewellery and clothes are sent to the betrothed .
except in the lahaul area , the bride and the groom are carried in palanquins .
single plant selections are then made and evaluated in the same way as in the pedigree method .
the chief advantage of the bulk population method is that it allows the breeder to handle large numbers of individuals inexpensively .
often an outstanding variety can be further improved by transferring to it some specific character that it lacks .
in this the girl is forcibly dragged away from a fair ground or a festival meeting .
this is an influence of tibetan customs .
for the farmer must buy new hybrid seed each year from a specialised seed producer .
the techniques developed for producing hybrid corn are now spreading to the production of other economically important crops also .
in sorghum , onions , beets , and now in corn , the hybrids are produced by the ' male - sterility ' method .
for each species , races have been developed containing a gene that causes a failure of pollen production .
it is these exceptions that are often the source of new discoveries in biology .
one such treasureworthy exception pertains to the basic law of heredity requiring chromosomes to occur in pairs within the nucleus of a somatic cell .
but it some - times happens that cell division fails to occur after the chromosomes have duplicated themselves .
there is also a tetraploid with 28 chromosomes .
it probably originated from the basic diploid ( 2n ) variety by doubling of the chromosome number .
ordinary wheat is even a higher polyploid . it is hexaploid ( 6n ) with 42 chromosomes .
all of them are products of the hybridisation of 28 - chromosome wheats with a diploid wild grass " followed by doubling of the chromosome number .
this emergence of bread wheat occurred naturally .
in 1943 , when the programme began , mexico imported half of the wheat consumed in the country .
in an experimental farm triticale yielded 8.3 and 7.2 tons per hectare .
in the same way mathematical biologists have established a number of laws or principles governing the evolution of populations .
it is the limiting case when there is no evolution with the population remaining so to speak in a genetic strait - jacket .
this is the celebrated hardy - weinburg theorem referred to earlier .
such a population will obviously be a mixed assortment of only three genotypes yy , yy , and yy .
the genotype frequencies in the two generations will therefore be as follows :
there are , of course , many complications ignored in our illustration .
for example , a rather complex situation arises when the gene in question happens to be sex - linked like the haemophilia gene .
thus it can be shown that the effect of selection is often balanced by that of mutation .
in pangi , at the time of the marriage , the groom ' s younger brother presents the bride ' s mother with a silver rupee .
this gives mm the right of a second husband over the bride , but the bride is net to be shared by more than two brothers .
some times the widow leaves her husband ' s house and moves in with someone . this is known as ghar kama ( taking another house ) .
among the lower castes , often a womam may make four to five such changes of spouse in her lifetime .
in this the couple seeking divorce takes a twig of shur wood and snap it in front of witnesses and throw it behind them .
in lahaul a woollen thread is similarly snapped , symbolising the termination of marital ties .
after he came here , he was given a drink of pyas ( the magically potent holy waters ) twice and is now completely cured .
a friend of mine who was a native of the village i was visiting , had a neighbour who died suddenly .
the existence of universal forms of metabolic pathways , the heart of cellular chemistry , is no mere accident .
however , the hifi reproduction is not absolute because of the operation of quantum mechanical laws .
some of these quantum perturbations do create more or less discrete modifications in certain elements of the dna sequence .
another source of these perturbations is exposure to radiation , both natural as well as man - made .
the treatment of a heart attack is best done in a hospital and will not be gone into here .
the treatment of angina should also be under the guidance of a physician and involves the following :
the three important groups of drugs for the treatment of angina are nitrates for immediate and continued relief : b - blockers , calcium - blockers , and aspirin .
every patient must be given adequate treatment along these lines and if the symptoms are not controlled , the question of angiography and bypass surgery should be considered .
the same precautions with regard to risk factors will have to continue even after bypass surgery .
coronary bypass surgery : this is illustrated on the next page diagram ( fig.13 ) .
much depends on the technique used , on the continuance of risk factors and other factors not well understood .
in recent years , many patients have to have a second operation after a lapse of several years because of closure of these grafts .
prevention is the logical course to follow and many affluent countries now have vigorous preventive programmes .
the earlier the age at which these preventive measures are started , the greater the long - term benefits .
cancer accounts for 20 per cent , accidents for 4 per cent and the balance of 26 per cent is made up by all other causes .
prevention many developing countries the world over are evolving programmes for the prevention of rheumatic heart disease as it is an eminently preventable condition , if well organised .
all these events planted a deeply rooted hatred in their heart * .
this prince chose the holy war as his calling , and therefore called himself al - ghau ( i . e . warring on the road of allah ) .
their scattered remains cherish , of course , the most inveterate aversion towards all muslims .
they are haughty , foolishly vain , self - conceited , and stolid .
what scholar , however , has the same favourable opportunities of studying this subject as i have ?
the hindus had no men of this stamp both capable and willing to bring sciences to a classical perfection .
both ' kinds of things are equal in their eyes , since they cannot raise themselves to the methods of a strictly scientific deduction .
i mention the necessary sanskrit names and technical terms once where the context of our explanation demands it .
the existence of god they consider as a real existence , because everything that exists , exists through him .
some hindu scholar calls god a point , meaning to say thereby that the qualities of bodies do not apply to him .
praise be to god , who is far above measure and number !
therefore , they called them gods , built temples in their names and offered them sacrifices . . .
the greeks call in general god everything that is glorious and noble , and the like usage exists among many nations .
they go even so far as to call gods the mountains , the seas , &amp; c .
secondly , they apply ; the term god in a special sense to the first cause , to the angels , and to their souls .
according to a third usage , plato calls gods the sekinat ( = mousai ) .
to this class belongs the word apotheosis , which has a bad sound in the ears of muslims .
they do not think , as other people do , that the fire is a hot dry body near the bottom of the ether .
they understand by fire the common fire on earth which comes from an inflammation of smoke . x - xiv .
they panca mataras describe them as the functions of the senses .
people say the soul resembles the rain - water which comes down from heaven , always the same and of the same nature .
but the soul for its part is guided by the intelligence with which it is inspired by god .
it is now our duty to produce from their literature some clear testimonies as to this subject and cognate theories of other nations .
( there follow some quotations from the gita and other hindu scriptures .
the middle world , that one in which we live , is called madhyaloka and manushyaloka , i . e . the world of men .
in the latter , man has to earn , in the upper to receive his reward ; in the low , to receive punishment .
they serve man in whatever he desires , and are near him in case of need .
brahman and prajapati very nearly mean the same , but they bear different names on account of some quality or other .
indra is the ruler of the worlds .
they have left their bodies behind them , for bodies are weights which impair the power and shorten the duration of life .
their qualities and conditions are different , in the same measure as one or other of the three primary forces prevails over them .
it will remain among them as a generally recognised rule in all generations through the course of time and the flight of ages .
about the same time also minos ( sic ) gave his laws . . .
further , no law can be exchanged or replaced by another , for they use the laws simply as they find them .
( there follows the story of king ambrisha who after a successful reign had taken exclusively to meditation and worship .
a famous idol of theirs was that of multan , dedicated to the sun . and therefore called aditya .
it was of wood and covered with red the idol of multan called aditya cordovan leather ; in its two eyes were two red rubies .
suppose that it was made in the very end of kntayuga , the which has since elapsed amounts to 216,432 years .
the last syllable of theory of the sloka each of the four padas must be the same , viz . a guru .
further , the fifth syllable in e &amp; chpada must always be laehu , the sixth syllable guru .
the seventh syllable must be laghu in the second and fourth padas , guru in the first and third padas .
the other syllables are entirely dependent upon accident or the writer ' s fancy .
( a quotation from brahmagupta , showing the way in which the hindus use arithmetic in the metrical system , is given .
the present times , however , are not of this kind .
they are the very opposite , and therefore it is quite impossible that a new science or any new kind of research should arise in our days .
the authors of these books draw from one and the same source , the book paithamaha , so called from the first father , i . e .
but this is not the case , nor is it so much better than they as to be called the most correct one of the five .
i have commenced translating them , but have not yet finished my work .
i have not enumerated it in this list , because the pretensions which he brings forward in this chapter are repudiated by mathematics .
under governors they understand the acaryas , i . e . the sages , anchorites , the followers of brahman .
about what rasayana means we shall give a separate chapter ( chap . xvii ) .
afterwards he composed another book which he called lavana - mushti , i . e . a handful of salt .
in this , the bride first offers the close relative a gift of money and then covering her hands with the edge of her sari , touches their feet .
he is looked upon as an incarnation of the gods .
if he comes on the day of a festival he must not leave without having had a meal .
visiting relatives and married daughters must not be sent back without gifts of sweets and clothes .
the guests also never arrive empty - handed .
pashana - bhumi , the earth of marble . mahatala .
we exhibit the names of the lokas in a table similar to the former ( p . 211 ) .
the stomach , bhurloka .
ii . the breast .
the mouth .
the eyebrow . maharloka .
janaloka . vi .
above the forehead .
we shall now speak of the division of the surface of the uppermost earth and of related subjects .
the inhabitants of the former island leave their homes , settle on the new one and colonise it .
according to the religious traditions of the hindus , the earth on which we live is round and surrounded by a sea .
on the sea lies an earth like a collar , and on this earth lies again a round sea like a collar .
the number of dry collars , called islands , is seven , and likewise that of the seas .
if the - middle , earth is reckoned as one , the size of all seven earths represented as collars is 127 .
if the sea surrounding the middle , earth is counted as one - , , the size of all seven seas represented as collars is 127 .
the total size of both earths and seas is 254 .
this revolution is finished in 30 muhuita , i . e . in one nichthemeion
he approached rishi vashishtha for this favour but was told that it was impossible .
further , he was scoffed by vashishtha ' s children .
then he went to rishi visvamitra who was pleased by him and began making a ' new paradise ' for the king .
visvamitra agreed on condition that somadatta was to be admitted into paradise with his body , and it was done .
such a thing would not be impossible nor even strange , if the report about it came from a trustworthy man , who had made long sea - voyages .
the latter had a son called dhruva , who was slighted by one of the wives of his father .
on account of this , he was presented with the power to turn round all the stars as he pleased .
he appeared in the manvantara of svayambhuva , the first of all manvantaras , and he has for ever remained in his place , . . .
some describe this mountain as rising above the surface of the earth to an excessive height .
it is situated under the pole , and the stars revolve round its foot , so that rising and setting depends upon meru .
the day of the angels who inhabit meru lasts six months , and their night also six months . "
( the views of balabhadra on this topic are criticised .
serving the in - laws , massaging and rubbing them with oil are all parts of her daily routine .
when the yadavas reached near it and sat drinking , a quarrel occurred among them and they killed each other with the bardi bundles .
arjuna , who had been ordered by vasudeva to burn his body and carry away the women was attacked by robbers on the way .
though he beat them off he felt that his strength was failing him .
he and his brothers , therefore ' emigrated ' to the north and entered the mountains .
they were drawn by two horses . . . .
a ratha comprehends besides , one elephant , three riders , and five footmen .
i ' andana - kala , i . e . the time of the life and the wars of bharata .
the hindus consider it as unlucky , and do not celebrate any of the festivals in it which they celebrate in the other months .
the most unlucky time in this month is that day on which the lunation reaches its end . . . .
this is the difference between the motions of the two heavenly luminaries , whilst the direction in which they move is the same .
in september , in the bhadravah valley , the sacred fair of ' pata ' takes place .
in local language they are known as dalli da nhaun ( the bath of the dal ) .
he sleeps on the earth without any bed , and only nourishes himself by fruit , vegetables , and roots .
he lets the hair grow long , and does not anoint himself with oil .
the fourth period extends till the end of life .
he wears a red garment and holds a stick in his hand .
he does not converse with anybody at all .
if any one gives him something , he does not leave a remainder of it for the following day .
a man sets off to wander to some holy region , to some much venerated idol or to some of the holy rivers .
he shaves the hair of his head and beard , and returns home .
the holy , much venerated ponds are in the cold mountains round meru . . . .
we have already quoted hindu traditions to the effect that in the dvipas there are rivers as holy as the ganges .
in every place to on the construction of holy ponds which some particular holiness is ascribed , the hindus construct ponds intended for the ablutions .
on the surface of the stones between two terraces they construct staircases rising like pinnacles .
however , he must not go beyond it .
if a wife loses her husband by death , she cannot marry another man .
the more ' distant the relationship of a woman with forbidden degrees of marriage regard to her husband the better .
in that case the prohibition is waived , but , notwithstanding , such a marriage is an object of dislike to them .
also is a brahman ; if she is a sudra , her child is a sudra .
in our time , however , the brahmans , although it is allowed to them , never marry any woman except one of their own caste .
in consequence he postpones the sacrifice and unites it with the next following one , which is due in the fourth month of the pregnancy , called simamtonnayanam .
the child receives a name after the days of the childbed have elapsed .
these days are eight for the brahman , twelve for the kshatriya , fifteen for the vaisya , and thirty for the sudra .
for the low - caste people which are not reckoned among any caste , no term is fixed .
the longest duration of the suckling of the child is three years , but there is no obligation in this matter .
in reality , the matter is not as people think , but it is rather this , that the hindus are not very severe in punishing whoredom .
the fault , however , in this lies with the kings , not with the nation .
but for this , no brahman or priest would suffer in their idol - temples the women who sing , dance , and play .
the kings make them an attraction for their cities , a bait of pleasure for their subjects , for no other but financial reasons .
in case there is no written document the contest is settled by means of witnesses without a written document .
the witnesses must not be less than four , but there may be more .
when the arti is performed in the temple , several goats are sacrificed .
people stay up the whole night and dance their folk dances within the temple primises .
an annual fair of the sikhs at panvata sahib takes place each year on the 27th of march .
the changing of the flag ( nishan sahib ) and the colourful bazaar that crops up at the site , are the other chief attractions of this fair .
the holi melas at palampur ghughar , paprola , baijnath , jaisinghpur and sujanpur also have an attraction of their own .
the holi festival of sujanpur traces its colourful history back to the glorious days of king sansar chand .
one of the popular tales runs thus :
hoi was a terrible she - demon , and tortured the people in many ways .
hoi agreed not to torture them collectively if they had agreed to present her with one human each day .
hoi agreed to do that and sent him back safe to get married to his betrothed .
since that day the ashtami put an end to the terrible human sacrifice and is celebrated each year as hoi ashtami .
the statues of ardha vishnu are beautiful examples of the art of metal casting .
the mangath region in kangra district is well - known for brass utensils .
in chamba , kullu , sirmaur and kinnaur areas , some of these old families have interesting collections of such traditional articles .
the tribal areas have their own kind of statues which reflect the religious beliefs of the tribals .
he was a great lover of art and a devotee of lord krishna .
his life ' s ambition was to be like his hero krishna . .
after king ghamand chand annexed kullu , the kangra artists began to visit the kullu area and an intermingling of styles became possible .
sajanu is . a well known painter of the kullu school .
mr . lockwood kipling has said that the kangra school emerged as a significant idiom in the field of painting .
- the kangra school is now ranked among some of the best in the world .
some paintings also depict the common folk , which points at the fact that this school was not limited to the feudal courts alone .
these are painted on walk especially treated for the purpose with clay , lime and golu .
the akhan chandi palace , the laxmi narayan temple , the living rooms of old houses in durga mangnu , are all brilliant examples of this art .
the kangra fort , the narvadeshwar temple , the palaces at sujanpur and the temples and palaces at vijapur and alampur also have wall - paintings .
connubial paintings ( dehre ) and ornamental door hangings are also examples of this art .
the pahadi handkerchief enjoys a special place among the handicrafts of the area .
these handkerchiefs are usually produced in the chamba , kangra , mandi , bilaspur and kullu areas .
sometimes little round pieces of mirror are also incorporated beautifully into the embroidery pattern .
the themes of the plays range from historical to mythological , and are often interpersed with contemporary references .
ramleela , ras - leela , krishnaleela , mythological tales from puranas and history are all similarly presented .
these impromptu shows often present sharp and pungent satires about the bureaucracy , the social malpractices like racial discrimnation and miserliness .
sly and sharp social commentary comes in form of jokes and puns packed with wit and humour .
the role of the female dancer is very important in folk theatre .
jai jai mother jwala mail long live this play , shri sanotosh has - just presented a rupee to the troupe ,
the dialogues in these plays are short and sarcastic or sedate according to the occasion .
the ' holki ' or the dance of the gods is a real visual treat .
the people belonging to the ' nod ' tribe put up special acts for entertaining the spectators .
part of these is rather vulgar .
at the lohadi festival , the village boys act out the haran ka swang and go dancing and singing from door to door .
these are full of songs and dance patterns and are mostly enacted by the weavers or the jhirs or troupes of traditional singers .
the lahaul , spiti and pangi areas are largely followers of buddhism .
the buddhist viharas at tambo , dankhar and spiti are very popular in the area .
the trilok nath shrine at spiti has a statue with eleven faces and a thousand arms .
an old tree near the shrine is said to be an old demon , who is worshipped as a local deity .
mohana , and gangi are very popular .
this may be shown by the same matrix method we have hitherto employed .
in the absence of dominance , each of these 27 distinct genotypes would produce a separate effect .
we thus observe that mendel ' s second law provides an opportunity for bringing together genes which have arisen separately .
let a be the gene for eye colour and b that foi the wing shape in the case of banana fly , drosphila melanogaster .
consequently the two genotypes aa / bb and - aa / bb should arise in equal proportion .
these two types , which represent a harking back to the grand - parental traits , are called the recombination classes .
together they measure the percentage frequency of crossingover .
it is called the crossover value and is obtained by adding together the two recombination classes and expressing them as a percentage of the total number of offsprings .
in the instant case , the crossover value is 2 per cent .
the example just described is one of coupling .
thus there are four pairs of chromosomes in banana fly .
consequently all its genes belong to one or other of the four groups .
in other words , the demon is able to trade information for power .
its physical embodiment is the punch card with a set of holes bored therein with the hole corresponding to ' energised ' state denoted by 1 .
there were , of course , many tricks to learn about how to prepare suitable immunising materialsthe vaccines and sera .
obviously , therefore , an antigen and its corresponding antibody cannot normally coexist in the same individual .
since there are two antigens a and b , we can have only four mutually exclusive possibilities .
the pagband system decrees that the property shall first be distributed among the daughters and then among the sons .
sometimes a middleman is used as a match - maker , known variously as roovary , dhamu or mazomi .
matches in the same gotra are not considered very good .
thus a person of blood group , say , b in the oab system may belong to group m , or , n , or mn in the other .
consider first the genetics of the mn blood groups .
the inheritance of blood groups oab is a little more complex than that of mn groups or other wholly genetical traits we have so far considered .
in these relatively simpler situations every gene had two variants or alleles , one of which was dominant over the other or co - dominant with it .
but many genes have mutated more than once in evolution and now exist in three or more different forms .
thanks to our new knowledge of the interplay of heredity and environment we now know better .
the most striking difference in this respect is that between males and females .
the reason for this discrimination seems to lie in the fact that the human female has to bear the burden of maternity .
as a result artificial mutations may also be induced .
consequently a mutation , once it has occurred , is inherited and becomes perpetuated exactly like the original gene from which it arose .
this is why most mutations are injurious and give rise to hereditary diseases in man as well as in plants and animals .
but there do arise once in a while some mutations that are either better or at any rate no worse than their originals .
unfortunately , we cannot even discover what would happen because of the great complexity of the complimentary relationship between heredity and environment .
an xyy individual with an extra male chromosome y is usually predisposed to criminal violence .
this hereditary anaemia was first recognised in the populations of the mediterranean countries where malaria had been rampant for centuries .
infections with malignant tertiary malaria are reported to be less severe in the heterozygotes ( tt ) than those with the normal homozygotes ( tt ) .
since the malarial parasite multiplies in the red cell , living largely on haemoglobin , it is not surprising that this should be so .
sickle - cell anaemia is due to a recessive mutant gene ( a ) which produces yet another abnormal variant of haemoglobin .
this variant can carry only half the normal amount of oxygen from the lungs to the diverse parts of the body .
the heterozygotes ( aa ) are only half anaemic .
it enables the recipient to resist malaria better than the normal homozygotes ( aa ) and survive .
the next step ' a ' in this conversion happens to be the production of tyrosine .
the upshot is a disease called phertylketonuria ( pku ) which results in mental deficiency .
these proportions may be transformed into percentages by multiplying them by 100 .
the population would now consist almost exclusively of the two pure or homozy - gous classes ( aa ) and ( aa ) ( fig . 38 ) .
vigour has a definite , though complicated , genetic basis .
it is , therefore , no wonder that vigour has a correspondingly complicated genetic basis and is dependent on many genes which are mc reover dominant .
let us label only two of these vigour - sponsoring dominant genes a , b , and their weak or recessive counterparts a , b .
this increased vigour produced by crossing two different strains or races is precisely what we earlier called heterosis .
progenies of individual plant selections are then grown and evaluated by simple observation frequently over a period of several years .
during the period of bulk propagation natural selection tends to eliminate plants having poor survival value .
all such plants with more than two sets of chromosomes in their cells are known as polyploids .
polyploids are seldom fround in the animal kingdom , but they are not at all uncommon in the plant kingdom .
consider , for example , wheat .
the basic variety is a diploid plant with seven pairs of chromosomesa total of 14 .
this is precisely how the present varieties of ordinary wheat have arisen .
as we mentioned before , ordinary wheat is a hexaploid with 42 chromosomes .
all of them are products of the hybridisation of 28 - chromosome wheats with a diploid wild grass " followed by doubling of the chromosome number .
but increase in height of the stems is a natural reaction of plants which are given irrigation , water and fertilisers .
however , wheat production in many parts of the world including subtropical and tropical highlands is still limited by stem rust .
but if a hexaploid wheat with 42 chromosomes is crossed with it , the upshot is an octaploid having 56 chromosomes .
so far the hexaploid plants have proved to be more stable than the octaploids .
the cultured embryo is kept in the dark until roots begin to appear .
it is then allowed to grow in light under constant illumination .
this is how a new viable hybrid cereal of wheat and rye first arose .
it is a new genus called triticale , an intergenic hybrid that has the characteristics of both its parentswheat and rye ( fig . 46 ) .
fig . 46 : breeding of triticale ( t ) begind ( a ) with a cross between wheat ( w ) and rye ( r ) .
the first - generation triticale plant ( f , ) , is made fertile with colchicine treatment , and the resulting seeds become the second generation ( f2 ) .
triticale - triticale crosses are also made ( d ) .
thanks to this chance fertilisation there arose a year later ( two generations ) several unusually promising plants in a segregating population .
their genetic ' makeup clearly indicated the value of the illicit stray wheat pollen grain .
the sterile triticale plant was a tall hexaploid cross called x 308 .
the wheat pollen that fertilised it was most likely a mexican dwarf bread wheat .
the progeny of x 308 and the unknown dwarf wheat are now called armadillo .
by further selection many fully fertile armadillo strains have been produced , compared and standardised .
they have two main advantages over wheat .
first , in comparable conditions they seem to give higher yields than wheat .
ters , an ancient dogma revived by lamarck in 1809 .
it is greatly compounded by the inaccessibility of their reproductive mechanism and long duration of their reproductive cycle .
both have been a perpetual problem to natural scientists concerned with their evolution and heredity .
in animals the adaptive changes are supposed to be more indirect .
conversely , the disuse of other parts leads to their atrophy .
for a much longer period jews and mohammedans have had their male babies circumcised and yet their boys are still born unmutilated .
it is a tragic consequence of our life that since we first discover , the world through a language we are apt to mistake the language for the world .
quantum physics is a case in point .
likewise , if a nuclear entity like an electron is a discrete particle , it is also a wave diffused over a continuum .
since then much work has been done on this ' transformation ' phenomenon .
there it places the original segment and establishes itself as part of the bacterial cell ' s inheritable mechanism .
the environment therefore plays its part in shaping the finished product .
but it took him and his collabo - rators over 10 years to do so .
but he rose to real prominence in 1929 when he first proposed his vernalisation technique to reduce losses of winter wheat .
such recombinant genetic manipulations have hitherto been confined to only lower organisms , like unicellular bacteria .
the reason is the fundamental difference between the cells of bacteria and those of higher plants and animals .
but polygenic characters sponsored by several genes have not yet been transferred .
there are two views about polygenic manipulations of bacteria and viruses .
there are further complications due to diverse interrelationships between these levels .
consider , for instance , the genetic modification of a bacterium like e . coli by inserting therein a synthetic gene .
it is not yet clear if the same technique can be applied to higher organisms .
still other uses of genetic engineering techniques are improvement in the quality of plants .
this may well prove to be the next big leap after the domestication of wild cereals with which agricul -
one of the nicest things one could do is to make plants that could fix nitrogen without . having to have these bacteria associated with them .
now they go by the name of genes , and we are their survival machines . "
one reason is the observed fall in fertility of some animals , such as rats under the stress of overcrowding .
he argues that his theory is better than the usual one that such low - fertility females are preferred by natural selection .
it is , therefore , of genetic origin .
but such rigid inflexibility was not the association he had in mind when he wrote it .
it is a devious way of wriggling out of an untenable position he had taken earlier .
his suggestion of ' common wives ' must have caused as much stir in his days as that of muller in our own .
muller died in 1967 and his idea does not seem likely to be brought into practice in any foreseeable future .
he was not content with merely safeguarding the heredity of the guardians .
he further developed his concept of population control and , in particular , described his eugenic proposals for public hymeneals of licensed ; public breeders .
it was widely popularised by historians , like j . r . green and novelists like h . g . wells .

and having thus turned back the clock , we can regenerate the stock , proceeding to our final goal by race , as well as birth control .
in particular , a turk should generally beat an armenian or a jew in a business deal . this is notoriously not the case .
the diverse systems of intelligence quotients ( iq ) devised by psychologists do not differentiate between the different ' mental ' factors involved therein .
they simply measure , what one psychologist wrote as , " conglomerates of heterogeneous abilities combined in unknown ( and varying ) proportions . "
it is true that there are other genetic diseases caused by recessive genes which are - relatively much more frequent .
in india there are several centres today where such treatment can be obtained .
the following can be eaten freely : lean meat , chicken , fish , skimmed milk and cottage cheese .
refined sugar , apart from producing dental caries , is believed to be responsible for atherosclerosis .
when should it be done ?
the barriers which separate muslims and hindus rest on different causes .
the planting of seedlings , weeding , hoeing and harvesting are all community activities here , and are performed co - operatively .
this custom is especially beneficial to the smaller and poorer farmers , whose necessary chores are thus completed on time without expense .
the thatha this is a custom prevalent in the kinnaur region and is designed to ward off the evil spirits and ghosts .
even the poorest families celebrate it once in every three or four years .
then the lama comes and performs a special pooja into the house gods , known as vikyu .
this is a custom designed to stop the spread of epidemics in a village and is prevalent in the villages along the indo - tibetan border .
and this it is which we shall explain , viz . the belief of the brahmans . . .
purusha life is the only attribute which they give to it .
the not - knowing of purusha is the cause why action comes into existence , and its knowing is the cause why action ceases .
it is dead , but has three powers potentially , not actually , which avyakta are called sattva , rajas , and tamas .
the first power is rest and goodness , and hence come existing and growing .
the second is exertion and fatigue , and hence come firmness and duration .
the third is languor and irresolution , and hence come ruin and perishing .
therefore the first power is attributed to the angels , the second to men , the third to the animals .
we have already said that , according to the belief of the hindus , the soul exists in these two places without a body .
one is this , that the cause of the agony of death is the soul ' s waiting for a shape which is to be prepared .
then the soul quits the body in which it has been staying .
( extracts from the vishnu - purana are quoted to illustrate these ideas , pp . 63 - 64 . )
" a stable condition of existence , like the condition of the plants .
this was also the opinion of the ancient greeks ; . . .
this would interrupt the continuity , and would prevent cogitation becoming united with the object of cogitation .
and this is not the object kept in view , which is , on the contrary , the continuity of cogitation .
virtuous behaviour is that which is described by the religious law .
the folklores prevalent in the area often have references to the custom .
the rana then tricked his daughter - in - law into believing that she was going to visit her father ' s house .
the canal was then completed without any further mishaps .
in hebrew they call a man who is married in this way yabham .
some people even pretend to know that all mankind , before god sent them ' his prophets , were one large idolatrous body . . .
it is ot bronze , and is nearly the size of a man .
it is now lying in the hippodrome in ghazna , together with the lord of somanath , which is a representation of the penis of mahadeva , called linga .
of somanath we shall hereafter speak in the proper place .
this cakrasvamin is said to have been made in the time of bharata as a memorial of wars connected with this name .
the brahmana are deyoted to the eight mothers , the shamanians , to buddha , to arhant the class called nagna .
the brahmins recite the veda without understanding its meaning and in the same way they learn it by heart , the one receiving it from the other .
most of them are composed in a metre called sloka .
the reason of this has already been explained . . .
the veda , however , is not composed in this common metre , sloka , but in another .
some hindus say that no one could , compose anything in the same metre .
however , their scholars maintain that this is possible indeed , but that they refrain from trying it merely from veneration for the veda .
it treats of the sacrifices to the fire , and is recited in three different ways .
first , in a uniform manner of reading , just as every other book is read .
secondly , in such a way that a pause is made after every single word .
thirdly , in a method which is the most meritorious , and for which plenty of reward in heaven is promised .
the book smnti is derived from the veda .
it is called bharata , and composed by vyasa the son of parasara at the time of the great war between the children of pandu and those of kuru .
the title itself gives an indication of those times .
after having composed the book he sent it to kashmir , but the people there did not adopt it , being in such things haughtily conservative .
the book became the fashion and highly prized .
so she went away and brought him sweetmeats .
they do not want prose compositions , although it is much easier to understand them .
other books are that of mriga - lanchana , that of pingala , and that of ( ? u ( au ) ly and ) .
the arabs are not capable of . pronouncing two vowelless consonants one after the other , but in other languages this is possible .
by these names they denote a certain conventional prosodic unity ( i . e . certain feet ) .
by meamie , i mean that laghu is reckoned = one matm , i . e . measure , andgarw = two matra .
on the ' sankranti ' day the brahmin priests visit their clients who give them alms according to their means .
there are many rituals associated with the coming of a new bride into the family .
the order in which the women unveil the bride ' s face also follows a regular pattern .
pair bandai ( touching the feet ) is another custom which helps introduce the bride to husband ' s family .
next follows a great bay in which singaldib lies , i . e . the island sarandib ( ceylon ) .
round the bay lies the city of panjayavar ( sic ) .
at present it consists of isolated mountains between which the ocean flows .
sixteen farsakh from setubandha towards the east is kihkind . the mountains of the monkeys .
and thus they go on counting , beginning anew with sunday , .
similarly , the moon is also called candra , which means the left eye of narayana , as the sun is his right eye . . . .
it applies even to the whole world , insofar as it is divided into an upper and an under part .
when they enumerate the heavens , they call the sum of them brahmanda .
the hindus , however , are devoid of training in astronomy , and have no correct astronomical notions .
further , they say the water was rolling and foaming .
then something white came ' forth from the water , of which the creator created the egg of brahman .
if they said mountains instead of rains , the matter would be somewhat more plausible .
according to others , god spoke to brahman : " i create an egg , which i make for thy dwelling in it . "
thus the water is an instrument in the hand of the creator when he wants to create something out of matter . . . .
he imagined the earth to be below and the heaven in only one of the six directions from the earth , i . e . above it .
the married women braid their hair and wear numerous pieces of jewellery denoting their married status .
they must not sit on a seat higher than the one occupied by the elders of the family .
in the extracts reproduced below such portions have been omitted .
only the geographical particulars as also those relating to the social organisation of the inhabitants of the various dvipas have been included .
it has . . . seven great ' rivers , one of which equals the ganges in purity .
saka - dvipa seven mountains adorned with jewels , some of which are inhabited by devas , others by demons .
the water bubbles up for them out of the earth , and drops down from the mountains .
they have no rains and no flowing river ; they know neither summer nor winter .
they are of one kind , without any distinction of caste .
they never suffer from dearth , and do not get old . . .
it is as if they were in a suburb of paradise . . .
according to the vishnu - pumna the inhabitants are equal among each other , not claiming any superiority . . . .
the muslims call the river , after it has passed the sindhi city aror , as a united stream , the river ofmihran .
the river sarsati falls into the sea at the distance of a bowshot east of somanath .
the river jaun joins the ganges below kanoj , which lies west of it .
the united stream falls into the great ocean near gangasagara .
behind the ganges flow the rivers rahab and kawini , which join the river sarwa near the city of ban . . . .
these are the good and bad beings through whose territories the ganges flows .
afterwards it enters into branches of the mountain vindhya , where thejelephants live , aind then it falls into the southern ocean .
if a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth , let it try .
the folk art forms are much in evidence here .
at these brisk sales there are woollen shawls and sheets , bamboo and other handicraft goods .
one of the chief features of the fair is the swimming match organized on the occasion .
this is a fair for merchants , folk dancers and gods and goddesses .
similarly throughout the whole of kinnaur fairs ( known as rasa kayang ) take place on the baisakhi day .
it is celebrated in the traditional way at the temple of trilokinath .
a horse is also taken round the temple .
after the procession , the crowd along with the horse , goes to the palace of the local ruler where the horse is given a grand welcome .
the king then rides the horse and visits the fair ground which is dotted all over with small shops .
chhetsu is yet another popular fair in the valley .
a tale about the fair is often told which links it to a ruler of ancient tibet by the name of lang darma .
many dances are performed this day to re - invoke the original one in which people dance in loose robes and masks on their faces .
this is known as the assur dance ( the dance of the devil ) .
he wastes himself thrice a day , and performs a sacrifice to the fire both at the beginning and end of the day .
after the sacrifice he worships his master .
he fasts a day and he breaks fast a day , but he is never allowed to eat meat .
washing is a cleansing from accidental impurity and a preparation for prayer .
the time when the sun declines from the meridian ( the afternoon ) is well suited for acquiring in it a heavenly reward .
therefore at this time the brahman must clean .
the evening is the time of supper and of prayer .
the brahman may take his supper and pray without having previously washed himself .
to neglect their maintenance would be a great sin .
further , he puts something aside for the cattle , the birds , and the fire .
over the remainder he says prayers and eats it .
he is not allowed to cross either of these frontiers so as to enter the country of the turks or of the karnata .
further , he must live between the ocean in the east and west .
this takes place in rampur between the 11th to the 13th of november .
the word lavi means wool .
the nalbari fair at bilaspur , and the bhikhashah fair at kangra are another major trade fairs .
these are largely cattle fairs where the punjabis and the hill - folk buy domestic cattle .
this fair takes place on the banks of the renuka lake which is the largest lake in himachal and has a circumference of some two to four kilometres .
it is surrounded on all sides with thick forests which add to its beauty .
it is the duty of the vaisya to practise agriculture and to cultivate the land , to tend the cattle and to remove the needs of the brahmans .
he is only allowed to gird himself with a single yajnopavita , which is made of two cords .
the sudra is like a servant to the brahman , taking care of his affairs and serving him .
however , the meditation on god , works of piety , and alms - giving are not forbidden to him .
once , however , a son of a brahman predeceased his father .
when she thus has wandered about through all parts of the world , she becomes food for the brahmans and for him whose property she is .
therefore most of them have been abolished , and only few of them remain and are practised nowadays .
according to the hindus , the fire eats everything .
that which the fire eats for its share , reverts to the devas , because the fire comes out of their mouths .
what the brahmans present to the fire to eat is oil and different cereals , wheat , barley , and rice which they throw into the fire .
further , they recite the prescribed texts of the veda in case they offer on their own behalf .
however , if they offer in the name of somebody else , they do not recite anything .
in multan there is a pond in which the hindus worship by bathing themselves , if they are not prevented .
we ha " ve already quoted words spoken by saunaka .
according to the same principle , god has created the worid as containing many differences in itself .
they want to live there to the end of their lives , that their reward after death should be the better for it .
therefore , the country was called after him , and venerated for his sake .
besides , taneshar is the theatre of the exploits of vasudeva in the wars of bharata and of the destruction of the evil - doers .
it is for this reason that people visit the place .
nowadays die hindus also visit kashmir .
lastly , they used to visit multan before its idol - temple was destroyed .
it is obligatory with them every day to give alms as much as possible .
the same obligation rests also on the common people , but they will always lie and cheat in the declarations about their property .
further , trading businesses , too , pay a tribute for the same reason . only the brahmans are exempt from all these taxes .
others divide ' this income into four portions .
usury or taking percentages is forbidden .
further , man makes use of its dung , and in winter - time even of its breath .
every nation has particular customs of marriage , and especially those who claim to have a religion and law of divine origin .
the law of marriage hindus marry at a very young age ; therefore the parents arrange the marriage for their sons .
husband and wife can only be separated by death , as they have no divorce .
a man may marry one to four wives .
the banquet in the sixth month must be more rich and more liberal than the others .
with the end of the year the duties towards the deceased have been fulfilled .
besides , you must know that nourishment is forbidden to the heirs for one single day in the first part of the mourning - year .
on the following day they give alms and eat .
they make the fires in sixteen different spots and in four different groups .
on the 16th they return home in this month occurs the vernal equinox , called vascmta .
they vernal equinox determine the day by calculation and make it a festival , when people invite the brahmans .
the villagers also welcome the team that had gone up the hills to look for flowers .
in the month of september the minghal fair takes place in the pangi valley .
thousands of devotees from far off villagers traverse along mountain ridges and rivers and mountain passes to come to this .
tales connected with the valiant deeds of the goddess bhagwati are recited on the occasion and the temple of the goddess is specially decorated this day .
in the night they light a great number of lamps in every place so that the air is perfectly clear .
on full moon ' s day of the same month there is another festival of 15th margasirsha the women .
on most of the days of the month pausha they prepare great quantities of puhaval ( ? ) i . e . a sweet dish which they eat .
on the eighth day of the black half , which is called sakartam , they eat turnips .
( diagrams showing the prognostics of the four fixed and seven movable karanas are given .
though they had improved upon it in some ways but ' the thing ' had become ' totally different from what it originally was . '
both the methods , that of the hindus and that of alkindi must be treated separately .
saturn , mars , and the sun , which are called kruragraha .
among the latter , they also count the dragon ' s head , though in reality it is not a star .
however , alone by itself , it is lucky .

for al - biruni ' s description of the ideas of the samkhya school of philosophers , see pp . 23 - 24 .
al - biruni mentions samkhya as a book composed by kapila ( p . 60 ) .
he had translated this book into arabic and has quoted from it extensively on matters of religion and philosophy .
festivals and feast day festivals have an important place in the lives of the people in himachal .
on a festival day the farmers do not work in the fields and rich and poor alike celebrate these to the best of their financial abilities .
the tribal festivals have their own identity which is totally different from the festival celebrated elsewhere .
it is considered auspicious to hear them utter the names of the months in the year .
yaqub ibn tariq and muhammad ibn ibrahim al - fazari were pioneers in introducing indian astronomical works to the muslim world .
muhammad ibn zakariyya alrazi ( p . 144 ) .
this is unlike al - biruni ; had he consulted some book he would have named it .
two colourful festivals are celebrated during this month .
durga is the chief deity in the area , and is supposed to protect the people from illness and mental sorrows .
there they bathe and fill small metal pots with water and come home and bathe the deities with this and offer them flowers .
on the baisakhi day ralli is brought out ceremoniously in a palanquin and taken to a river bank .
on this day the walls in the house are cleared , painted and decorated with figures of male animals and crops symbolising plenty .
the harijans are fed and the family deities are taken out into the fields where the people cook a special delicacy known as poltu .
only when these symptoms persist , appear to be severe and hamper the child ' s daily functioning should parents get worried . "
the raw data already available from the bangalore leg of the study has thrown up the figure of 1.5 per cent for adhd .
in contrast , 3 - 10 per cent of schoolkids in the west are known to suffer from adhd .
in the end it was advani , upset by suggestions that he had gone soft on autonomy , who pressured the government into calling a cabinet meeting immediately .
the centre also privately threw a lifeline to a miffed farooq by suggesting that he refer the report to the committee set up to review the constitution .
if farooq buys it , the demands of kashmir would automatically be linked to a larger debate on centre - state relations .
besides , if farooq now keeps quiet , he will give a talking point to the hurriyat conference , the very people he wanted to sideline .
the deep , dark green gave way to creamy white , almost as if an unseen hand had scattered confetti in the jungles .
in a momentous event of natural extravagance the staid bamboo groves , spread over some 3,000 hectares , came into bloom .
that ' s good news and bad news .
the good tidings first : the off - white blossoms , barely a centimetre in diameter , herald bamboo fruiting and , therefore , an abundance of food .
somewhere between barley and wheat in size , the tasty bamboo seeds contained in spiky brown balls attract man , birds and rats alike .
once the seeds are gone , the vermin swarm into nearby fields and destroy crops and often famine follows .
the considerable leaf litter on the forest floor only increases the danger .
moreover , there are culinary impediments in the way of regeneration .
cattle finish off whatever is left by human beings .
so while food may be plenty , at least for a short duration , the death of bamboo is rightly associated with famine and deprivation .
says senior advocate rajiv nayar : " the bjp promised a clean government but it is no different .
the law is not being universally applied .
why target those who have converted balconies into rooms when you have given amnesty to others ? "
the government proved it could do just that because , simply put , it is hostage to the compulsions of vote - bank politics .
jagmohan may have acquired the reputation of being a public crusader but is also a victim of similar compulsions .
he also demanded electricity and water for its inhabitants .
anant ram dairy being an unauthorised colony on public land , the occupants of the colony are illegal .
people from chamba , pangi , bharmaur , churah , and bhatiyat areas , dress up in their traditional costumes and participate in these jataras .
the sad songs about the queen ' sui ' revive old memories in the hearts of the people .
each village there celebrates it with minor local variations people cook a savoury gruel known as doon , on this day and eat it together .
the brass masks of the gods are cleaned and polished .
every fourth year a festival called bala is celebrated .
on this day old weapons belonging to the deities are brought out and cleaned .
the villagers divide themselves into two teams and play act a mock battle .
in the village the deities are taken around in their palanquins .
but then the dairy also has poorer sections which own small tenements and have been tagged along with the affluent .
and indeed none of the 1,071 colonies adheres to any law .
they have all come up without any sanction .
in 1977 , indira gandhi had taken a similar decision to regularise 676 unauthorised colonies .
it was stated then that the process would be completed only if the norms were strictly adhered to .
but 23 years on , most of these colonies are yet to meet the requirements .
everything in delhi has been taken over by unscrupulous elements including builders , government officials and their political masters . ' '
politics does seem to be the overriding factor .
despite a high court restraint , a waiver has been given with 1993 as the cut - off date .
another 400 colonies have come up since and the government will be skating on thin ice for its cut - off date is bound to be questioned .
already the congress is crying hoarse .
delhi congress chief subhash chopra wants to know why these localities should be discriminated against .
the answer again is political .
it was in 1993 that the bjp promised in its manifesto the regularisation of these localities .
the fact that the central board of direct taxes will fix the market rate is another contentious issue .
the decision taken , the government should now ready itself for a long haul on the issue .
that is the final lesson of the story .
when income - tax officials raided samata party president jaya jaitly ' s house last week they came with gunmen .
without identifying themselves they demanded to be allowed in , much in the manner robbers would .
in menacing tones , more typical of criminals than officials , they ordered her to chain her dogs .
their attitude towards her was similar , she says , to the approach policemen of a lesser kind use with criminals : guilty till proven innocent .
jaitly is a powerful personage and so was able to call a press conference and announce that the officials had demanded a bribe .
ordinary mortals would never dare do such a thing for there ' s nothing more vengeful than an indian income - tax official angered .
the problem is not new .
the reason why officials can get away with murder is that the prime minister has been hopelessly unable to bring about administrative reform .
nothing has been done to curb the powers of officials which is dangerous when you consider how quickly other things have changed .
among the things that have changed dramatically is the media .
private tv channels have made all the difference so trial by the media has become a powerful tool in the hands of the bureaucracy .
if this will not prejudice the inquiry into match - fixing it is hard to think what will .
instead , we chose as we always do the police - state methods of tax raids and cbi inquiries .
transparency in government is currently a fashionable idea .
but transparency is exactly what does not suit officials .
the only way to solve this problem is through administrative reforms that would reduce the powers of our officials .
can we begin , please , with the income - tax department ?
what about an inquiry on national tv into the methods its officials use ?
and how about a few raids on their homes to see how many have assets disproportionate to their income ?
as a special concession we can spare them the gunmen .
forcefully arguing in public against the maharashtra government ' s prosecution of shiv sena chief bal thackeray was n ' t one of them .
so what if jethmalani ' s argument was unhesitatingly upheld in the metropolitan magistrates court of mumbai ?
when it comes to thackeray , india ' s powerful liberal establishment loses sight of rationality , common sense and even the rule of law .
in a sense it is understandable that the shiv sena chief arouses such passionate hatred .
both in word and deed , he epitomises everything the liberal finds absolutely repugnant .
thackeray , it is widely acknowledged , is a blustering bully , viciously communal , intensely parochial and openly contemptuous of all democratic niceties .
to them , he is the " other " .
thackeray is n ' t some shadowy creature of the night , a mogambo - type don who hides behind concealed doors and secret passages .
without exaggeration , thackeray is mumbai ' s first citizen .
sanjay dutt took his help in getting out of a sticky situation and lara dutta made matoshri her first port of call in mumbai .
thackeray , it would seem , constitutes the ultimate stamp of legitimacy and approval .
so , why this bewildering hypocrisy ?
why must those who organise photo opportunities of beauty queens utilise the occasion to surreptitiously whisper to the prime minister that arresting thackeray would be a good idea ?
often , it is believed , evil spirits and ghosts get into the palanquin and increase the weight suddenly .
many dances are also performed with ancient historical weapons ,
minjar among the monsoon festivals one of the most colourful ones is minjar .
the family priests also go to the houses of their patrons ( yajman ) and tie rakhi on their wrists , thus blessing them .
the priest is also given gifts of money and food grains .
the rakhi threads are spun out of cotton and dyed in red .
it represents , not a specific area , but a whole group of dialects .
dr . grierson in his book calls it a sub - branch of the aryan language and says that it is spoken in most of the himachal area .
the area of this dialect extends from bhadrawah in northern punjab , to nepal .
the natives of the area were the khasas , the kiratas and the kinnars .
the word kirat itself stands or a hill tribe .
traces of the kirta language are still available in the malana village of kallu district .
it is spoken by over three lakh people .
outer siraji , inner siraji and sainji are its sub - dialects .
during the period of the feudal states , it was written in the takkri script .
kinnauri this is commonly spoken in the kinnaur region .

such couplets show the effect of the bhramara geet tradition of the bhakti poetry .
a beloved separated from her lover expresses her sorrow to a date tree thus :
the kingdom without the king , the sick ones without the doctor and the wife without the husband , roam the earth restlessly .
the ballads of nankhoo gaddan and maina chamyan are based on this .
someone has cast a spell on my child ,
one popular form runs thus :
the themes of these songs are numerous , ranging from songs of fun to songs of fear and love .
the winters are a slack season here when working in the fields or forests or by the rivers is impossible .
for two or three uionths the people sit indoors by the fireside regarding each other with tales .
he kills the serpent king across the hills and also the demon guarding princess roopkesi and brings her home .
the tale of the blind man and the hunchback describes these two friends living together .
similarly the stupid weaver gives all the wrong answers and yet is rewarded by the king .
as in the past , jury members were not unanimous in their verdict and often votes had to be cast to separate the winners from the losers .
the division was further accentuated when four films which had been rejected in the initial rounds but were subsequently recalled went on to bag some of the prestigious awards .
" there were clearly pressure groups building up , " claims an angry krishen .
says raut : " it ' s a joke to call it the president ' s awards . "
both bali , a former congress mp who is now with the bjp , and information and broadcasting minister sushma swaraj rubbish the dissenters ' version .
a . he is one of the seniormost leaders in our state and he has been given due respect .
q . most of the top leaders and former ministers of the previous udf government face charges of corruption .
one has even been sent to jail .
wo n ' t this affect the udf ' s prospects ?
a . most of the cases were cooked up by the ldf and are politically motivated .
people know this .
q . the congress in kerala has been keeping a strange silence on the tehelka . com expose .
so is there a deal with the bjp ?
a . this is a usual shibboleth of the cpi ( m ) .
no place appears safe .
" in my experience , there has been a 10 to 15 per cent annual increase in monkey bites , " says gautam .
" and if concrete steps are not taken soon , the percentage is likely to double . "
why this sudden anger of the primates against people ?
they say you made billions and built palaces .
is this true ?
during my first term , islam , not in religious terms , was used against me .
when that failed , the bogey of corruption was raised .
but the reality is that india copied my energy and software policies .
q . what about your properties that have been listed ?
a . what properties ?
q . it seems musharraf is soft towards you .
a . they have kept my husband in jail and you think like this ?
a . you know , the whole thing is run by zia ' s men .
q . is there a compromise with the general ?
i have deputed the vice - chairman of the party and said that if there are talks he should join in .
but dialogues have led us nowhere because they do n ' t want the return of benazir .
they want to use the army against me .
a . i will choose musharraf any day .
q . musharraf wants a democratic face and where will they find a better one than yours ?
a . i am hearing this from you .
if they want such a face , they have not come to me .
and let me tell you , i am not only a democratic face , i am a person with her own base .
q . but if they keep women confined to the four walls and in purdah , how will you fight ?
a . this is a challenge .
in my life , i have accepted challenges .
q . do you think islamic fundamentalism is standing in the way of a negotiated settlement ?
a . in my days , the hurriyat was prominent in kashmir .
now the lashkar - e - toiba has come in .
we can sit and talk about how to manage this .
we understand violence should end and our countries should live in peace .
i am prepared to play my role .
q . but you can play a role only if you go to pakistan .
q . if you have to choose between family and politics , what will you do ?
but what is the legal community ' s verdict on judicial activism ?
" there has to be a better way to introduce cng , " agrees supreme court lawyer indira jaisingh .
" it ' s difficult to guess why the court must stick to the last date when it causes grief to so many . "
the issue has also reopened the debate over whether the apex court is encroaching upon the executive ' s turf .
senior supreme court lawyer b . l . vadehra is incensed at those who point fingers at the apex court .
reacting to dikshit ' s words he says , " it is a dishonest stand taken by the chief minister .
they had three years , but could not deliver . "
raval withdrew from the state ' s case after its defiant remarks .
says raval : " people ' s faith resides in the judiciary and it should not come under attack . "
it ' s a reflection of popular perceptions in a country where the judiciary is vested with parental authority .
" if the government does not cooperate you cannot lay the blame for citizens ' suffering at the court ' s door , " he says .
the stage is now set for a potentially damaging confrontation .
on republic day this year , nadeesh kodrani , 12 , walked on this street in anjar with hundreds of his schoolmates . . .
then the earth shook and for 150 of them , it was their last walk on this planet .
last wednesday , nandeesh walked on the same street with a man who was till the other day the most powerful politician on earth .
william jefferson clinton , the man who walked with nandeesh , is good at telegenic memorial services .
an enchanter who knows how to win hearts and influence minds .
the moment the casually dressed clinton stepped out of a navy - blue cherokee , the atmosphere got electrified .
" i hope he will really help us to rebuild our houses , " said nandeesh .
clinton was instrumental in the formation of the aif .
it all started when his office contacted victor menezes , chairman and ceo of citibank , with the idea .
aif wants to tap private , corporate and academic resources for the rehabilitation of 100 villages in kutch .
what quake - hit gujarat saw on that sweltering wednesday was an intimate prelude to that .
no air - conditioned limos for the travellers in the " mutilated landscape " , only non - ac minibuses .
so , imagine this .
women wielding lathis swathed in gold foil and flowers .
women marching through the streets , daring the 50,000 men watching in awe from their rooftops , to arouse their animosity .
hours after drinking in the unaccustomed freedom , purohit admitted that she would love to lead " such a life the entire year " .
now , however , women veer towards contemporary royalty .
they take three to four rounds of a four - kilometre stretch alongside which are placed 15 idols .
the women adorn the idols with personal offerings of gold jewellery .
it is said that in some groups , the widow performs the ritual in the nude .
which explains why the men ensure they stay behind closed doors prior to and after the procession .
india : border security force ( bsf ) in the north - east sector the bsf has 50 battalions totalling 50,000 men .
the 1974 india - bangladesh border agreement was signed to settle such disputes .
in december 2000 , foreign secretaries of the two countries agreed to set up two joint working groups to demarcate the boundary and exchange enclaves .
while india has sent terms of reference for the groups , bangladesh has not replied .
she has been quick to defuse the tension , but has held back from offering an apology .
with parliamentary elections due this year , the retreat from pyrdiwah , or padua as bangladesh calls it , was considered a let down .
" we will continue to negotiate on padua through diplomatic channels and at flag meetings , " said foreign secretary syed muazzam ali .
but was the episode over ?
in the process , she has lost much of the public support she once enjoyed .
if the border situation flares up again , and if bangladeshi lives come under threat or are lost , the sentiment could change .
zia ' s description of hasina as being " subservient " to india could be taken far more seriously then .
signs that india may be massing troops on the border are cause for concern .
no one wants to tangle with india .
but at the same time , pride in being bangladeshi rides very high .
the assistance given by india in 1971 will never be forgotten .
but bangladeshis would like their gratitude to be a matter of choice , not of compulsion .
buy a child for a paltry sum from the tribal backwoods .
being maharashtrian brahmins , the first three rss chiefs - k . b .
sudarshan ' s topsy - turvy relationship with the bjp leadership , particularly with prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , is well known .
as early as march 1998 , even before he became the rss chief , sudarshan had vetoed jaswant singh ' s nomination as finance minister .
that was only the early skirmish .
unfortunately , the battlelines have been clearly drawn on economic reforms .
they argue that withdrawal of the state from the economic process amounts to surrendering the country to big business and foreigners .
and because they supposedly speak for the poor their voice gets heard more .
in the process , the voice of the real poor - hawkers , rickshawallahs , vendors , weavers , small farmers - has gone unheard .
the csds conference was the first attempt to make it heard .
attending were not only luminaries like m . s . swaminathan , sharad joshi and anil aggarwal but also ordinary people .
they may not understand the meaning of liberalisation but understand well the meaning of government interference in their lives .
rickshawallahs talked about the problems they face trying to eke out a living in the face of constant harassment from officialdom and the police .
perplexed , the nuns come out in ones and twos .
the church he belongs to - the syrian orthodox - as indeed most other denominations in the state , have traditionally been anti - communist and pro - congress .
it has declared its opposition to the may 10 elections to assam ' s 126 - member assembly .
between april 4 and may 2 as many as 34 people were killed and 129 injured in election - related violence .
the congress , of course , refuted the charges .
the story was similar in marxist west bengal where 51 per cent said there had been no change and 25 per cent said it had worsened .
from tamil nadu we heard 56 per cent say that their lives remained unchanged and 20 per cent that it had worsened .
so does it make any difference who wins ?
besides , there was nothing in her campaign directed at " marxist misrule " that indicated that she would come up with a new style of governance .
it is hard not to be cynical about the phase that indian politics is passing through .
hard not to ask if there is any point in voting when our choice is between bad and worse .
jayalalitha has proved that she is not just corrupt but irresponsible as well .
remember the tantrums that brought down the previous vajpayee government .
the 125 - year - old chemistry department was instrumental in manufacturing tnt during world war ii .
" the production plant in the cellar , now corroded , has many war tales to tell , " remarks v . kannappan , a chemistry professor .
presidency ' s chemistry labs have contributed to heads as much as warheads .
amrutanjan balm was formulated here in the 1960s .
started by eyre burton powell in 1840 , the college became autonomous in 1987 .
fees are as low as rs 1,000 per semester , making the college much sought among bright students from economically backward families .
continuous assessment of students ' performance and end - semester examinations form the basis for awarding degrees .
perhaps it is the will to excel in challenging circumstances that makes the college click .
for students who cannot afford private tuitions , the teachers spend extra hours taking special classes .
last year , too , presidency students came first in all the science subjects in tamil nadu .
presidency college is an example of the fact that quality education need not cost the moon .
it is a monument to ability and effort , which are the qualities that make good scientists .
presidency ' s nearest rival has a lot in common with it .
loyola , another chennai college , was started in july 1925 by a group of jesuits .
priests from the order still run it with religious dedication .
" we put equal emphasis on all - round development of the student , " says principal fr joseph xavier .
loyola has made computer education compulsory for all its students .
social work is also part of the loyola student ' s campus life .
specialised research institutes which are a part of loyola include the entomology research institute and the loyola institute of frontier energy .
it offers seven undergraduate courses in the sciences and allied subjects , including one on visual communication .
the world according to delhi university is split into two races : those who are in stephen ' s and the rest .
stephen ' s is one of the few colleges where the tutorial system actually works , where teachers pay individual attention to students .
there ' s also a school of music and a strong student - run placement cell .
students are encouraged to take a shot at activities - academic and otherwise - even outside india .
the first batch will be graduating this year .
professor j . l . gupta , who has been the principal since 1996 , says the management here would like to bring in many more such changes .
however , the college will ultimately have to function within the regulatory framework prescribed by the university grants commission , which could limit the possibilities .
but the college does have a fully automated library and computer centre and even a swimming pool .
several well - known names figure in the alumni list .
some rival colleges , however , remain unconvinced .

fifty - nine people - many of them women and children - died because of the criminal negligence of the cinema management and the delhi government .
the trial is proceeding so slowly that even the process of recording evidence is nowhere near complete .
of the 170 witnesses , only four have given evidence so far .
in the uphaar case , we had a list of alleged culprits from day one , but that does not appear to have helped our courts move faster .
nor have they been affected by the public importance of the case .
well , according to him , he has already suggested amendments to the civil procedure code which should be approved in the next session of parliament .
when implemented they should reduce the period of a civil trial to less than a year .
the amendments seek to make it possible for courts to use modern methods of communication - instead of just postmen - to serve notices .
also , there is a proposal to make it compulsory - except in unusual circumstances - for judgements to be delivered within 30 days .
but civil cases are only a third of the problem since two - thirds of the cases in indian courts are criminal .
here , the problem is more complicated so an expert committee has been appointed to suggest changes .
so can we hope to see real change in the justice system soon ?
he adds that he has now told his colleagues as well as officials that they must strictly adhere to rules and not exceed their briefs .
she had even made plans to hold the swearing - in ceremony of her cabinet in the open air on brigade parade ground .
that ' s shorthand for her re - entry into the union cabinet .
on the rebound , she went to the congress .
before cosying up to the congress mamata was an anti - left crusader .
today she ' s the leader of a small gang of seven mps in the lok sabha whose allegiance she claims to steer .
even this claim taxes credibility .
except sudip bandhopadhyay , a family friend of mamata , none of the remaining mps will play with the " b - team . "
if it happens , the left - bashing bonaparte of bengal will be headed for quite a ridiculous ending .
after a two - month break , he recently returned to 10 janpath at the behest of sonia gandhi .
wildlife experts , ngos and forest officials are vehemently opposing the project .
and not without reason .
the trains on the line routinely run over animals that stray onto the tracks .
in mahananda , garumara and jaldapara , the train tracks also pass through rhinoceros and bison corridors .
as a result , these animals often find themselves face to face with a train .
since 1992 , at least 13 elephants and a rhinoceros have been run over .
" what will happen when they run a rajdhani ? " he asks .
indo - pakistan romanticism could not have taken a more topographically silly leap .
is it what india wants the summit to be - more spectacular and less substantial ?
some far - fetched symbolism instead of no - nonsensical business ?
a provincial pageantry instead of national purposefulness ?
really , a classical case of bungling before the beginning .
in short , the plot should be subordinated to the setting .
it should not have happened - making this summit prematurely " monumental " .

the irony is that such a provision militates against the seventh schedule of the constitution , which puts the police on top of the state list of subjects .
such a law will , therefore , not stand constitutional scrutiny .
regional togetherness - as in eu or asean or oic or the hopeless saarc - does n ' t translate itself into o - brother bonhomie .
national exceptionalism does n ' t dissolve in supranational idealism .
the alternative to peace is not war but pragmatism .
something that is absent in indo - pak engagement .
india and pakistan cannot be equal partners , for they are incompatible as nation states .
whatever may be its imperfections , india is an evolved democracy with the institutions of civil society strongly in place .
and the lurking enemy is a prerequisite for any supreme leadership .
for jayalalitha , the enemy appears in many cunning forms - an old man in dark glasses , a tv camera .
but supreme leaders do n ' t punish themselves .
that privilege belongs to the masses .
they are indian fashion ' s guns for hire .

bangalore : karnataka chief minister s . m . krishna is on an austerity drive .
the state is reeling under drought and he has appealed to the centre for relief .
he recently became the first chief minister to pick up hyundai ' s latest luxury sedan , the rs 14 - lakh sonata .
a source close to krishna says " he has a taste for the elegant things in life " .
certainly .
investigations exposed the usual tale of bribery , chicanery and corruption .
this kind of thing happens too often for foreign investors to be madly enthusiastic about our wondrous country .
if it were on the road to completion we could at least be cheerful .
alas , the road ahead is long and untravelled and there is no sign that this government is even taking its first steps along it .
so we remember you dr manmohan singh but we remember you with gloom gathering around us .
spread over an area of 8,325 sq km in the bay of bengal , these island territories have been known for exotic turtles and virgin tropical forests .
the sea lanes are vital for india ' s energy security as it is also looking for oil and gas supplies from myanmar and vietnam .
by creating an infrastructure for deployment of larger forces at port blair , delhi is sending a signal that its area of interests extends up to the malacca straits .
the andaman sea has become a cause of concern for delhi with gun - runners , narco - traffickers and pirates operating with impunity .
the anc gives the country the opportunity to defend well away from our coastline .
according to him , the anc has been created as there was a need to maintain self - sufficient forces under a unified command .
personally for the prime minister , it must be a moment of existential revelation .
to some extent , he may have been let down by situations .
but that cannot be the whole truth .
he continues to be the most popular politician in india .
the so - called philosopher king who could rise above the stereotypes of his own party .
larger than his party , vajpayee has that image of not being subordinated to realpolitik .
that vajpayee looks so remote from today ' s vajpayee .
this is more than his personal loss .
the government stake in it is the least of the three big fis and its ratio of npas to loans is the lowest .
ironically , the poor performance of uti and ifci is being taken as an excuse to unleash babus into the boardrooms of fis .
uti already has a bureaucrat as its head . ifci too is likely to have one once its present chairman goes .
but this cure is worse than the disease .
as the single largest party , with 180 mps in the lok sabha , it is almost pre - determined that the new leader will be from the bjp .
" we have elephants from as far away as south bengal . "
that ' s how tarzan landed up here .
pickers heard a calf crying all night and contacted the orphanage .
now both well - behaved youngsters are favourites with the orphanage ' s staff .
" tarzan is going to be a very good patrol elephant , " says keeper raghubir chhetri , with the air of a proud papa .
" he ' s only seven and he ' s already over 7 ft tall . "
the privileges committee of the lok sabha also issued notice to the police officers to appear before it in parliament .
muthukaruppan , who took over after jayalalitha ' s appointment as chief minister , is allegedly the brain behind the surprise arrest of karunanidhi .
the other two have been accused of " manhandling " karunanidhi and roughing up his supporters , union ministers murasoli maran and t . r . baalu .
in his bid to show loyalty to amma , muthukaruppan even wrote to sun tv , ordering it to stop the repeated telecasts of the arrest episode .
soon after the incident , the union government had given a directive to the state government to take action against the police officers .
so the requisitioning order was arguably interpreted in fort st george as retaliatory .
when the punjab chief minister says chandigarh should be part of punjab is it an antinational demand ? "
kaushal ' s defence of the naga demand was drowned in the usual parliamentary interruptions .
his arguments were convincing .
but they had come a little too late and had few takers .
a couple of days ahead of the monsoon session of parliament , the government took the risk of throwing the gains of the cease - fire to the winds .
the naga leaders took the bad news in their stride .
this was not the first time in the last four years of the cease - fire pact that the government had failed to keep its word .
the issue of a cease - fire without territorial limits had been hanging fire since 1997 .
the nscn leaders appreciated the fact that at least this time round , the government had agreed in principle to its demand .
it could not honour its commitment because of extraneous reasons .
" they first complained about cease - fire violations by the security forces .
the government , of course , could not refrain from making an announcement .
it had to restore normalcy in manipur .
the announcement provoked a terse denial from the nscn ( i - m ) .
the necessity of keeping the rampant activities of the indian armed forces under effective control was first and foremost .
of course , both sides believed that better understanding could certainly be arrived at in the course of talks .
there is practically no point in the government making any announcement beyond this understanding . "
it dubbed any statement or declaration made by the home ministry as unfounded and unacceptable to the nagas .
the naga response confused the northeastern states .
if the amendment to the truce pact as announced by advani was not acceptable to the nscn ( i - m ) would it retreat to the jungles ?
was it the end of peace in the region ?
would the security forces have to resume anti - insurgency operations ?
fears of nscn ' s return to violence worried manipur ' s leaders the most .
imphal politicians , who were critical of keeping the state assembly in suspended animation , no longer minded the government ' s decision to dissolve the house .
" elections should not be held soon , " says former chief minister radha binod koijam .
in india we are more democratic about these things one has to work your way up almost from the peon upwards .
triggered by the boom in public issues , uti clearly was drawn in by the euphoria on equity .
the sudden inflow of equity saw us - 64 ' s equity component rise from 26 per cent to 67 per cent .
the seven - year return on ril shares is only 92 per cent .
theoretically , uti could have sold off all or a large part of its ril holdings and made a killing .
it is another matter though that stock markets could have gone into a tailspin with such large - scale offloading of shares .
it was not stephen hawking who was objecting .

it offended every canon of the country ' s projected self - image .
it was amoral , unflinching , imperious and made a virtue of expediency .
it was the idiom of ruthlessness that was personified by indira gandhi .
nearly 17 years after her death , the memory of indira is intact in the popular imagination .
the choice does n ' t stem from longevity of tenure alone .
history is n ' t assessed either in a vacuum or on the strength of moral absolutes .
it is entirely a function of the present .
indira was n ' t about ideology .
her socialism that had the fellow travellers crawling as cheer - leaders was only peripherally grounded in a vision .
it was entirely an instrument of control .
from the treasury to the judiciary and from cm to dm she stood for personalised autarchy .
autonomy , today ' s buzzword , did n ' t exist in her lexicon .
she did n ' t care to " manage " contradictions , only manipulate them when expedient and suppress them when timely .
she had no permanent allies , only a heightened sense of self - interest .
she would use jarnail singh bhindranwale to outflank the akalis and trigger operation bluestar when he got out of hand .
if she was uncompromisingly secular in 1972 , she was unabashedly hindu a decade later .
she had the ability to keep friends and foes alike in a state of permanent anticipation .
the women were selling the game brought home by their hunter husbands .
it seemed strange coming from a man belonging to a family of hunters .
but choudhury ' s interest in wildlife has always been of another kind .
after writing impassioned essays on the environment for his college magazine choudhury started writing seriously in 1977 .
by the early 1980s he had embarked on a study of the northeast ' s rich fauna .
he wrote in the local dailies and conducted baseline surveys in the bordoibam bird sanctuary and the east karbi anglong sanctuary .
" today , with access to the internet , even my home is like a laboratory , " says choudhury .
to reach the masses he produced low - cost posters in various dialects during his many postings in the outlying districts of assam .
his involvement with different organisations also helped enlarge the scope of his efforts .
this group of well - wishers furnished the staff with basic amenities and with wireless communication facilities , motorcycles and motorboats .
the result : rhino poaching in kaziranga has come down from more than 25 a year till 1996 to less than 10 now .
choudhury ' s travels have enabled him to act the good samaritan in other ways too .
ten years ago he came across sarsing rongphar , a 50 - year - old karbi tribal who killed wild animals and sold their flesh for a living .
choudhury persuaded rongphar to give up hunting and got him a job with the forest department .
another interesting encounter was with the priest of the lumpo gompha in tawang , arunachal pradesh .
some of choudhury ' s enthusiasm rubbed on lama pema , the priest , and today his posters adorn the walls of the monastery .
pema , an artist himself , now paints birds and animals to educate villagers about their surroundings .
choudhury has to his credit some authoritative works on the wilds of the northeast .
he will talk peace with the nasty neighbour but he will crush crossborder jehadis .
he wants to eliminate poverty from this country and he wants the nasty neighbourhood leader to eliminate poverty from his country .
and , he is serious , a rapid action force will ensure that next year is the " implementation year " .
an action force driven by leadership vision .
do n ' t worry , you will have more of it on august 15 , 2002 .
the day after the dmk ' s shirtless display of agony in parliament the national headlines were full of shock .
as if it was the first dramatic performance of dravidian politics .
maybe first time inside parliament .
much of the ground work for the project is done .
the cabinet has also approved tolling of all national highways and legal wrangles in land acquisition have been sorted by amending relevant laws .
but national highways account for just 2 per cent of total roads in india .
and it is in improving the state highways and smaller roads that khanduri ' s skills will be put to the test .
having inherited the vision and the means , khanduri has to bulldoze when his way to implementation .
for a state disfigured by a decade of violence , rights violation in kashmir is beginning to approach the manic radicalism of the taliban .
on august 8 , two young women in downtown srinagar were splashed with acid .
their crime : not only were they wearing make - up but they were also without veils .
says hizb - ul mujahideen spokesman salim hashmi : " these are anti - movement forces out to undermine our armed struggle . "
militants , however , deny the charge .
" the dress code is on our agenda , but it is not a priority , " says lashkar - e - toiba spokesman abu osama .
" at present , our objective is to secede from india . "
those efforts had come to a naught .
it ' s rare to find a bigger misfit between the beliefs of a minister and the demands of his ministry .
sharad yadav and the civil aviation ministry are just not made for each other .
they have only become worse - a state of collapse which disinvestment minister arun shourie believes is being encouraged " to benefit one private airline " .
it ' s a serious charge and one that implies an ailing psu is being wilfully kept sick to benefit competition .
the excuse of pending privatisation has been used to sit on long overdue decisions , critical for the viability of ia and a - i .
lease of four aircraft for ia under discussion since 1999 .
a - i ' s fleet expansion is in a limbo .
the airlines fleet shrunk to just 23 , before two planes were inducted this year .
caught between a still - born disinvestment and non - infusion of funds , the airlines are limping .
besides , a report by the planning commission and the export import policy for 2001 has also underlined the need for amendment .
that the ministry has been bypassed is evident .
the present law makes it mandatory to provide drinking water in earthen pots , while making the installation of a water cooler illegal .
but jatiya ' s vision falls short of even these baby steps .
the question is : why is he being retained in this job ?
his amendments to maintenance laws ( for women divorcees ) would make it mandatory for judgements to be delivered within 60 days .
jaitley is also ready with sweeping changes in property laws and those related to consumer courts , accident claims and land acquisition .
parliament is another source of delay .
the amended cpc has n ' t even been discussed in parliament as the standing committee has n ' t given its report yet .
but all this has n ' t deterred jaitley .
" a minister ' s job is to provide a vision and lead from the front , " he says .
that ' s a claim not often heard these days .
delhi : the moving power of big business is not to be trifled with .
the nouveau - popular royal is also composing music with ali for dev anand ' s love in times square .
and then he has his own pop album .
working out of his studio at amir mahal in chennai ' s raucous royapettah suburb , he says , " music is my passion and now profession . "
he ' s lucky he met lucky .
this is the sholay of all plays . "
when the debate becomes about education and not politics we might see that " saffronisation " is the least of our problems .
if journalism is the pursuit of truth , the tehelka tapes have captured the naked truth .
and if every method is acceptable to reach the truth , those tapes have no doubt taught indian journalism one or two morality lessons .
then , the merciless hidden camera , journalism ' s risky romance , was worth the truth .
now , one more set of images - part pornography , part inducement , part honeytrap - is out .
from the tehelka team ' s point of view , it is all in the name of truth - a little sex service for the larger social service .
if journalism requires an unwritten code of ethics , only journalists , no one else , are qualified to enforce it .
the investigative spirit of the tehelka camera has gone beyond the limits of responsibility . in spite of the naked truth .
the subjects are too sensitive to be generalised - one moral , the other national .
but the face - off between human rights and national security has taken a kind of political turn .
the interesting thing is , his detractors too have a point : national duty does n ' t mean you are above the law .
and do n ' t overlook a stark reality : in every struggle there is one recurring adjective - national .
the majority of pieces in the collection show the aesthetic vestiges of the mughal legacy .
says ananth kumar , union minister of tourism and culture : " the nizam ' s treasury was unfathomable .
what you ' ll see is but a small sample of it . "
initially not many took the rumours of mahanta ' s alleged second marriage seriously .
she sticks to her story , although pravin aacharya , the priest at the temple , says he had not performed any wedding that day .
bharali is married too , to monideep das , a veterinarian , and has a 12 - year - old son .
" this is a political conspiracy by the congress to jeopardise my political and family life , " mahanta told india today .
" i lead a happy family life with my wife and three children . "
over the years , his image has taken a beating .
at a heated agp executive meeting on august 21 , mahanta said , " i ' m not guilty .
the truth will emerge soon . "
sources say members of the executive committee are likely to resign en masse to enable the party to elect a new committee , including a new president .
even if he is elected president again , mahanta will find it hard to lead the party .
his father devakanta mahanta was quoted as saying , " how will prafulla face the masses again ?
it ' s up to him to clear his name . "
he filed a petition challenging the builders and the state forest department for being hand - in - glove with them .
at the same time , another birdwatcher , sandip brahmbhatt , also approached the court .
padhya and brahmbhatt , who painstakingly gathered facts on the lake , produced satellite pictures that showed the presence of a lake .
the judgement has now brought into focus the dubious role of government agencies like the forest department and urban development authorities .
" most of the ngos proved to be nothing but paper tigers , " says the campaigner .
for one , he is a chief minister who has not won a popular election .
in fact , he has not even contested one , preferring the safe route through the hardwar - dehradun graduate constituency seat in the uttar pradesh legislative council .
it was a stroke of luck and old - fashioned factional politics in the bjp that catapulted him to the chair .
but in nearly 10 months in office , swami has little to show by way of governance .
his unconventional ways have amused many but rattled his party leadership .
at the moment , the septuagenarian does not inspire confidence .
as chief minister , his style and schedules are unique .
complainants even get to meet him .
when swami is unusually busy , he makes sure one of his officers is deputed .
most visitors come away with the feeling they have got a fair deal .
a congress mla , indira hridiyesh recently went on record that no congress chief minister had been as helpful to her as swami was .
swami has good links with almost all parties .
but we had no money to support them till a corporate finally bailed us out . "
there is criticism also that the unconventional venues have taken away the ambience and form of true theatre , rendering the audience a " lazier " lot .
but the new tribe is dismissive .
its elaborate probe into defence deals was holding up arms purchases , he declared .
" too many ministry files are lying with the commission . "
the defence ministry was obliged to deny that the delay was affecting its purchases .
the nda ' s complaint about the slow progress has not gone well with lawyers and the commission either .
he is confident that the panel would complete its work by november 25 .
the two commissions led by justice j . s . verma and justice d . p . wadhwa in which he worked had completed their work almost on schedule .
the government , however , sees no specific links between the spycam revelations and the defence deals .
as a remedial measure additional solicitor - general kirit raval has suggested certain procedural changes to quicken the pace of work .
once the hearings are made public , fernandes and his friends will have less to gripe about .
for the moment , it is turning out to be a case of justice delayed and political gains denied for the samata chief .
this has made the local population - egged on by various sadhus , mostly from uttar pradesh and bihar - prefer chhattisgarh more .
q . now that you have got your dream portfolio of telecommunications , what are your immediate plans ?
a . convergence is now a reality in india .
the relationship between information technology and telecom is that of the soul and body .
if we are to ensure india ' s global dominance in information technology , we have to develop telecommunications at super speed .
that is my immediate task .
q . does this mean you will ensure faster privatisation of this sector ?
the disinvestment process will be expedited .
i will see to it that the disinvestment in both the vsnl and the mtnl takes place as soon as possible .
they began to walk back when they heard the second blast .
this time it was the south tower that was on fire .
a second plane had struck and rekhi was beginning to panic .
he ran towards the towering inferno looking for his wife amid a confused , chaotic and terrified mass .
he was stuck in the wtc complex when the south tower began to crumble some 45 minutes later .
he began to run , part of a concourse of humanity rushing away from the crashing steel , concrete and balls of fire .
" i saw somebody jump from god knows which floor .
bodies were flying like pinballs . "
across america , the reaction was swift .
in city after city , the downtown areas were cleared out .
the 110 - storeyed sears tower in chicago was evacuated as a precautionary measure .
schools ended early , people drove home .
they were distraught , searching for answers .
simmering deep within was a rage for revenge .
the vox pops on radio stations and tv channels were seething .
also , they tend to group together .
bin laden ' s international islamic front for jehad against the us and israel brings together nearly a dozen islamic terrorist groups .
terrorism is the core component of pakistan ' s proxy war against india .
even though the international law gives us the right of active defence against pakistan , we have not exercised it even once .
sadly , our political leadership lacks the determination to use the capability of our intelligence agencies in national interests , irrespective of international pressures .
there has been a mushrooming of intelligence - sharing mechanisms , but the agencies can only supply intelligence to the political leaderships .

ballimaran street in delhi ' s chandni chowk is a squalid , narrow lane only wide enough for a small car .
yet , a seamless traffic of men , beasts and old , rickety rickshaws push through it every day .
groaning grey tenements and matchbox - sized hardware shops , some over a hundred years old , line the dirt road on either side .
the only relief is babu ram churiwala ' s bangle shop . you wo n ' t miss it even if you wink .
it ' s a colour riot .
all the hues of the rainbow spill over on to the grey street from the little shop , no more than 4 ft wide .
every day , his wife , three daughters and son crowd into a room in his ancestral house in old delhi and make bangles .
" churis are back in vogue , " says ram .
today ' s teenager does not mind wearing it with her denim jeans . "
he thinks it is necessary to give his bangles nicknames and constantly innovate to keep customers happy .
some of them are named after hindi films : chandni , yaadein , lagaan , souten , the list goes on .
a four - piece set comes for rs 100 .
he even has " blood sugar bangles " bearing stones with magnetic properties and meant to be worn against the pulse .
as chief of intelligence in the national guard , i had been warned but could n ' t save many family members and friends .
our army , a 120 - year - old institution , was destroyed and along with many other officers , i had to leave the country .
i arrived in delhi in 1992 and i do n ' t think i ' ll be going home any time soon .
sometimes these days i think i will go mad .
speak to any woman who has known the fulfilment that a career brings , and she will tell you she understands me .
we were a rich family with four houses in afghanistan .
for almost five years till april 1992 , i worked as an accountant with the afghanistan chamber of commerce in kabul .
i ' ve worked from the age of 17 , a year after i got married .
for nine years now i have been unemployed .
i worry about my education going to waste .
how do i explain to you the extent of freedom that we women had in afghanistan ?
i have never known the burqa .
i was educated in an all - girls ' school in kabul .
college was co - ed , like most other colleges in the city .
there were parties all the time , with music and dancing , just the way they are in india .
that poor young bride ' s hands were chopped off as punishment by the taliban .
the mujahideen came to power in april 1992 , and i came to india that december .
but even those intervening months of strictures were depressing .
there were explosions all around .
the men who had come from pakistan would trouble women on the streets , go into offices and houses and misbehave .
with the taliban - who are all men from pakistan - it is worse .
since women are not allowed to work , female doctors ca n ' t practise .
but a woman is not allowed to go to a male doctor when she is ill .
what are her choices ?
see a woman doctor , if she is lucky to have one as a neighbour , or die .
no one cares anyway .
the thought had touched chandra ' s heart and signalled a mission that is continuing throughout his life .
chandra ' s passion stems from his concern about the dearth of voluntary donors in government hospitals .
sixty per cent of this is used by developed countries , which comprise only 17 per cent of the world ' s population .
this means the remaining 83 per cent of the people spread across the developing nations have access to just 40 per cent of the blood pool .
and in 43 per cent of the cases , the blood is not tested for transmissible diseases .
figures at his fingertips , chandra began to convince healthy individuals to do their bit to overcome the country ' s shortage of the crucial body fluid .
at present , although this requirement is being met , there are doubts about its purity as half of it is obtained from professional donors .
estimates suggest that ' s the trend in most third world countries , with 30 per cent coming from replacement , and 20 per cent from voluntary donors .
chandra is in touch with health authorities in every state , and has sought government support for his campaign .
last fortnight , it looked as if the front could overwhelm the taliban ' s army even before the big war .
the taliban quickly regained lost ground and showed it could hold its own .
it became apparent that without military intervention by the us and its allies , the front would not be able to defeat the taliban .
its leaders softened their tone towards a us action .
in an interview to india today in dushanbe , the capital of neighbouring tajikistan , abdullah admitted , " a big war is now certain .
we need the help of the global community so that the time taken to liberate afghanistan is far less . " ( see interview )
and whatever his plans , he will have to set them in motion quickly .
some girls even wore really short skirts .
our tailors would get albums from paris and style clothes along those lines .
only about 10 per cent of the women wore burqas in those days , and most of them were really old or lived in the villages .
i read in the papers that a woman in afghanistan cannot be seen outside the house with a man other than a relative , according to a taliban decree .
so today , a husband and wife in my country cannot leave home without their nikahnama .
a brother and sister had better carry their passports .
the moral police could ask for proof any time .
a refugee who recently left afghanistan told us the tragic story of a wedding held just a few months back .
her fingers - knuckles up - adorned with mehndi , accidentally peeped out of her burqa at one point .
he says the problem lies in the fact that collection of blood through voluntary donations constitutes a minuscule percentage of the total requirement in the country .
the woman believed that giving blood would make her husband impotent .
but first he had to get his own facts right .
so he began to gather data on the demand and availability of blood in the country and the problems the banks faced .
he discussed the matter with people who worked in the field , including world health organisation ( who ) officials .
the statistics , he found , did n ' t make for a healthy graph .
chandra has no illusions .
he knows convincing people will take time .
he talks of how his mother initially had reservations about his donating blood .
but she came around when he explained the scarcity of pure blood .
a scarcity he is determined to overcome .
uma bharati ducks into the cockpit .
her fear of flying has forced her to travel in the cockpits of domestic airliners on several occasions .
it has also aroused another fear in her coterie - the foreboding that they will never make it to a foreign country .
now a sadhu in bhopal , who does not wish to be identified , is trying to address the problem and help the minister rise above her phobia .
singh later donated all the silver ingots , worth rs 6.5 lakh , to charity but kept the sword .
guess that ' ll come in handy for the uttar pradesh polls .
it is clever semantics by the ophthalmologist - turned - politician .
for in the run up to america ' s big war against the taliban , afghanistan ' s ruling regime , the front is critical to the us plans .
it wants to be a key player in any future regime in afghanistan .
so abdullah wants to project to the world that its influence is not just restricted to certain pockets in northern afghanistan .
but khan is still the most experienced commander in masood ' s army and after his death it was decided he was the best choice .
his lack of political ambition also makes it easier for the front to integrate into any power structure that emerges after the war .
q . how do you view india ' s offer of help to the us after the terrorist attacks ?
q . pakistan is not willing to fully derecognise the taliban .
what do you think is its game plan ?
a . this shows that it still wants to retain influence on afghanistan .
the current situation was created by pakistan .
a . pakistan is not in a position to play the role of a frontline state as it did during the soviet invasion of afghanistan .
if it tries to plant another taliban - like leverage , it will regret once again .
q . what is your information on the us forces launching special operations ?
q . what will be the key to political stability in afghanistan ?
a . the primary challenge is restoration of regional and global security .
modi on his part was more restrained .
" keshubhai is still the driver of the bjp chariot , " he said .
obviously , this was the way out of the red .
these shifts in human attitudes are n ' t captured by military surveillance .
in pakistan ' s time - honoured tradition of power politics , king - makers seldom outlast the king .
within 90 days of appointing hassan as army chief , bhutto had him removed .
the reshuffles by themselves may not suffice .

it ' s a long way from kathputli colony to the royal mile in edinburgh .
for puppeteer bala bhatt it ' s the distance between two worlds .

bhatt ' s address : kathputli colony , near shadipur depot , new delhi , india .
over the past four decades , hundreds of street performers from across the country have made this place their home .
today , about 800 such families live here .
many have participated in festivals of india and other cultural roadshows abroad .
if it ' s ram karan bhopa you want , try his mobile .
this musician from rajasthan plays a folk instrument called the ravanhatha .
he has performed in the us , the uk , france and other countries .
here in india , he arranges shows for private gatherings .
the charges for a musical evening : rs 2,500 .
but work , he says , is sporadic and the money is never enough .
" friends from abroad are shocked when they visit us , " he adds .
" they tell us , ' we thought you ' d be rich .
does n ' t the government help you ? ' "
the animosity towards the authorities is long - standing .
" the world knows this address , " says magician aziz khan .
" besides , this is a central location .
if we were to shift to the places the government has in mind , most of our earnings would be spent on conveyance . "
press photographers are met with demands for " money before you shoot " .
journalists encounter scuffles among artistes , with each wanting to be interviewed .
it does n ' t help that some of those , who were allotted land by the government , sold those plots and returned to their jhuggis .
bhatt admits : " such people have spoilt our reputation .
when they are unmasked , it spoils things for those of us who are honest . "
but they are rarely alone in their struggle .

now that the court cases have been settled , the workers are going at it hammer and tongs , so to say .
as for resources , with help from devotees the temple is never short .
like one who came all the way from punjab , volunteering to fix new iron railings around the temple compound .
and since jagannath would make chatia his home sooner or later , work is also on to construct a huge kitchen to cater to divine palates .
once the railings are in place and the kitchen ready , the faithful may think of something more ingenious to build in future .
if they can ' t , they might well decide to pull down the kitchen and build it afresh .
that ' s good news for the masons in the immediate vicinity , to say the least .
woman grandmaster : how illustrious is that ?
the party always had its reserves of musclemen and dons but none of the mobocrats would share a public podium with leaders like basu .
with the ascendancy of ghosh , the cpi ( m ) seems set for a cultural revolution of its own kind .
that means an inevitable invitation to political violence , but nobody has the power or the will to pre - empt it .
mamata is certain that the secret to the cpi ( m ) ' s success in the past elections lies in its misuse of governmental power .
ananth kumar was also held responsible for the suspension of former bjp state president b . b . shivappa ( 1983 - 1987 ) .
shivappa was a frontrunner in the election to the post of the opposition leader in the assembly last october but was outwitted by shettar .
bjp spokesman m . venkaiah naidu had promised an inquiry but none has been conducted till date .
" ideally it should have been referred to the disciplinary committee within three months , " says shivappa .
" look at the condition of the party , " complains tunga .
" it is under the total control of the ananth kumar - yediyurappa - naidu troika . "
i am not aware who they were trying to kill .
there has been no attempt on my life and i do n ' t know any of the shooters . "
what exactly was the provocation for the botched - up attack , besides previous enmity ?
the thai police believe large stakes in a major arms smuggling and supply racket could be the cause .
the shoot - out , it seems , followed a negotiated settlement which failed .
it now transpires that dawood ibrahim ' s aide chhota shakeel had been visiting bangkok regularly for three months .
shakeel , however , denies having met rajan ( see interview ) .
the criminals left behind lots of evidence .
it is more than just a shoot - out and it has been handed over to our foreign affairs department special branch . "
meanwhile rajan is likely to be charged for alleged mis - declarations while entering thailand .
he arrived in january on a tourist visa valid for three months .
in april he applied for a change in his visa status from tourist to business and sought a licence to start a company called kadam export import .
rajan may also be questioned on the piloo khan murder case .
khan , a drug peddler who played a role in the mumbai blasts of 1993 , was killed in bangkok in 1994 .
this might be the first step towards his extradition to india .
again , that could be part of rajan ' s design .
in court , rajan apparently told waiting mediapersons , " i want to go back to india to surrender . "
this vindicates the pride the chinese feel , at any rate should feel , for this $ 150 million marvel .
it was a playground for the great game .
today , the new great game is afoot .
of the three old contestants , the latecomer , china , seems set to walk away with the prize .
it ' s not just a diplomatic triumph it could score though .
in xinjiang , china hopes to defeat its own in - house insurgency , the uyghur muslim " splittists " , with the market and free trade .
the highways of urumchi and turfan will be its new silk route .
it shares borders with mongolia , russia , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , afghanistan , india , pakistan - occupied kashmir and tibet .
as vice - foreign minister wang yi admits , " we are in contact with many factions in afghanistan , including the taliban . "
the final weapon was trade .
china offered its neighbours a deal : our consumer goods for your energy resources .
ancient border posts were reopened .
today , of xinjiang ' s $ 1.3 billion exports , half are to neighbouring countries .
a 4,167 km gas pipeline will take kazakh gas to shanghai , on china ' s eastern edge .
the 48 - hour almaty - urumqi train runs two times a week , ferrying oil .
soon a rail network will connect shanghai to amsterdam .
by giving them a stake in stability , china holds its neighbours are unlikely to ever back uyghur terrorism .
the province ' s energy reserves - 30 billion tonnes of oil and 10.3 trillion cubic metres of gas - are being thrown open to mncs .
jokes a local : " almost every american i meet in urumqi is a geologist . "
trade as foreign policy with the exception of russia , everybody in the shanghai five is into the new silk route .
agrees an academic in beijing : " trade is now one of the main components of china ' s foreign policy .
leave the border disputes to the next generation . "
that really is the lesson for india , whose bilateral trade with china is valued at an abysmal $ 2 billion .

the negotiations between the tamil nadu government and veerappan are a strange intercourse .

sudarshan and parekh represent two extreme responses to the growing menace of multiculturalism .
consequently , until the cultural ethos surrounding nationhood is redefined , the minorities remain alienated from the nation and the flag .
to effect this redefinition , there must be affirmative action , a reassessment of history and a state - sponsored cultural engineering .

however , the current state of bic is bad enough to disrupt their eternal peace .
its two woollen mills in kanpur and punjab , known for the lal imli and dhariwal brands , now work at 15 per cent of their capacity .
this does not include an annual interest bill of rs 21.59 crore on loans taken from the state bank of india ( sbi ) .
the company is without any working capital since .
that ' s the typical defensive endgame of managers of failed psus .
bic has lost dominance in every field where it had a reasonable presence - blankets , lohi ( shawls ) and government supply of regulation woollen uniforms .
if bic still has a toehold in the government supply market , it is because of a controversial price preference given by the union government to all central psus .
bic ' s spinning and weaving mills are fairly modern , having been imported in the first flush of the 1981 nationalisation .
but machines alone do not a successful business make .
" i am happy , " she whispered to anyone who cared to listen .
among the guests at the rustic banquet on october 21 was phanas punji , banita ' s sister - in - law .
phanas and banita had become icons that seared consciences and rajiv was prompt to promise help to both the women ( india today , july 31 , 1985 ) .
political promises , such as they are , almost never materialise .
politics plays strange tricks .
last month , das was on a march through bolangir district - where banita now lives with bidyadhar - when he heard about her .
" though i cannot make her rich , the least i could have done was to restore banita ' s dignity , " says das .
and he did .
critics say that das is resorting to gimmicks to corner publicity .

" banita will stay poor as ever . "

his evolutionary tale ran parallel to the life and times of his party , the most defining political force of 20th century india .
something that can be said about kesri too .
there was even a kind of celebration at the lowest level - the grassroots partymen : one of us could make it .
not charismatic , non - elitist , and still kesri became the elected boss .
the keeper of over rs 10,000 crore deserved it .
thankfully , the dynasty was in a to - be - or - not - to - be mood .
still , the nation will not remember kesri for his symbolism .
he has immortalised himself by parading his ambition , rather , his dream .
india missed a prime minister , and , for a while , had instability , and finally , yet another mid - term election .
there was a spartan charm about the last congressman in a gandhi topi .
for instance , he preferred gaddi - bolsters - spitoon to chair - and - table in his office .
a notable contribution of his party presidency was the return of the prodigal - madhavrao scindia , arjun singh and n . d . tiwari .
he was the one who brought manmohan singh , the liberalisation pioneer , to the congress working committee .
simultaneously - and paradoxically - he projected himself as the second mandal messiah .
yet another feature of the package relates the incentive to the turnover of spares produced in the factory .
underlying the incentive war is an effort of the mul management to make the workers accept the japanese production philosophy of kaizen , or constant improvement of existing ability .
inspired by it , mul is raising labour productivity in novel ways .
that saves power , time , labour and cost .
kaizen is anything but an airy - fairy management jargon .
it has helped the company instal its third plant of one - lakh - car capacity last year without hiring a single extra hand .
the answers are n ' t flattering and point to a larger malaise at the very top .
even when the decision was taken in october 1999 to remove kalyan singh , the leadership was quite clear in its mind that rajnath was the natural successor .
however , with kalyan ' s expulsion from the bjp , the gupta option was blessed with instant obsolescence .
was it fair of the leadership to burden rajnath with so horrific an inheritance and so daunting a challenge ?
these awkward questions have to be bluntly put to the prime minister , whose remote control of uttar pradesh affairs has placed the bjp in this unenviable position .
the problem stems from vajpayee ' s inexplicable dependence on state urban development minister lalji tandon .
a long - time associate of vajpayee and , in effect , his constituency minder , tandon ' s role in lucknow has been plain disruptionist .
last year , as election manager , tandon mounted such an ostentatious campaign in lucknow that vajpayee ' s image was sullied and his majority reduced .
flattery and cronyism are occupational hazards of any prime minister and vajpayee is n ' t an exception .
thanks to a spell of ill health and immobility , he has been cocooned in an atmosphere of intrigues and make - believe conspiracies .
the mess in uttar pradesh should warn him against allowing vanity to get the better of his political judgment .
he is too tall a leader to let insecurity and vengeful conduct to sully his record .
it ' s a very familiar murmuring of discontent , heard only in the corridors of bureaucratic power .
one official ' s promotion is invariably seen as another ' s denied due .
perhaps it ' s time the complaint was dissected in public , time to ask questions .
should seniority alone be the criterion in promotion ?
should the bureaucracy be independent of the competitive spirit ?
why ca n ' t the finest be the boss ?
the questions are relevant in this area because they have already become redundant in other areas of management .
it ' s the age of the fittest , not the eldest .
there ' s no harm in indian bureaucracy modernising itself - from within .
unfortunately , the indian reality is : once you have passed the indian administrative or foreign service , the rest is service without competition .
nothing counts except the age of experience .
there is no internal mechanism to put the most competent on the fast track .
many smart officers do n ' t reach the top because they happen to be junior to officers who need not be competent .
maybe , the government should emulate the private sector in this regard .
privatisation is worth trying out within the government services too , at least in the promotion of officers .
in many developed countries there is an internal system that ensures the brightest is not left behind - in britain , for instance .
india has a bloated bureaucracy , and a major part of it is eminently disposable .
for the moment , see that the best is not allowed to rot .
share the blues even a depressed market holds cheery prospects for the long term
blue has been turning red on the indian stock markets this past fortnight .
the share prices of a slew of india ' s bluest chip companies have fallen to their lowest levels in the almost half a decade .
the plunge is across the board .
a share of tata tea is available for rs 180 or so ; only this february the price was rs 510 .
the only exception are software shares , though even their growth trajectory has flattened .
three factors explain this unprecedented pounding of the high and mighty on dalal street .
the stock market as a whole has been depressed and volatile .
the economy itself seems to be falling into a slumber .
sales and production figures are sluggish and agriculture production may actually be lower than the previous year .
then there is the global contagion .
every major stock market index across the globe - from the nasdaq in new york to the nikkei in tokyo - is in a tumble .
the question really is : what do small investors do ?
should they be tempted into buying some of the best - known stocks now virtually being sold for a song ?
analysts believe the market has hit the bottom , even though , perhaps paradoxically , no one foresees an upturn soon .
that will be as much a vote for the future of efficient and competitive indian companies as for the economy as a whole .
it ' s also one way to turn the red into pink on the markets .
viewpoint : teresita c . schaffer
different strokes the republicans and democrats differ more in how they talk about foreign and strategic policy than in how they carry it out .
this will also be true under a gore or a bush administration .
but their actions are unlikely to differ very much .
the campaign suggests two areas of contrast .
on international nuclear issues , bush has expressed strong opposition to the ctbt .
he would drop or de - emphasise the ctbt issue in his dialogue with india .
the other contrast is on china , where bush has staked out a much tougher position than gore .
we are already on the threshold of a mature , long - term relationship .
we have narrowed down our differences considerably .
so there will be no tectonic shifts .
if bush comes in , things may be marginally easier on the nuclear issue .
if gore wins , with the congress being dominated by the republicans , he will not be able to push through the ctbt .
so we are likely to see a status quo on the nuclear front .
india ' s role in south asia is on a sound footing and we have moved from the cold war periphery to the centre of us foreign policy .
we are no more being equated with pakistan .
but the differences in approach will probably be in the nuances and the emphasis .
there is now a window of opportunity created to make up for the years of inertia .
if bush takes a presidential initiative and lifts the economic sanctions it would make a substantial difference .
their votes are expected to come in latest by november 17 .
even then , america seems headed for its worst constitutional crisis that could see results postponed till early january .
as outgoing president bill clinton wryly observed , " the american people have spoken .
but we may have to wait awhile to determine what they said . "
much of the chaos is because of the existing electoral system .
a state ' s number of electors equals the number it sends to the senate and the house of representatives .
florida , for instance , contributes 25 electors .
to be voted president , a candidate needs to win more than 270 of the total 538 electors in the college .
by the end of the bizarre week , even the world seemed to be on hold .
senior indian policymakers flew into washington dc during election week to touch base mainly with bush ' s republican team on a range of issues .
but they had to wait till the outcome of the results .
if the democrats come back , india can expect gore to continue clinton ' s policy of building a long - term relationship .
india is rattled though about gore making the ratification of the ctbt and non - proliferation a priority issue .
but he may be stymied in his efforts to get the us congress to ratify the ctbt with republicans gaining a slender majority in both the houses .
india may be happier if the initial count is proved right and bush emerges the winner .
but since then he has made amends .
he is likely to appoint the gulf war hero colin powell as his secretary of state and his foreign policy tutor condoleeza rice as national security adviser .
and not because it belongs to sher shah suri , the daring afghan ruler who almost yanked the mighty mughals from the centrestage of history .

the state has also decided to stop all computerised draws forthwith .
interestingly , both the hardware and software for the first ever computerised draw was provided to the two governments by martin .
normally , there is little chance of the numbers being identical .
according to software makers grambls consultancy , " the numbers are generated using a " random " function .
we have no control over it . "
the number of winners has also come down , especially in the southern states , where lotteries now have the biggest markets .
" i wo n ' t be surprised , given martin ' s track record , if most draws are fixed , " charges khurana .
there are other facets to the intriguing martin saga .
subba has been under a cloud for long .
but certainly we have to think of the industry , since so many depend on it . "

so our fate is linked to public spending there . "

this is especially important now that the cbi has become adept at using the media as a lynch mob .
look only at the manner in which its report on match - fixing was leaked to the press .
it is possible the cricketers the cbi report points its finger at are guilty but surely this should be proved in a court of law .
at the same time it leaks its report to newspapers and television channels so that our former cricketing heroes are tried and condemned in the media .
the fact that it remains pretty much unchanged since the british raj created it speaks for itself .

bang out of nowhere , india had a full - fledged political controversy on its hands .
reviving the great ayodhya debate is certainly not top priority for the common indian .
ayodhya has become the political equivalent of theatre .
beyond the competitive emotionalism , it has to be recognised that it is , in essence , a legal issue .
the land dispute is pending before the allahabad high court , the agency that will hopefully settle matters .
slow as progress may be , a special sessions court is trying this case .
give it time and it will do justice to ayodhya as well .
till then keep ram and babar out of politics .
unfortunately , in faraway towns and villages and even among the less privileged in the metros , the post office retains its importance .
the government is unwilling because it has no money and delivering letters is anyway a loss - making venture .
true , there is an inherent subsidy to any plain postal system but bottom lines can he helped by an innovative mix of franchising and value addition .
by allowing private shops , even the ubiquitous corner paanwallah , to hawk them , the government will save itself much money .
that apart , postal infrastructure can be put to better use .
what stops it from upgrading its facilities and competing with the local branch of the state bank ?
further , as part of the planned internet revolution , the government hopes to set up a string of cyberkiosks across the indian landscape .
instead of building afresh , why not just use the post office ?

the civil service , of course , blossomed when the east india company moved from the arena of commerce to governance .
today , that no longer holds .

the business of governance is still carried out by the patwari , the thanedar , the tehsildar and the state civil services .
and not by the all - india services who are a burdensome problem and have become a cadre for themselves , by themselves and of themselves .
it is high time we wound up the all - india services .

but if there is one thing that gets his goat it is being called a mukhauta ( mask ) .
when , in 1998 , a gossip column attributed such a remark to the former bjp general secretary k . n . govindacharya , vajpayee blew a fuse .
he demanded action against govindacharya and it required the intervention of the big guns of the rss to cool him down .
at that time vajpayee was not prime minister and did n ' t enjoy the pre - eminence he does now .
so it was two years before govindacharya was removed from the bjp leadership and banished on study leave .
last month it happened again .
he led the bjp campaigns in 1996 and 1998 when the building of a ram temple figured in the manifesto .
equally strange is that vajpayee opted for the written word over his natural preference for sound bites .
the suggestion that the prime minister was anticipating the dharma sansad ' s ultimatum to the government does n ' t wash .
the government must be aware that the vhp is unlikely to press for temple construction on the disputed site at this juncture .
it will probably demand the construction of some gates in an undisputed corner of ayodhya .
this may well be the proverbial thin end of the wedge but the issue wo n ' t be provocative enough to trigger a political fallout .
at best , vajpayee could have told the vhp where to get off without undertaking a convoluted exercise in revisionism .

third , regions like the eastern states and maharashtra - at least officially - are power surplus .

if there was an irony lurking somewhere , it must have been lost on the sombre listeners .
by its every nature history is interpretative and subjective .
a contest of ideas and a certain debate and engagement can only enrich the subject .
these profundities are of course beyond controversy .

the opinion poll suggests that there is a very wide measure of acceptance of the prime minister ' s recent initiatives .
the cease - fire in kashmir is endorsed and there is an acceptance of the need to talk with pakistan .
only in gujarat , where the support for the bjp seems quite resounding , is there a measure of scepticism .
this may be an indication that when it comes to nationalism , vajpayee ' s main problem is likely to come from within his own parivar .
the prime minister ' s reluctance to carry the " national sentiment " of the past on ayodhya into the present tense may well test corporate loyalties .
that ' s real progress .
but he knew that for long years it would remain one of indian aviation history ' s most significant moments .
the lca would be only the second combat aircraft to be indigenously built and flown .
in an unprecedented exercise , they had pooled their resources for the past decade to overcome years of sloth in the country ' s aeronautical development .
the project , in the making since 1983 , had been bedevilled by slippages and cost - overruns .
the aircraft were to replace the aging mig 21 squadrons as the workhorse of the indian air force ( iaf ) .
but the delays raised serious doubts on whether by the time the lca became fully operational the iaf would find use for them .

the problems do n ' t stop there .
idpl staff is not only surplus but possesses little or no relevant skill .
out of 7,178 employees , only 880 are executives , the rest being either workers or supervisors promoted from the ranks .
almost 80 per cent of the employees are above 48 , recruitment having been stopped many years ago .
many employees are engaged in other jobs and come to the factory for an hour or so only to mark attendance .
a solution perhaps lies in giving the employees a share in the sale proceeds of the company ' s land and buildings .

while general classifications exist , there is no particular mention of such a variety of mango tree .
the tree , however , does find mention in studies by navigator ashok marathe as also in a book on parsi culture by historian rustom barjorji paymaster .
according to paymaster , the tree had a radius of 35 ft and around 10 branches in 1916 when the book was written .
such records notwithstanding , the parsis say that the knowledge about the tree has been handed down to them orally over generations .
the mango tree is so much a part of parsi history that its survival , in many ways , is associated with that of the community itself .
right now , the mango tree , with its 25 - ft radius , stands on land belonging to ahmedbhai , a muslim farmer .
one of its branches , however , is trying to take root in a neighbouring farm which belongs to vallibhai , a paddy farmer .
if the tree " walks " in , vallibhai ' s paddy crop will be lost .
a small farmer who fears a threat to his livelihood , he is making no bones of not wanting the tree to take root .
in fact , he has been severing the extended branch every now and then .
concerned members of the community have appealed to the gujarat government to get the tree declared a heritage site and acquire the land around it .
the government maintains that there is no provision under the existing framework to afford protection to a tree .
but as one parsi argues , the mango tree is an unprecedented case that merits unique treatment .
it is a tree that was meant to be timeless .
by labonita ghosh when the police found him , khokon modok ' s bloodied body was lying by the highway .
remnants of a bomb and a crude pipe - gun were found near him .
a month later , an investigation into modok ' s death revealed that the part - time weaver was not even on the spot .
that , in fact , there had not been a shootout at all .
modok had been whisked away from home in a police jeep and shot at point - blank range .
the next day , his body washed up on the banks of the teesta river , 10 km away from the site .

does the west bengal police really need another excuse to be trigger happy ?
that ' s what people are asking chief minister buddhadev bhattacharya .
then he added a controversial rider : " shoot if you need to and do n ' t worry about human rights .
i ' ll take care of that . "
bhattacharya ' s message was a clear order to the force to get tough with criminals .
calcuttans were outraged .
not everyone , though .
residents of bhattacharya ' s jadavpur constituency welcomed the order .
in november , the kasba - jadavpur area witnessed back - to - back robberies , a grisly murder and a rash of minor incidents .
with crime in a tailspin , bhattacharya ' s announcement is seen as a much - needed shot in the arm for the police force .
indeed , over - vigilance - sometimes to the point of being meddlesome - has been seen as a bad thing .
a few months ago , a well - known miscreant tried to slash his wrists and frame the officer - in - charge in a torture case .
the result : the police is reined in , while crime spirals out of hand .
unfortunately , an unflattering track record makes it difficult for people to side with the police .
" and who decides which person is a criminal ? "
minister of state for sports shahnawaz hussain thundered that he was answerable to parliament .
the board reminded him that hussain did in fact send questions across to secretary j . y . lele ' s office which then formulated replies made to parliament .
india ' s next coach , he says , should come from overseas in keeping with world wide trends .
the end game to cricket ' s crisis has begun with preservation of status quo within the board and identification of the fall guys outside it .
vision 2000 is about vision of a very different kind , the kind called myopia .
" we do n ' t know why he said it , " says chairman justice mukul gopal mukherji .
" it could be to activate the police force rather than incite violence .
we ' ve sought a clarification . "
and second , the police are n ' t the crack team everyone would like them to be .
a part of the reason lies in the police ' s less - than - satisfactory training conditions .
in reality , they rarely get time .
officers who run the academy have petitioned the government for improvements .
regardless of skill , it ' s the split - second decision to use the gun in a tight situation that makes all the difference .
police trainers hope that will come with the 20 - odd sensitisation classes organised ever year .
ironically , about eight of these are conducted by the wbhrc itself .
" it takes these morale - boosters to galvanise them into action . "
and not just some hardline dictates from the top .
the election clause was a legacy of jawaharlal nehru and there was no way it could be waived in such a cavalier manner , he pointed out .
as yadav played out the dynasty number , sonia ' s managers frowned .
who was this new malcontent ?
but yadav was not a dissident cast in the mould of either the late rajesh pilot or the now subordinated jitendra prasada .
he was the convener of the constitution review committee that had recommended it .
yadav ' s reminiscence about nehru ' s democratic credentials irked sonia ' s managers .
what if she developed an emotional value for the election clause in the manner of her mother - in - law indira ?
in 1972 , indira disregarded advice to avoid elections .
the result : a young turk named chandra shekhar was elected to the cwc much against her wishes .
it would take two months to convene an aicc plenary session , a sonia aide is quick to point out .
in party circles yadav ' s defiance has sharpened the election versus selection debate .
selection is a conspiracy against change , they say .
an election , they argue , would have brought to fore moneybags .
they found comparisons with indira ' s conduct in1972 odious .
" can any of the aspirants match chandra shekhar ' s stature ? " one of them asks .
they underscore the futility of elections by citing the example of 1992 when all those who got elected had to resign .
they do not see the selection process imposing any awesome responsibility on sonia .
afghanistan and pakistan constitute one contiguous and coordinated criminal enterprise based on drugs , smuggling and fanaticism .
together , the taliban and isi give depth and resilience to the jehad being waged against india , iran , the central asian republics and the west .
having nurtured a monster , pakistan is no longer in a position to discard or control its monstrous creation .
the talibanisation of pakistan ' s elaborate network of madarsas is complete .
kashmir , kosovo , chechnya and the war against the northern opposition in afghanistan fit the bill easily .
much more fundamental is a genetic problem that has impaired the political functioning of the inheritors of the late ram manohar lohia ' s mantle .
in plain language , it has meant the utter inability of the socialists - now attached to various splinter groups - to operate as a cohesive group .
no wonder the socialists are considered temperamentally disruptionist and a potential threat to any coalition government .
certainly , this has been the record of the movement since 1977 .
laloo prasad yadav in bihar and naveen patnaik in orissa have escaped political devastation by forming regional parties with no apparent links to the socialist ideologues .
regardless of his colourful past , his conduct in the a . b . vajpayee government has been exemplary .
far from being a coalition wrecker , he has become the focal point of the non - bjp parties in the nda .
there are conflicting reports on this .
projections by pune - based ngo prayas show that there will be a power surplus of 9.5 per cent by the year 2004 - 05 in maharashtra .
what ' s not clear though is on what assumptions of demand increase are these projections based on .
why ca n ' t excess power be sold to other states ?
q . what ' s the solution ?
a . today a minister draws a bigger crowd than a party leader .
i will make every effort to enforce discipline and free the cadre from power - oriented politics .
q . how do you see the role of the party chief vis - a - vis the government ?
a . proper co - ordination and communication will remove confusion .
i will try to strength coordination which was established by kushabhau thakreji .
q . do you foresee any conflict between the sangh parivar and the bjp or the government on certain issues ?
a . disagreement does not mean confrontation .
the rss and the swadeshi jagran manch have different perception and the bjp , as head of the nda government , has certain compulsions .
the economic reform was only in its infancy then .
the table has turned since .
it is rapidly advancing into an information technology revolution and into the knowledge economy . "
for india , it was the single largest foreign investment .
it was the best red salute that vajpayee could have hoped to earn .
when krishna deva raya landed in halim perdana kusuma airport in jakarta , a still bigger surprise was awaiting vajpayee .
breaking protocol , president abdurrahman wahid of indonesia was waiting at the foot of the aircraft steps to receive him .
on kashmir , its policy is that the issue should be resolved through dialogue within the framework of the simla agreement and the un resolution .
in jakarta , as in hanoi , the warmth of reception rose by many degrees because of india ' s giant strides in the knowledge industry .
why are they turning to india for a boost on the it front ?
india ' s attraction lies in its ability to develop customised software for western ( particularly us ) businesses .
india has a headstart in this exciting future economy because of its abundant resource of people who can write software and know english .
it is a gift from lord macaulay which east asia lacks .
it reassured the hosts that india ' s foreign policy does not waffle .
the realisation of strength has worked on vajpayee like power tonic .
indians are more familiar with li as the former prime minister of china .
for it was during his two contiguous tenures in that powerful post that india ' s relations with china made rapid strides forward after years of misgivings .
in many ways he was the architect of the great leap forward in sino - indian relations .
china launched a volley of harsh words against india in the un and other fora .
li ' s visit is china acknowledging that relations are almost back to pre - pokhran days .
apart from the prime minister , he is meeting a large number of key indian politicians , senior officials and leading businessmen .
despite being accompanied by a 120 - member delegation , interactions with business people do not form a major part of his itinerary .
in delhi he was feted by indian parliamentarians and was slotted to meet prime minister a . b . vajpayee after his return from indonesia .
after the mandatory visit to agra , li will fly to bangalore to see the infosys campus .
li maintained an inscrutable silence over the affair .
most of all for the goodwill that li brings with him .
only last month the voltage frequency shot up to the levels where the tripping of enron ' s phase ii power plant seemed a possibility .
of course , controversy is not new to the twice - born dabhol power corporation - the us multinational ' s indian subsidiary .
the latest one stems from a sudden rise in the cost of dpc ' s power .
not surprisingly , that made mseb broke which defaulted on its payments to dpc .
when the cost shot up to over rs 7 a unit in july 2000 , the mseb was purchasing only 30 per cent of dpc ' s power .
" so we chose to keep enron waiting . ' '
who ' s at fault : mseb or enron ?
the genesis of the problem lies in the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) or the contract signed between mseb and the dpc in december 1993 .
the board had agreed to purchase 90 per cent of generated power .
as it turns out , power scarcity was probably exaggerated .
the ppa also stipulates that enron ' s power would be indexed to the dollar and oil prices .
fluctuations in these variables automatically resulted in an increase in the price of electricity .
since bangaru laxman was chosen the bjp chief last august , he has been faithfully parroting prime minister atal bihari vajpayee .
so faithfully that there is a growing impression both within and outside the party that the bjp and vajpayee are synonymous .
besides , it also set up a panel headed by former rajasthan chief minister bhairon singh shekhawat to study the subject .
from the party calling the shots , it ' s the government that is now setting the bjp agenda .
we will crush it before it raises its head . "
" i am confident our partners will carry on the good work , conforming to the coalition dharma , " he told the national executive .
quite a change for an organisation that once claimed that a personality cult was the prerogative of the congress .
the story is probably apocryphal .
this is not to suggest that the last two years of bill clinton ' s administration were inimical to india .
of course , that ' s not the whole explanation for the indo - us honeymoon after the tremors of pokhran .
but history is n ' t always dictated by impersonal forces , as marxists like to believe .
the personal preferences of leaders do have a way of shaping events , even things as abstruse and grandiose as foreign policy .
but that should n ' t worry decision - makers in the south block .
it will not be unduly swayed by the green eco - fundamentalism that has gripped multilateral agencies like the world bank .
it is expected to engage china in a way that is ultimately beneficial to india .
finally , it is certain to be more uncompromising in countering the terrorist jehad that threatens civil society throughout asia .
of course , these are early days , with many imponderables like the developments in capitol hill .
but what sets conservative governments apart from their liberal or socialist counterparts is a disinclination to be infuriatingly preachy .
conservatives may be less agreeable socially but they know the world much better .
few commentators had the courage to admit that it would make no difference at all , that it did not matter who went or why .
so , sitting in distant islamabad , pakistan ' s unelected government has decided who should represent the kashmiri people .
a little like jarnail singh bhindranwale deciding , in those long gone days , that he represented the sikh community .
something like this is happening to farooq abdullah .
as jammu and kashmir ' s legally elected chief minister you would think that he had some right to speak for the state .
tch , tch , very bad , very bad .
in short , we are yet again allowing terrorism to triumph over democracy .
if we did we could dictate the agenda and pakistan would have to listen .
there can be no peace process in kashmir until the government of india decides what it wants to achieve and how .
meanwhile , it would help our position considerably if we were seen to be improving our human rights record in the valley .
this is only the domestic dimension .
fine , but what are we going to do about it ?
are we going to talk to pakistan directly ?
are we going to seek international mediation ?
and , if we are going to do neither , what do we plan to do ?
at one time , senior officials in delhi said they were not talking to pakistan because they wanted the general to stew in his own mess .
then why are we allowing the hurriyat delegation to go at all ?
it is an absurd situation in which the hurriyat delegation is yet another absurdity .
even if the hurriyat leaders succeed in going , what do they hope to achieve ?
since they consider themselves kashmiri and not indian we cannot demand answers from them .
but we certainly have a right to demand answers - if not a clear kashmir policy - from our own government .
can we have some answers please ?
it supplies power at a dollar - denominated rate , which obviously rises as the rupee falls .
it is easy to be swayed by figures , particularly allegations like " at rs 7 per unit , this is the world ' s most expensive electricity " .
the fact is , turfing out enron will do india great harm .
for one , the company was one of the biggest contributors to george bush ' s presidential campaign and has enormous influence on the white house .
second , of the $ 3 - billion capital investment in the dpc project , $ 1.2 billion has been borrowed from indian institutions .
a larger issue is at stake as well .
a contract has , or should have , a certain sanctity here .
to some degree india ' s half - baked reforms are responsible for the mess .
dpc uses naphtha as fuel for its phase i plant .
this leaves it hostage to volatile oil prices .
since india restricts futures trading in petroleum , dabhol is not at liberty to hedge .
next , mseb buys no more than 60 per cent of dabhol ' s power .
economy of scale implies the more power the plant produces , the cheaper each unit will become .
the ppa can be reconfigured to allow dpc to sell to other agencies as well .
the solution lies in making the best of an imperfect deal , not in grandstanding .
chief minister buddhadev bhattacharya is by all accounts a decent man but in no apparent control of communist cadre gone berserk .
somewhere between extreme indifference and extreme reaction lies the truth - and the hapless , beleaguered citizen of bengal .
cretinous and criminalised trade unionism is another headache .
the incineration of two jute mill executives just outside kolkata on january 13 was bengal ' s very own version of the graham staines killing .
in the bjp decisions are not taken by any individual . it ' s always a collective effort .
lashkar - e - toiba , harkat - ul - mujahideen , al faran , jaish - e - mohammed .
to those unfamiliar with the situation in kashmir it might seem as if we were fighting all of allah ' s armies .
for two decade cpi ( m ) - inspired violence , at any rate intimidation , has gone hand in hand with " scientific rigging " .
this summer the left front faces its strongest challenge ever , making an uncorrupted election all the more vital .
president ' s rule , whatever mamata may say , is not the answer .
rather , the election commission ( ec ) needs to display the evangelical zeal it reserved for bihar in 1995 .
laloo yadav still won - but only in a fair contest .
once the stay is removed , the centre plans to hasten the winding up of bgml .
the workers mark attendance , and spend a few hours hanging out at the idle plants and the rusted cages .
the famed township of gold wears an eerie look now .
the mining activities at the deeper levels in kolar goldmines became uneconomic as early as the 1980s due to depletion in the high grade ore reserves .
the interest charged to its profit and loss account in 1998 - 99 equals the operating income for that year .
the company was referred to the board of industrial and financial reconstruction ( bifr ) in early 1992 and was declared sick on august 28 , 1992 .
in july 1993 the bifr was appointed as the operating agency to prepare a scheme for revival / rehabilitation of the company .
the agency had submitted proposals in march 1994 , october 1996 and july 1997 .
the july 1997 proposal envisaged a fresh infusion of about rs 200 crore which the centre rejected .
divided among as many as 18 unions , the workers were obviously ill - advised by their leaders in spurning vss offers .
earlier the workers hoped for wage revisions , which would have augmented the vss packet .
however , the workers with an average age of 45 do not have much hope of finding a job .
for example , the huge rs 70 - crore bill the state electricity board has slapped on bgml has to be sorted out .
even in the past , the domestic goldmines in india never had the potential for market intervention .
progress here has actually meant the arrival of western detritus .
he claims to possess the largest private collection of coins in the north - east with around 4,000 gold , silver and bell - metal coins .
he is also the first to collect facsimiles of ancient manipuri stone inscriptions despite shoe - string finances .
within five years he produced a five - volume treatise , tales about the art and culture of manipura much sought - after book .
for in these five years , bahadur also began collecting cultural icons .
bahadurs exotic collection was initially housed in his residence till he established a museum in 1978 on the first floor of a rented building at imphal .
urged by kapila vatsyayan , the then union additional education secretary who had come to see his collection , he christened it mutua museum .
since its inception , around 20 illustrative books , 20 other projects , several educational charts and slides and video documentation have been undertaken by the mutua museum .
it has taken part in the restoration of defaced monuments and court mural paintings of manipur .
besides , a living museum was established at purul village in senapati district to preserve the traditionally carved houses of the tribals .
trips to the back of beyond have fossilised the antiquarians personal life .
he found out why : his house was flooded .
once a tribal chief threatened to kill him for wanting to know the meaning of a tribal work of art .
born in a poor family , bahadur started by making and selling recycled - paper toys .
his father , a burmese army soldier who loved travelling , inculcated the spirit of adventure in his son .
though bahadur never completed his graduation , he is now an examiner for awarding phds in manipuri culture at manipur university .
recognition has also come in the form of the special designer award in 1972 and the state kala academy award in folk arts in 1974 .
bahadur plans to set up a composite complex of the culture of south - east asia at andro .
truth , enthusiasm and discipline are the driving forces that motivate bahadur .
in a world of neglect and uncertainty its nice to believe someones still in charge of the past .
prasada , 62 , was the older of the duo .
he contested the party election for presidentship against sonia in november last but was miserably outmanoeuvred and outnumbered by the ruling coterie .
of the 7,542 valid votes , he polled a pitiful 94 .
the match was fixed behind my back , but i do n ' t claim that i would have won if she ' d played it straight . "
yet another young talent given a congress ticket by bahuguna that year was vishwanath pratap singh .
after finding his feet in the congress , prasada remained an organisation man till his last .
but i shall not leave the congress as long as i am in politics . "
he made prasada an aicc general secretary in 1985 and , later , his political secretary in the party .
in 1991 , when p . v . narasimha rao became prime minister and took charge of the party , he retained prasada as his political secretary .
when rao ' s court was filled with the likes of chandraswamy , the tantrik , it got prasada fuming .
yet he would not be disloyal to the party .
but he was too decent a dissident to wear it on his sleeves .
cost overruns .
poor quality .
infrastructure projects in india usually suffer from one or all of these predicaments .
but january 24 witnessed the unveiling of a project that steered clear of the usual hurdles .
it is the first infrastructure project to have been part - funded by money raised from the capital market .
" the flyway should set a benchmark for public - sector projects , " says pronab sen , adviser in the planning commission .
that means better driving , lower fuel consumption and lesser pollution .
the price for all these are toll charges which range from rs 7 for two - wheelers to rs 35 for buses and trucks .
but successful completion is only half the battle won .
the company , which is an offshoot of the infrastructure leasing and finance services , must now ensure that the flyway becomes a viable commercial venture .
that will depend on how much traffic it can attract .
the project has a total investment of rs 408 crore ( including land acquisition cost , construction cost , interest on debt , inflation and contingency ) .
the flyway is betting on attracting a large section of the seven lakh vehicles that travel between delhi and noida every day .
if it works as efficiently as it promises to , the flyway could also attract a rising proportion of the thriving population east of delhi .
noida ' s current population is five lakh which is expected to swell to 20 lakh in 15 years .
obviously the company has a challenging marketing job at hand .
" the company is actually aggressively marketing like any other service , " says cherian thomas , vice - president , operations , infrastructure development finance corporation .
another challenge is the political pressure being exerted for waiving the user charges .
but deft handling can prevent such populist gimmicks .
maybe what the dnd flyway needs is more vvips to drive through .
that is a holy dip - more precisely ardha snan or half dip - in the ganga during the mahakumbha in allahabad .
a day earlier , the party had announced she would do aachman - ritually rinsing her mouth - to symbolically associate herself with the mega hindu event .
its italian - born roman catholic leader had shed her european inhibitions .
start a peace process not because we think it will work but because it will look good .
refuse foreign mediation because we want to continue pretending there are no international dimensions to the kashmir problem .
insist on bilateral discussions because even if the simla agreement failed it was our idea and we should stick to it .
the end result of the current peace process , as any perceptive observer should see , is likely to be zero .
there are other puzzling things about the prime minister ' s kashmir policy .
when farooq abdullah passed his autonomy bill there was general hysteria in delhi .
farooq became , instantly , in everyone ' s eyes a traitor , an enemy of india and someone not worth speaking to anymore .
he was only asking for autonomy within the union of india , not secession .
there is something surreal about this .
to be sure , the scale of the state government ' s rebuilding project was staggering .
nearly rs 800 crore from a world bank loan was spent constructing over 30,000 new houses .
around 8,400 houses were built by donor agencies .
some 1.97 lakh houses in the two districts were retrofitted with quake - resistant material and destroyed villages were relocated and rebuilt .
" we had severe water shortage in may 1998 .
but the rest of the houses have been certified by seismic experts from iit mumbai . "
being the focus of millions of dollars worth of aid and free foodgrains , the people simply stopped working .
state officials say relief should not last for more than a month .
but it ' s the extent of psychological trauma that ' s difficult to gauge .
then , of course , there is the omnipresent existentialist dilemma that hampered people from getting back to routine life .
it ' s a chilling reminder of how an earthquake ' s destructive power can be magnified by official ineptitude .
as a result the panel , which has been holding a series of meetings after the gujarat quake , is not chaired by anyone .
collective decisions , smirk party circles , do not behove congressmen .
deferred donations bhubaneswar : politicians are responding with alacrity to help the earthquake victims of gujarat .
but what happened to their consciences when the devastating cyclone ripped through orissa in 1999 and killed thousands ?
so much for social commitment .
how long before i pick up equestrian skills , the portly leader asked .
retorted an andhra pradesh riding club member : we do n ' t have an elephant in our stables .
a wife , a mother , a woman scorned , she ' s playing them all on the big screen .
all the thinking ' s helping .
the son also rises
he ' s got the looks and the genes .
mom ' s lessons are just not enough .
the film ' s just out , but the delay has n ' t lowered the expectations from varma .
we are more than happy with her performance . "
better late than never .
amma calling it ' s a time - tested formula . wooing voters with star power .
anything to please amma .
last week i witnessed a minor municipal miracle in mumbai .
if this transformation was achieved for the benefit of ordinary citizens , mumbai ' s municipal commissioner would qualify for a national award .
sadly , it was not for us citizens that he worked so hard but for the prime minister who was coming to review a naval parade .
why should they ?
it is the business of businessmen to do business and the business of government to invest in development .
this is so absurd that we may just as well start privatising the prime minister ' s office or the ministries of home , defence and finance .
private money will undoubtedly go the same way .
information technology minister pramod mahajan is one of them .
but now not only does india have five million mobile connections but every party leader , minister and worker is also using the device .
karnataka chief minister s . m . krishna apparently boycotted the function because his name was not mentioned on the invitation card .
fernandes waited in vain for his call to be returned .
dramatic persona lucknow : critics see a gimmick in everything that uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh does these days .
they point out , for example , how at his daily janata darshan recently , singh touched the feet of his old teacher and took him inside his residence .
and how last week when singh was given a crown of gold at a public meeting , he promptly donated it to a poor widow .
but for the bjp leader , the cruellest blow perhaps is that his foes liken his ways to former prime minister v . p . singh ' s .
but naidu worries this will cut him off from the masses .
bravado or quintessential populism ?
for vallabhaneni venkateswara rao it was the end of the road .
and there were hardly any buyers for his crop of paddy .
in orissa , a 75 - kg bag of rice could fetch only rs 330 - or even less - as against the rs 382 fixed by the government .
orissa chief minister naveen patnaik even wrote to the centre , protesting against the discriminatory treatment to punjab , but to no avail .
and that made the terms of trade ( ratio of prices farmers pay for what they buy and prices they get for what they sell ) favourable to agriculture .
but problems other than pricing have become more pressing .
wage costs ( up to 60 per cent of the costs of agriculture ) have risen fastest in the 1990s .
in some states prices of diesel , power and fertiliser have also risen somewhat .
so , one minute autonomy is the worst thing in the world . the next minute we are ready to talk about azadi .
one minute we cannot talk to pakistan and the very next minute we are ready to talk to the pawns in its proxy war in the valley .
anniversaries , resolutions and new beginnings are the hobby - horse of the unrepentant optimist .
evidently , india is made of sterner stuff .
it now contemplates august 15 with a replay of kandahar in miniature .
the indian foreign service ( ifs ) had always prided itself on being far more in tune with the times than its domestic counterparts in the bureaucracy .
but male chauvinism was its blind side .
iyer smiles knowingly at you and asks , " i do n ' t quite look like the battering ewe that broke the glass ceiling , do i ? "
iyer wants to be well prepared when she assumes office on march 12 , after man singh leaves for the us as india ' s ambassador .
little doubt .
in the past three years , under prime minister a . b . vajpayee and his external affairs minister jaswant singh , indian foreign policy has undergone tectonic shifts .
much of this is because the prime minister ' s office has played an overarching role in foreign affairs over the years .
dixit regards her as a " sober , thoughtful and practical person not given to flights of articulation .
she is not flamboyant but a quiet , methodical and systematic worker " .
all these should stand the foreign office ' s first woman boss in good stead in the turbulent times ahead .
but the respite is temporary .
the big sister is worried , for the d ( as in depravity ) day has come .
sorry , it ' s a misplaced worry .
it ' s the same old , tired - and tiring - argument on india vs the countercultural viruses from abroad .
it ' s the administrative - and non - violent - version of the anti - valentine ' s day demonstration of hindu rashtra ' s lunatic fringe .
in the ftv case too , the fear of the anatomy police defies both logic and commonsense .
to assume that ftv - watchers are at the risk of losing their indian cultural identity is to underestimate the cultural integrity of the indian .
by that logic , quite a few indians should have lost their indianness long ago , what with hollywood , the internet and other easily accessible demons .
some have even committed suicide .
in cyclone - ravaged orissa , farmers ca n ' t find takers for their paddy because rice from punjab has flooded the state .
tea growers in tamil nadu are selling their produce way below cost .
coconut farmers in kerala are dumping unsold stocks on roadsides .
unfolding in the past few months is the largest and most enigmatic agriculture crisis faced by independent india .
in essence , the crisis is nothing more than a noble vision gone horribly wrong .
in the early 1990s , the problem with indian agriculture was diagnosed as rising farm subsidies and ( as a result of that ) falling investment .
the solution : improve returns from agriculture so that farmers ' dependence on subsidies is reduced .
the funds released from subsidies could then be ploughed back into agriculture .
consequently , the minimum support price of wheat was doubled while that of rice was raised by 110 per cent between 1991 - 92 and 1999 - 2000 .
that made foodgrain cultivation more rewarding but did n ' t help reduce the subsidies .
it has acceded in principle to the demand of its mlas for a limited mahajot ( grand alliance ) with the trinamool congress , an nda constituent .
these mlas are mainly from kolkata and south bengal where congress workers have en masse joined the trinamool .
according to party circles , these developments signal a new era of flexibility in the congress ' approach to alliances .
in west bengal , the party ' s readiness to dismount the high horse of unalloyed secularism was primarily a result of pressure from its mlas .
" there is only anti - left front space and mamata has evicted us from there . "
sonia ' s constant interactions with cpi ( m ) general secretary harkishan singh surjeet have also compromised the party ' s feeble anti - left credentials .
in tamil nadu , the congress also desperately needs to ride the crest with the aiadmk .
earlier this month she embarrassed the congress by admitting the pmk into the alliance without consulting it .
she also offered a measly 10 seats to the congress in the first round of talks .
a miffed congress imagined it could bolster its bargaining clout by entering into a pact with the tmc .
jayalalitha punctured this strategy by offering the congress and the tmc a total of 40 seats .
since the tmc has 37 mlas in the outgoing assembly , the offer threw the party into a dilemma .
she also decided to exploit the congress ' keenness to retain its government in pondicherry .
she offered it 12 out of the 33 seats in the union territory in lieu of foregoing its share in tamil nadu .
this quota would be three seats more than what the pmk and the aiadmk would be contesting .
it is not just jayalalitha who has been exploiting the divided tncc .
such a front would split anti - incumbency votes and indirectly help the dmk alliance retain power .
without mamata ' s help in west bengal , the congress is unlikely to get more than a handful of its 52 mlas re - elected .
in the 1996 assembly elections the party won 83 seats but that was before mamata broke away .
in 1999 , it won three lok sabha seats , polling 13 per cent .
but its success was confined to three muslim - dominated districts of north bengal .
likewise in tamil nadu , the party , as an aiadmk ally , polled 9 per cent votes and got two mps elected in 1999 .
if it is forced to go it alone , it may fare as dismally as it did in 1998 .
q . does n ' t your nomination to the upper house run against the people ' s will ?
a . losing and winning is part of politics .
after all , i won the lok sabha elections twice .
so one loss does n ' t mean the end of the road for me .
moreover , my party has nominated me .
q . your opponents see your nomination as perpetuation of dynastic politics .
a . that ' s false propaganda .
i have not been thrust upon the people by my father , nor am i a paratrooper politician .
unlike the gandhi family members , i have slogged at the grassroots level .
q . does punjab stand to gain with your nomination ?
a . as a former minister , i got several projects sanctioned for the state .
i will closely pursue and monitor them and raise issues concerning punjab .
q . are n ' t you too young to be in the house of elders ?
a . times have changed .
q . given a choice , will you prefer to be in parliament or in state politics ?
a . politics is now my full - time vocation .
and i will work wherever the party wants me .
some of them prospered after independence .
in the late 1930s , these youngsters were convinced that the union jack would soon make room for the red flag in delhi .
indrajit gupta too was successful in a way .
in 1996 , gupta became the first communist to occupy the powerful office of the union home minister .
however , gupta ' s real contribution is more to the values of political india than to the leftist universe .
after returning to india , he wrote to the party , offering his services " in any suitable capacity " .
on the contrary , he dutifully performed his underground tasks under the alias surya , given to him by the party ' s " technical cell " .
in fact , he drafted the main resolution of the dange loyalists .
if balathal surprised archaeologists with its skeletons , gilund has excited them with its massive burnt - brick structures .
even balathal and ojiyana had sun - dried mud - brick and stone structures and fortifications .
in stone structures , mud bricks were often used to raise partition walls .
there are high - built stone platforms on the eastern edge .
mud and cow dung were used as plaster - as villagers use them even today .
the mud bricks were often of the same length but narrow and slimmer .
the balathal and gilund settlements also show incipient planning with a wide street and a narrow lane dividing the residential complexes .
at balathal , there are remains of a wall that probably surrounded the residential complex and a fortified structure in the centre of the habitation .
like harappan citadels , it is built over mud - brick platforms , and fortification walls are broadened towards the base .
gilund had long and wide parallel walls .
one complex is of 8,000 sq ft , and there are more like it around .
says shinde : " the harappans did help them flourish but the farmers retained their culture intact . ' '
it was a mixed economy based on farming , stock raising , hunting , fowling and fishing .
wild animals such as nilgai and blackbuck constituted 5 per cent .
remains of pig , fish , turtle and molluscs were also found .
a large number of bones were charred and split open , perhaps to extract arrows .
m . d . kajale of the same college found that the cultivated plants included wheat , barley , lentil , common pea , finger millet and italian millet .
mishra says others took to stock breeding and became gadris ( shepherds ) and rabaris ( camel breeders ) .
then there are communities like the gemetis , meghwals and bawarias who continue to practise their traditional occupation of hunters to this day .
some of them used to eat carrion until a few decades ago .
the odhnis of gameti women bear a tell - tale resemblance to the trademark red - and - black pottery of ahar culture .
and evidence of the folk religion of the ahars survives among the kalbelias , the community to which the dancer gulabo , famed in rajasthani folklore , belonged .
the ahars are n ' t dead .
they still live among us .
besides , at the end of the day , they too will have access to cheaper funds .
there is also good news for the consumers - lower interest rates mean cheaper hire purchase .
the moral : what ' s good for the government is good for the individual .
writing a political column is a tricky business .
if the subject is controversial - like sonia gandhi ' s qualifications to rule india - the problem becomes acute .
privatisation is an attempt to rectify priorities that have gone completely awry but the congress opposes this as do our marxist parties .
if the balco sale goes ahead , it will be only the second government company to be sold - the other being a bakery called modern food industries ltd .
sonia is apparently so passionately against privatisation that one of her few speeches in the lok sabha was provoked by the sale of the bakery .
then also , as they are doing now , congress mps following their leader shouted about the family silver being sold for a song .
so , transparency is not the issue .
and the congress now tells us that it opposes it fundamentally .
so , the shenanigans in parliament are nothing but a joke - an attempt to mislead the public .
dhindsa ' s supporters will point out the bcci is an autonomous body .
other than the truly cretinous , nobody will argue that the government should take over the running of cricket and , in effect , nationalise the bcci .
is he up to it ?
the explosive hamoodur rehman report , suppressed by successive pakistani governments , has never been disclosed - until now .
it ' s true india played a big part in training the bangladeshi army of liberation - - the mukti bahini .
it ' s also true indira gandhi finally ordered general sam manekshaw ' s men to " liberate " east pakistan .
indian farmers face serious problems but these are the result of an accumulation of bad policies over many , many years .
besides , all that the farmers ' rally was treated to were polemics and populism .
this is exactly the kind of politics we do not need .
for those who have lamented the erosion of ideology in politics , that would be a heartening development .
tragically , the recognition of privatisation as a political issue is confined to those who still nurture nehruvian dreams and marxist delusions .
the champions of disinvestment have been unable to gauge the political potential of their actions and have taken refuge behind a wall of bureaucratic obfuscation .
if the recent controversy over balco is any indication , the government persuaded the cognoscenti but did n ' t quite win the political battle .
it bolstered a perception that underneath the gloss of disinvestment lay the murkiness of crony capitalism .
the government ' s initial lack of openness encouraged this thinking .
at one point he even considered scrapping the deal rather than have a question mark put on his integrity .
though shourie ' s personal integrity and vajpayee ' s unflinching support finally saved the day on balco , the government has lessons to learn .
it is now clear that the disinvestment department ' s obsessive secrecy must give way to full transparency verging on an information overload .
the government must not only be above board , it must be seen to be so .
although the proposal was shot down by the cabinet last month , it fuelled fears of privatisation becoming a euphemism for cronyism .
this , coupled with inter - corporate rivalries and the disquiet over the intrusiveness of the prime minister ' s office vitiated the air during the balco sale .
for the government , the core problem seems to be the lack of a political approach .
it has opted for disinvestment by diktat , a politically unviable approach .
on both these counts , it suffers from a failure of communication and more .
it not only makes it difficult for any of these groups to train recruits but also for them to get fresh members , supporters or donors .
already , there is criticism surrounding the act and civil - liberty groups are jumping into the fray .
india , however , has to put the act in perspective .
moreover , the question of the effectiveness of such bans in curbing terrorism remains .
the us ban on the harkat - ul - ansar following the kidnapping of five foreign tourists was not very encouraging .
the group ' s activities continue unabated in kashmir .
the uk ban will no doubt put some pressure on the target organisations which may even be forced to go underground .
but viewed through the ground realities of kashmir , the ban may not make a sizeable difference .
for the second successive year passenger fares have not been raised .
instead , there is a 3 per cent increase on already high freight rates .
with seven of the 24 new trains beginning their journey in her home state , mamata ' s budget is quite obviously a west bengal election manifesto .
the lady may or may not win a majority in the next assembly . the point is , indian railways will be in trouble regardless .
what is the assumption behind mamata ' s accountancy ?
every year , 4.5 billion people - four indias - use mamata ' s trains .
their capacity to pay can never match user cost and a subsidy is inherent .
has this happened ?
in 2000 - 01 , the commercial exploitation of the railways ' optic fibre system was supposed to be the key to " other earnings " .
over the past year rail tel , the subsidiary agency created for the job , has become yet another parasitic bureaucracy .
they are among the few surviving structures from a part of the world that was once india but is now lost to it ; forever .
what is happening in afghanistan is scarcely different .
historically afghanistan was a repository of buddhist and , later , shaivite art and tradition .
the effacement of this heritage is not merely a concern for india ' s revanchists .
it is a rape of mankind ' s collective legacy .
from a buddhist stupa in central kabul to 15th century islamic minarets in herat , little has been spared .
till the mid - 1990s , the kabul museum housed 1,00,000 artefacts and was among the most important treasuries of , well , indology .
today only 20 per cent of this collection is traceable .
it may take decades but surely tranquillity will some day descend on afghanistan .
till then history is at the mercy of the pillaging taliban .
delhi : the equations in 10 janpath are undergoing a sea change .
the overwhelming feeling is that he deserved it .
officials in the chief minister ' s office say this would " go well in keeping with the silicon valley image of bangalore " .
most legislators , however , do not know what to do with these gizmos .
they would have been a far happier lot if the government had helped them replace their ageing ambassadors with shiny new lancers .
raipur : ajit jogi keeps himself up to date with all graft cases .
but after ' diggy ' helped him become the chief minister of chhattisgarh , he denied he ever said it .
insiders wonder how long will it be before he withdraws his rs 100 crore graft charge against the pmo .
fifty years in which the main beneficiaries have been government officials .
this is half the money the government collects in taxes .
the ministry performs a list of other useless tasks and if it ceased to function tomorrow nobody would notice it .
close it down , mr finance minister , and do the taxpayers a real favour .
again , the real solution is perhaps to close them down and chuck the officials into the surplus pool .
any conversation with the ministers about downsizing is likely to result in a sushma swaraj - type reaction .
who wants to lose their jobs ?
why not , for instance , a single ministry of transport to include railways , aviation and roads ?
mamata banerjee ' s populism would be much easier to curtail and we might even be able to off - load air india and indian airlines .
why not just one ministry of trade and industry instead of a whole lot of useless , little ones ?
but what about jobs for the boys , you will say , how can he keep his national democratic alliance together if he cannot make party leaders into ministers ?
will such excesses become history at the stroke of a pen ?
they fear though that chances of perquisites remaining tax - free are slim .
the official view is quite stern .
he confirmed that following changes in evaluation rules of perquisites , their tax - free components will shrink .
according to tax experts , the changes will come under the following heads of income .
# signing - on payments : from nil tax obligation , these payments will now be fully taxable .
the entire amount may come under tax .
the perk seems destined to become taxable .
# interest subsidy and interest - free loan : the government is unlikely to tamper with interest - free loans because of a supreme court order .
it is expected that this perquisite will now be evaluated on a single basis .
if it is evaluated as a share of the basic salary , the share is likely to be doubled to 20 per cent .
the value may be trebled .
# driver ' s salary : the rs 300 per month taxed for driver ' s salary is likely to be doubled .
even assuming that allowances are left untouched , the budget has triggered a new thinking on the gamut of tax - free handouts that go with many job contracts .
the cash component may still rule high because there is no signal yet that the government is going to tax reimbursements .
it is challenged , if at all , on a random basis .
the income - tax department does n ' t have the resources to check out every restaurant bill or every air ticket claimed as expense .
the expense - account culture may be curbed only after strict limits are put on reimbursements , thus making compliance irrespective of policing .
who let the dogs out ?
except in this case they are likely to ask : who let the bears out ?
the next day it rose by another 24 points .
but they had not contended with party poopers .
suddenly , on march 2 the sensex plummeted by 176 points .
the ostensible reason was the bloodbath on the nasdaq .
they would rather believe the rumours - ranging from defaults to big bull ketan parekh ' s arrest .
the ripples did n ' t take long to touch north block .
perturbed by the tremors rocking the market , the finance ministry cracked its whip .
even as they sniffed around , the sensex plunged by a further 96 points to 3998 on march 5 .
it was clear that the 250 - plus crash had very little to do with the slump on the nasdaq .
for well over a year , the bulls had used the tech boom to keep the bears at bay .
by march 2 , there was so much pressure on the bulls that they began unloading wildly when markets reopened on march 5 .
this was just what the bears were waiting for .
but they got the timing wrong again .
it was too close after the budget and stirred a reaction they had not bargained for .
sebi ' s investigation reveals a trail of skulduggery that is shocking .
the conversation was recorded by the in - built security system of the surveillance section .
by wednesday evening sebi served rathi the ultimatum : resign or be sacked .
rathi chose to resign and declared his " intention to fight for justice " .
sebi also defanged the bear operators by ordering a ban on all forward sales unless backed by delivery .
this included information from depositories , trading rooms of fis , sebi and friendly bankers .
many bull operators simply tapped profit - crazy bankers to write out cheques and guarantees . "
if balco is re - nationalised and taken away from its legal buyer , jogi says he will withdraw operation sabotage .
else , he has threatened to revoke balco ' s mining licence and disrupt its water supply .
this is not politics ; it is the marriage of anarchism and blackmail .
he insisted the actual worth was rs 5,500 crore .
as the chief minister of a young , mineral - rich state , he should be wooing private investment rather than threatening it .
his valuation of balco is as harebrained as his claim that the privatisation programme is designed to destabilise congress - led state governments .
state pcc leaders are putting up a brave front after this second exodus to the trinamool ( the first happened post - 1997 ) .
" i do n ' t call this a split , " says pcc chief pranab mukherjee .
" it wo n ' t make any difference to us . "
ever since mamata broke away to form the trinamool in 1997 , there has been a string of desertions from the congress .
in the previous assembly elections , the undivided congress had 40.21 per cent vote share .
in the 1998 and 1999 parliamentary elections , both held after formation of the trinamool , it dropped to 15 and 13 per cent respectively .
as east pakistan bled and millions were made refugees in india , there was rejoicing in the west .
" thank god , pakistan is saved , " crowed bhutto .
the major part of the army behaved as professional soldiers . "
but the un human rights commission in its 1981 report said the genocide in bangladesh was one of the worst in history .
in his memoirs , general a . a . k . niazi blamed yahya khan , bhutto and general headquarters ( ghq ) for letting the eastern command down .
the commission blamed yahya , niazi and the ghq for the defeat in dacca .
a . parliament had come to a standstill and wild allegations had been levelled against me , including being called a thief .
i shudder at the thought at what they must have done to the entire security system of our country .
it could serve the interests of foreign countries .
a . on the contrary i have succeeded in a great measure in cleaning up the ministry .
this whole thing is the result of it .
now arms merchants and middlemen have no access .
the president of the mighty bharatiya janata party grabbing huge wads of notes and stashing them away like a petty thief .
his defence : it ' s normal to collect party funds in this fashion .
so many people come and see me and they donate money , what is wrong ?
a great deal , mr bangaru laxman , a very great deal , and it ' s just as well you resigned .
worse , we have that ultimate protector of the great hindu rashtra , the rss , also implicated in power broking and dirty deals .
could the government fall ?
who knows ?
but if it survives then the prime minister really needs to show us what he can do .
what is required is a visible attempt to change the system .
is it the funeral fragrance of power that is wafting across indraprastha ?
this is abundantly true in the evolutionary saga of messrs bangaru laxman and george fernandes .
remember his brotherly call to the muslims ?
it takes only a few currency notes to turn a symbol into a shame .
the bjp cannot even call it an embarrassment of riches .
and social correctness wo n ' t allow it to add an appropriate adjective to the embarrassment either .
but stained george , being a socialist with diminished causes , suffers from no embarrassment .
today the georgian morality looks as crumpled as the georgian kurta .
external affairs minister jaswant singh was then persuaded to send him to canada as the high commissioner .
advani gave his nod to shourie for appointment of singh to an innocuous post in india .
much to his dismay , he saw singh back in the pmo , in the same room as before , and with the same power .
the excuse given was that the mps were targeted by the tamil tiger suicide cadres who had opposed the package since the beginning .
the unp also seems to have closely studied the counter - strategies adopted by indian parties to ward off defections .
for , fearing that many more would either cross over or be bought , the party flew 11 mps to singapore .
another important provision in the proposed constitution which drew severe criticism from the sinhala hardliners was the selection of two vice - presidents from the ethnic minorities .
the protesters took out several rallies that clogged colombo ' s streets .
realising that the strategy was not working and fearing that the bill would be defeated , kumaratunga pulled back .
thanks to the centuries - old practice of the city ' s marwari finance capital , badla financing is almost entirely dependent on an unofficial lending system .
it provides finance , now at 32 per cent annually , for the speculators to carry forward their bookings from one settlement week to another .
the bankas met with a tragic end probably because of an exorbitant commitment beyond the dabba .
admits cse president kamal parekh : ' ' the unofficial badla rate has overshadowed the official .
it is a fact of life . ' '
the current problem is somewhat different .
outside the building , there was no way that they could trace singhania , poddar or biyani .
one of them had reportedly been admitted to belle vue hospital , but the hospital authorities had no clue about it .
the overhang of the unofficial debt , though , persists .
the sources of such debt are bizarre .
it is different from mumbai , where relatively transparent corporate funds are in use for speculation .
he ' s seen it up close , smelt it all around him for 20 years ; and the aroma has usually been heady .
things have n ' t drifted george ' s way over the past one year .
in early 2000 he had expected a nomination to the rajya sabha .
the findings of the investigations matured into a full - fledged fir on march 20 , 2001 , under the provisions of the prevention of corruption act .
the timing of lodging the fir may be questionable .
as congress mp ahmed patel put it , " it is a piece of political vendetta . "
still , it has proved acutely embarrassing for the party president .
the other co - accused in the case is abhishek verma , an nri businessman , who had used aggarwal to frame the jeweller .
the bureaucrat , the flamboyant businessman and the syrian christian stenographer who made good were quite a threesome in those days .
the cbi spoiled the party .
when aggarwal found himself in the law ' s net , he expected george to help extricate him from the mess .
the money - apparently siphoned off from the congress election budget of 1991 - had come to verma from george .
following verma ' s disclosure , and the subsequent interrogation of aggarwal , the cbi feels it has enough to tighten the noose around george .
sample the cbi ' s case .
in this period george spent rs 1.2 lakh , allowing him a savings potential of a maximum rs 7.64 lakh .
yet the george family ' s loose change is substantial .
in october 2000 , the cbi chanced upon a bank account in delhi in the name of one of george ' s minor children .
not bad , given george ' s sole fortune when he came to delhi was his ability to type fast .
george was quizzed at the cbi headquarters in delhi for nearly 20 hours over four visits in the summer of 2000 .
in the 1990s , he got himself registered as a voter in karnataka in the hope that the local congress would give him a rajya sabha seat .
as a result , he worked very hard on improving his technique for this final match - up .
each member has a different approach to readying themselves for a confrontation with an opposing tribe .
it is also my role to help bring the tribe together and summarise where our opportunities and weaknesses lie .
however , as the series had already proven , contentment with one ' s position can be shortlived .
till march 7 , sebi allowed the practice of what is called " naked short - selling " of shares .
speculators would sell huge quantities of shares without actually owning them .
the oversupply in the market would bring down the price and they would then buy the same shares at lower prices and book a handsome profit in the bargain .
this is how the bear cartel rigged the market for months , eventually leading to the crash .
of course , there was also the all - pervasive insider trading in the stock markets that sebi was blissfully unaware of for long .
" nothing will come out of it , but i will get some mental peace , " admits maheshwari .
the mushrooming of software and technology companies in the past two years is one instance of the failure of the department of company affairs .
after the cbi filed a disproportionate assets fir against him , the party is rallying around sonia gandhi ' s personal secretary .
he now has the privilege of youth congress greenhorns maintaining a round - the - clock vigil outside his d / 109 satya marg residence .
not to talk of the stream of high - profile ministers and mlas visiting him and chief ministers phoning him .
even his boss was sympathetic .
while george opted out of sonia ' s hong kong trip , he was allowed to see her off at the airport .
a political statement there ?
it also appears that in the past four years the population of the rhesus monkeys in delhi has gone up significantly .
" clearly they are not healthy monkeys , and they are essentially the ones that are biting people , " she says .
to make matters worse , post - bite care too is risky .
the government expectedly failed to stick to the march 31 , 2001 deadline .
with economic philosophy not quite a sangh core competence , sudarshan ' s interventions in this area were mystifying .
in particular , sudarshan ' s patronage of s . gurumurthy , swadeshi jagran manch ideologue , caused misgivings in government circles .
sudarshan recommended candidates for rajya sabha seats .
others can make their own choices . "
the effect of the morphine injection lasts just four hours .
long enough to touch her heart and the hearts of others .
by lakshmi iyer the congress likes nothing more than intrigues . what it loves above all are inner - party battles .
though sonia ' s managers manoeuvred to get their candidates through , the dissidents managed to score a point .
of the congress ' 172 mps - - lok sabha , 113 , rajya sabha , 59 - - 143 participated in the election .
the agp has been harping on the nexus for almost a year now .
last year , mahanta even submitted a formal memorandum to advani , accusing the congress and party ' s state president tarun gogoi of having links with the ulfa .
the ministry of home affairs initiated a probe but has failed to come up with evidence .
this has not prevented agp and bjp leaders from attacking the congress .
the reasons for the ulfa ' s anger against the agp are not far to seek .
more than 500 ulfa activists have been killed and 2,700 have surrendered since then .
these reverses inflicted a huge psychological blow to the organisation , which hastily claimed the surrenders were stage - managed .
" the ulfa has ceased to be the cohesive force it once was due to the sustained counter - insurgency offensive , " says an army officer .
the underground organisation waited for the elections to hit back .
the ulfa hopes the agp ' s defeat will bring a change in policies on dealing with insurgency .
the attacks in the past few weeks have shown the rebels mean business .
security officials have drawn up a list of 150 highly vulnerable candidates , 138 of whom belong to the agp and the bjp .
on may 2 , the authorities announced that 25 additional paramilitary companies were moving in .
the threat perception has quite clearly changed .
for the unified command in assam , protecting candidates is a big challenge .
the politicians themselves are not too worried .
advani knows only too well that the people of assam want peace .
whether the home minister ' s move proves counter - productive is yet to be seen but the congress has decided to hit back .
" the agp - bjp leadership has realised that our party is clearly on a comeback trail , " says ambika soni , aicc general secretary .
" accusing the congress of having a nexus with the ulfa is a sign of frustration on their part . "
the election commission , too , has drawn flak .
criticising the ec is probably a ploy to win that extra vote .
after all in politics , winning sympathy is often a matter of life - or death .
q . you have been laloo ' s " friend , philosopher and guide " since his college days .
what happened ?
a . laloo is a creation of the social justice platform .
all those who helped him or promoted him were either insulted or ousted from the party by him .
q . you and your colleagues have formed the rjd ( democratic ) .
is it big enough to oust laloo ?
a . this is just the beginning of the war between vikas ( development ) and vinash ( destruction ) .
on the question of development , i am ready to pay any price and face any consequence .
q . but you yourself have been instrumental in promoting laloo and protecting the laloo - rabri raj .
the future of bihar cannot be sacrificed for laloo ' s promotion .
a . it is below my standard to comment on people like tiwary .
i can only reply to laloo , though i will not use the kind of language he uses .
i am a cultured person , a university professor .
says saeed noori of the academy : " it uses the word nabi meaning prophet and among muslims no one can become a nabi .
noori added that he had nothing against mehndi .

initially the loyalists treated bano ' s victory as a foregone conclusion and concentrated on ensuring kalmadi ' s victory over sibal .
cpp spokesperson margaret alva even threw an election - eve dinner to canvass support for kalmadi .
on polling day , the loyalists changed priorities .
strategist arjun singh lobbied frenetically to ensure bano ' s defeat and the election of sibal and naresh pugalia as treasurer .
finally , sibal won by two votes .
at the end of it all , bano ' s defeat is hurting the dissidents .
instead , during the campaign , all we got were polemics and platitudes .
she was no exception .
these are cynical times indeed and because cynicism is infectious , we hacks have not escaped unscathed either .
but if you make up your mind on appearances you may make the biggest mistake of your life .
last year 16 students got into iims .
and this is absolutely normal here .
the faculty and excellent placement make srcc the ideal for any student pursuing a bachelor ' s degree in commerce or economics .
many are reputed authors of commerce books . "
says magti kotya , mother of four malnutritioned children : " we are always living on the edge , between life and death .
so far we have survived on hope and promises but cannot take it any longer .
unbearable it is , what with poverty , unemployment lack of food and drinking water and poor healthcare .
and yet , the concept of birth control is sadly lacking among the tribals .
the state government does provide about 2,5000 tonnes of grain and rs 25 crore worth of employment projects since october last year .
there ' s also over 200 million tonnes of grain in food corporation of india godowns , but the children continue to die of malnutrition .
the public distribution system , a veritable lifeline in these inaccessible areas , does n ' t exist on the map .
receiving healthcare is a nightmare . "
khadse ' s allegations are not without basis .
in december last year , the licenses of six shopkeepers in the area were revoked after the villagers complained of a ration racket .
the shopkeepers were caught when six truckloads of foodgrain meant for nandurbar tribals were seized near the gujarat border .
in another case , over 250 tonnes of foodgrain was sold to a couple of flour mills in gujarat .
besides , no time frame has been specified for submitting the report .
however , most of the 364 adivasi benefit schemes and 250 projects under the employment guarantee schemes ( egs ) remain on paper .
explains district guardian minister bala shiverakar : " the problem boils down to access and the vast distances between the villages .
it also plans to revive some long - term tribal welfare schemes .
the villagers can do little but wait .
however , till the government ensures that its schemes work and the benefits reach the 33,000 families children will continue to die .
there is no dispute over this : the judiciary continues to be an institution of last hope in this country .
perhaps the best way is to create a mechanism within to judge the judges .
doing good and doing enough are n ' t always the same .
not certainly when it comes to encouraging foreign direct investment ( fdi ) into india .
last week ' s lifting of floodgates for fdi is a good step .
in sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals to township development foreigners can now set up 100 per cent subsidiaries .
they can also control up to 74 per cent of telecom services like the isps .
even defence production - the most sacred bastion of swadeshi control - has been opened , though with caveats .
intriguingly , the print media still remains out of bounds for foreign investment .
for the government of india , the pen seems more dangerous than the sword .
actual annual fdi inflow since 1996 has averaged only $ 2.5 billion .
that ' s just about 5 per cent of the $ 45 billion fdi china gets every year .
reasons : bureaucracy , slow reforms and poor infrastructure .
investors , both foreign and indian , complain most of the bureaucratic hurdles .
foreign investors feel more flustered because they are not used to the hurdles .
not that they have to .
developing countries across the world are competing to offer a hassle - free business environment .
by neeraj mishra the strike has ended , but not the uncertainty .
not only that , the state government ' s case against the sale of the company to sterlite still awaits a decision in the supreme court .
but what is important is that a message went out that there was something fishy in the deal .
it was the same jogi who had claimed in march that he would not relent unless sterlite ' s majority stake in balco was diluted .
its claim : the fifth schedule of the constitution prohibits sale of lands owned by tribals and the entire balco plant at korba is on tribal land .
that makes the sale unconstitutional .
sterlite claims that it is being unfairly singled out whereas companies like daewoo and essar too have been given tribal land .
he is also examining the mining lease of hindalco and six other companies .
agarwal concedes that in the end he and all others related to the deal " will have to accept whatever the supreme court rules " .
for him balco is still a good bet .
" it ' s no longer viable to set up a new aluminium plant anywhere in the world .
mistakes typify indian economics .
i . k . gujral , whose government pushed through the fifth pay commission , now admits it was a serious mistake .
his admission was made to me in an interview on national tv .
every other politician went along because when it comes to economic matters , borrowed ideas from failed ideologies usually cloud judgement .
economics is such a confusing thing for the indian politician he tries to stay away from it .
the prolonged high drama over the fate of balco has cast its shadow over the future of privatisation .
one such comfort is the clearance of future privatisation deals from the states concerned .
this could create complications in cases in which the psu under the hammer has units in more than one state .
balco , for instance , has units in chhattisgarh and west bengal .
a greater involvement of states will certainly prolong the already long - winded procedure for privatisation .
it ' s also quite likely that the government may not get the full payment for its future sales in psu equity upfront .
the buying company would stagger the payment in such a way that the full payment is made only when the sold business is completely transferred to it .
on its part , the central government is hoping that the shadow of balco does not extend beyond the next couple of deals .
if the privatisation process moves smoothly from now , most of the apprehensions generated by the balco controversy will be laid to rest .
that , claim disinvestment ministry officials , is the biggest hope for the future success of privatisation .
if unearthed , it would be the first such archaeological find in the gulf of cambay .
" it was an accidental discovery , " says ravindran .
" we were doing some pollution check for a private company and our teams were collecting routine data .
and here we are with clinching evidence of a lost settlement perhaps 6,000 years old . "
the confirmation is yet to come , but the findings are astounding .
one of the images shows structures like tanks , some square and 40 m long , some 41 m by 25 m .
there is even an image of a 44 m - long structure resembling a temple with a pond .
the side scan sonar could not have given better photographs under the turbulent waters where sand currents make imaging extremely difficult .
" the monsoon over , we got back with more equipment doing sub - bottom profiles of the structures , " says ravindran .
" the results were hair - raising . "
the sub - bottom profiler , which penetrates deep under the seabed to give a cross - section view , confirmed the acropolis structure .
a similar profile of the " settlement " site showed structures with well - designed basements .
" see , " badrinarayan points his finger still shaking with excitement , " taller structures have deeper basements .
those old guys , i should admit , were great engineers . "
rounded pebbles suggest that one or many rivers had run their course through the now - submerged region .
that virtually every ancient civilisation flourished on river banks adds to the validity of the niot find .
archaeological studies of the gujarat coast suggest that places like lothal were port cities as the ocean extended till there .
then how come the structures now identified by niot were submerged ?
according to a note prepared by the organisation , the most probable answer is earthquakes .
research conducted by centre for earth science studies , thiruvananthapuram , confirm that earthquakes have brought down land level by several metres .
gupta contacted union hrd minister murli manohar joshi who was equally excited at the preliminary evidence .
" it could unearth a harappan or pre - harappan civilisation , " he says .
however , experts advise caution .
says rao , " unless there is definite datable object we cannot say it is as old as the harappan civilisation . "
finding datable objects poses a challenge for niot .
moreover , these vessels do not have a dynamic positioning system that enables stability while handling crawlers and other heavy equipment .
kathiroli recounts the many times their vessel was grounded as the depth of the sea suddenly decreased by more than 10 m .
carrying the shallow - bed crawler that weighs 10 tonnes will need more powerful engine and at least 50 sq m of free deck space .
" we need a bigger sea - going vessel with ample space and power , " says ravindran .
the cost factor is another impediment .
the investment might be worth it .
the cambay find needs a lot more evidence to give it shape .
also , it is important to get datable pottery .
we established dwarka to date back to 1600 b . c . through thermoluminescence .
sending divers 40 m deep to collect samples is a trying proposition .
the exploration of dwarka in 1981 looks like child ' s play compared to this operations .
divers could spend a long time underwater collecting material from the dwarka site , which is just 5 m deep .
even expert divers from the indian navy cannot stay underwater for more than 20 minutes in the interregnum between the tides .
hence , the need for rovs and sea - bed crawlers .
at present , niot has a battery - operated rov with a 5 - hp engine , which is grossly inadequate to deal with the 8 - knot currents .
also , the shallow - bed crawler can videograph and pump out sediment samples from the ocean bed to the vessel .
and perhaps the best catch ever for any marine archaeologist .
the border security force ' s intelligence wing , g branch , has also been cleared for equipment upgradation aimed at strengthening its aviation wing .
by giving a green signal for additional manpower and equipment , the government has in effect injected more funds into the agency .
this is aimed at gathering better intelligence in the insurgency - hit areas of kashmir and the north - east .
resources will be provided to train ib personnel for decoding cyber messages and to equip them with better linguistic skills .
headed by a director - general , it will come under the proposed chief of defence staff establishment and designated deputy chief of defence staff ( intelligence ) .
he will have the army , navy and air intelligence wings under him and will give intelligence assessment to the nsa .
the defence imagery processing and analysis centre , a satellite - based intelligence unit , will also come under the dia .
it will obtain and interpret satellite pictures of target areas from the department of space to facilitate military operations .
for aerial reconnaissance and photography , the dia will rely on the indian air force ' s mig - 25 r , avros and canberra aircraft .
a section of the intelligence community feels there wo n ' t be much change as only the top spectrum has been changed .
however , making the intelligence heads accountable at least makes for a good beginning .
q . are you agreeable to talks on all aspects of indo - pakistan relations and not just kashmir ?
through a realistic approach , we hope to find a solution acceptable to the kashmiri people .
unless it is acceptable to them nothing can be achieved .
q . but with the two sides ' positions well defined , is there anything to talk about ?
a . we are , as i said , going with an open mind .
i believe unless a conversation is started we cannot decide what is worth discussing .
now we can find what the approach is , and the best thing is for the two leaders to talk to and probe each other ' s minds .
q . are you optimistic of progress ?
a . if either side is pessimistic , then we should call off the talks .
it is far worse to go ahead with the talks and then be embittered .
as far as i ' m concerned , we will make all efforts to see that an agreement can be reached .
your prime minister too strikes us as being upfront and open .
q . at the same time you have been critical of india ' s ending the cease - fire in kashmir .
a . we have received with consternation india ' s decision to unceremoniously end the cease - fire and resume military operations .
the indian government is using alarming words which gives the indian army a blank cheque to continue state terrorism against the kashmiri people .
we hope india will reconsider its decision .
after all , initiating a proposal to have a dialogue and then to start an aggressive operation on the same day is contradictory .
you end up taking one step forward and two steps backward .
q . but india blames pakistan as the reason for ending the cease - fire .
a . that ' s convenient to say but look at the facts .
on december 2 , general musharraf announced we would maintain stability on the loc and ordered a cease - fire .
pakistan forces also withdrew much behind the lines .
we expected a similar restraint in the indian - occupied kashmir but unfortunately it did n ' t happen .
we had also called for a consultative process with the all - party hurriyat conference .
india kept saying it might allow them to come to islamabad but it ' s over five months now and there has been no decision .
so it is unrealistic and incorrect to blame us for what is happening in kashmir .
mascarenhas says of that accusation , " there are no investigations on in sri lanka .
it ' s one guy fighting with another guy and we were caught in the middle .
the lankan attorney general said that far back as 1998 . "
about the charges in india he replies , " we ' ve gone before each and every investigating authority .
it is unfortunate that a disgruntled board politician has made these wild , baseless and horribly damaging allegations .
that ' s the price one has to pay in a very visible business . "
in a business of hard - nosed hustle , mascarenhas has returned to prove he is still a contender .
punjab chief minister parkash singh badal likened the wto to the capital ' s mysterious monkey man .
even prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , who presided over the meeting , could not help guffawing .
lucknow : the goings on in the ruling bjp in uttar pradesh suggest there is little need for an opposition in the state .
and chief minister rajnath singh appears to be a helpless head of government .
out to cultivate a " press friendly " image , the jat chieftain has recently been at his " pr best " .
how long this good patch in his love - hate equation with the media lasts is anybody ' s guess .
chennai : aiadmk factotums are known to prostrate themselves before jayalalitha jayaram .
so why did n ' t they do it after she won the recent polls ?
apparently , there were " standing instructions " not to bend before amma , at least in public .
the scam was brewing a while . but somehow the warning signals went unheeded .
teachers at several centres were not being paid .
says rahul gupta , instructor at kanada ' s centre : " we have not received pay cheques for the past few months . "
adds his colleague , programmer ashish chadha : " we were told that the company was going through a financial crisis .
ground realities , however , suggested it was n ' t true . "
the franchisees ( fearing underworld retribution they do not want to be named ) were not getting their returns .
in direct contrast we have states like bihar and uttar pradesh .
these are states that are poor due entirely to bad governance .
uttar pradesh could , if it had one decent government , make all the money it needs solely from tourism .
it has the taj mahal , benares and more .
but it has n ' t had a chief minister who has thought of tourism as a possible means of strengthening the economy .
in 1947 , bihar was considered our best governed state .
patna is about the only state capital in india which does not have a single , decent hotel .
murtaza ' s track record suggests that so far he has been lucky .
last year , he was arrested in vadodara for cheating a franchisee .
" we believe that most of the software used in zap centres is pirated , " says dcp singh .
mithani ' s " undesirable " dubai connections have also become a cause for concern .
says senior inspector ( social service ) shirish inamdar : " we are wary of his activities .
besides , i have nothing to do with computer education .
i ' m in the field of communications . "
calcium levels are digitally scored .
less than 100 and the patient can heave a sigh of relief .
scores of 100 - 400 imply it is time to get worried , while scores greater than 400 mean danger .
" one of us , " is how the general is being described by many in the valley .
unlike pant whose dialogue is being dubbed as another " political stunt " .
the issue is the resolution of the kashmir dispute , not development and employment . "
the hurriyat , even governor g . c . saxena concedes , " represents a certain section that cannot be ignored " .
even shabir shah , a hurriyat opponent , says , " pant can only listen to us and put our views across to the prime minister .
he cannot solve the kashmir dispute .
that can only be arrived at with pakistan ' s help , and vajpayee has proved this by inviting musharraf . "
the impression that pakistan would have a role to play had been gaining ground through the cease - fire phase .
says director general of police a . k . suri : " foreigners have taken complete control of the insurgency .
if 35 per cent of the militants being killed earlier were foreigners , the figure shot up to 65 per cent during the cease - fire . "
militants targeted their key informers apart from conducting daring attacks on nerve centres demoralising personnel .
it is in this environment that the centre is trying to keep the peace initiative moving .
the cease - fire was called off on the ground but as a senior police officer says , " the people see it as a militant victory .
in kashmir , they side with whoever they think is powerful . ' '
now , the landless ali has left jamila with her parents and moved to gujarat to earn a livelihood .
raven - haired reshma , 20 , of mekan ka par village in barmer became a widow in the first year of marriage .
her father mitha khan had married her off to 10 - year - old resham khan , a tb patient , for rs 60,000 .
resham ' s father hassan khan needed someone to look after his ailing son and mitha had jumped at the offer .
what will reshma do now ? hassan has her life all chalked out .
" our society stipulates that widows remarry their brothers - in - law , " he says .
so reshma ' s next husband will be his second son akbar khan , 8 .
all in the name of " social justice " .
do we need to condone what uttar pradesh and bihar have done to themselves by giving them more money ?
do we need to punish states that have worked hard to provide decent governance and decent standards of living ?
the chief ministers who met in delhi last week should now concentrate on evolving a new way of looking at centre - state finances .
it is also worth asking whether a blind numbers approach is the correct - indeed , only - way to ensure a stable population .
in february 2000 , the union government accommodated the very views in the national population policy .
gujarat ca n ' t pretend this document does n ' t exist .
more temples are believed to be buried in what appears to be a massive complex .
hence figures of hindu gods in a jain temple are common .
while the upper portion of the sandstone temple , including the shikhar and the dome , was found amid rubble , the lower portion is intact .
the entrance is flanked by idols of lord shiva ( with a damru in hand ) and his wife parvati .
on the inner walls are idols of lord ganesh , hanuman and goddess lakshmi .
the front has a sequence of the samudra manthan ( churning of the sea ) in which two groups of elephants are shown churning the sea with ropes .
among the buried figures that have been extricated are the twin idols of tirthankars parshavanath and supaarshavanath , carved from a single marble stone .
the idols have a cobra over their heads signifying jain god dharnenda , the lord of paataal ( the nether world ) .
suddenly , his companion - the local tracker - taps him on his shoulder .
jhala jerks his head up to see the shining eyes of the alpha ( dominant ) male in the enveloping darkness .
a few metres ahead a smaller animal , the alpha female , forages in the shadows .
next morning , under a glittering - blue sky , an investigation of the pack ' s den confirms his fears .
it has been burnt and stuffed with thorns .
later , he ' d returned with more accomplices , smoked the pups out and smashed their heads with a lathi .
" this kind of killing is a common occurrence , " says jhala , who is known for his iconoclastic studies on indian wolves .
the outer wall on the southern side of the temple has some disfigured images .
a canadian television team tried to get me to say on camera last week that the indian justice system was evil .
i hesitated to use the word evil on camera .
i admitted that the system was corrupt , ineffectual , malleable and thereby unjust but balked at using the word evil .
just take the uphaar case .
at the rate at which it is proceeding , it will be 20 years before justice is done .
even terrorists remain " under trial " for years .
in the indian airlines hijack case , we faced the humiliation of releasing terrorists who had been in jail for nearly five years .
in corruption cases , the law takes " its own course " so slowly that we are among the most corrupt countries in the world .
in statistical terms this means a backlog of cases that , according to some estimates , will take 324 years to clear .
the high courts have almost doubled their backlog in the past decade from 1.9 million cases in the early 1990s to 3.4 million today .
lower courts have a backlog of more than 20 million cases .
so what is the minister doing about this horrendous state of affairs ?
perhaps , the chief justice can tell us why before he retires in october .
there would be no need for an elected government if everything were to be done by the bureaucracy , he adds .
to add to marandi ' s woes , there is a growing desire among his ministers to live in plush bungalows and travel in air - conditioned cars .
a more than willing cabinet put its seal of approval on the issue on april 28 with changes to be implemented within a week .
the government is now spending about rs 90,000 every month on the perquisites and salary of each minister .
fed up with the growing conflict between the ministers and officials , the chief minister has now started monitoring their relationship .
vajpayee did not rake up the past in his 30 - minute meeting with mamata .
it is still not clear if she is not two - timing the bjp again .
while in delhi , she met sonia gandhi too though that visit did bring to the fore the differences within her party .
much of the confusion within the party stems from the inexplicable ambiguity in mamata ' s recent acts .
it is not even clear if her party actually quit the nda .
interestingly , the resolution has not been delivered till now to any constitutional functionary - the president , the prime minister or the lok sabha speaker .
her only tokens of " revolt " were her own resignation and that of panja from the union council of ministers .
" if this trend continues , we will soon lose the entire carnivore guild of kutch . "
wolves , even though they ' re known to be a hardy race , are on the endangered list of indian wildlife .
once they roamed around large parts of the country , scouring the landscape in numerous packs .
today , the northern tip of kutch holds the biggest wolf population in the country - and even that is threatened .
jhala ' s plan to save the indian wolf is twofold .
the other thrust of jhala ' s struggle is to build a national management strategy for wolves .
george is n ' t complaining though .
these days , he is n ' t tied down to 10 janpath for 16 to 18 hours a day as was the case earlier .
surely , nothing is going to change in the state congress if the wife replaces the husband .
but for the dissidents , it ' s going to be a coup no less .
a . i will meet old friends , specially the hindu brothers whom i missed so much all these years .
q . any political ambitions ?
i believe the electoral system in india is the mother of many ills that beset the country .
q . there ' s talk that your return will spark militancy .
the police are making a hue and cry for no reason since i stand for a non - violent democratic struggle .
q . how does it feel to be a failed revolutionary ?
a . what we saw in the past 20 years was part of a revolution that was started by guru nanak .
the idea of khalistan will not fail .
for three days the herd kept watch over the immobile 40 - year - old she elephant .
it was paralysed and its hind legs and pelvis fractured .
soon after , wildlife experts put the lactating elephant on a saline drip but she died on june 10 .
it is quite likely her calf will die too .
this is almost a replay of the death in the garumara - chapramari sanctuary in north bengal last year .
despite being administered painkillers and antibiotics , a 30 - year - old pachyderm had been able to hold out only for nine hours .
during the post mortem , a dead one - month - old calf had been extracted along with a " foreign metal " , possibly a bullet .
elephants are regularly mowed down by a metre - gauge train that runs through the wildlife sanctuaries of mahananda , garumara - chapramari , jaldapara and buxa tiger reserve .
as it happened last thursday when a goods train rammed into the mother elephant near rajabhatkhawa in the buxa forests .
the century - old 280 - km line connects new jalpaiguri in bengal to new bongaigaon in assam .
in 1999 , the northern frontier railway ( nfr ) decided to convert it to broad gauge .
it has also forced the central government to take notice .
for two days , the team travelled through the 43 - km stretch that passes through the sanctuaries .
according to its recommendations , if conversion of the railroad cannot be avoided then precautions should be taken .
other forest officials are more direct .
" just because the railways committed a mistake a century ago does n ' t mean it can do so again , " says a furious ranger .
" they should uproot the track and get out of our area . "
1 . a few days before the planned bombing , abdel raouf hawash was to survey the the precincts and issue the final go - ahead .
on the day of the attack , a sumo with a woman driver would head towards the visa section from shanti path .
at the same time , a maruti car laden with rdx would approach the visa section from nyaya marg .
the sumo would stop , its driver offer the maruti driver help .
the two women drivers would talk briefly before driving off in the sumo .
from the logistical and security point of view , agra is going to be a nightmare , and in terms of costs , the exercise is unwarranted .
after all , what is wrong with delhi , the national capital , as a no - nonsense business venue ?
it ca n ' t be the lack of facilities .
and with the general - cum - president , india has lots of business to talk .
in the charred remains of that fiery day in imphal lies a story of regional remoteness and national indifference .
given the voracious human appetite for land , even he knows achieving this would be nothing short of a miracle .
the plight of the wolves only symbolises the tragic fate of indian wildlife today .
at the dawn of independence , forests draped the country like an elegant green gown - covering more than half the land - nourishing and protecting wildlife .
these are people like jhala who battle - day in and day out - in the little swathes of forest that hold our wildlife .
but what are you doing to remove this , well , alienation ?
give the wretched more dollops and keep them happy .
that is the so - called economic package .
as per a special status under the constitution , the northeast gets 20 per cent of the total central assistance to the states .
what has it achieved ?
certainly not a scenario of development repudiating the gun .
rather , the situation there is one of less development and more underground guns .
and you cannot bring the northeast to the national mainstream by treating the regional crisis as a law and order problem .
emotional integration is the issue here .
that cannot be achieved at gun point , or by more economic packages .
reach out to them and redeem them from a corrupt political class .
make them feel at home , the name of which is india , india alone .
even while toning the triceps on the nautilus , it ' s labels all the way .
faux will do , sometimes they even outlast the original .
the idea is to look clean , sophisticated and understated , never mind the dubious antecedents of the outfit .
the beer glass is a nighttime accessory and if there ' s a cigar to complement it , you are the high priest of luckihood .
does n ' t matter if it ' s the same cohiba that you ' ve been flashing for two weeks .
labels : in a generation ravaged by couture anxiety , the label sets aside the lucki aristocracy from lucki commoners .
fashion street or fashion flash , ersatz offleads come cheap and easy .
the race for alexander mcqueen , michael kors , hussein chalayan , or yamamoto is still wide open .
spending : money talks and the luckies catwalk .
sometimes it does n ' t cost much to have money - just pretend you do .
the glint of gold is important to be taken more seriously by lucki peers .
motto : bank on creditworthy daddies .
compare a super stylish club in london and djinns .
you ' d probably find upstartish versace here and an avant garde yohji yamamoto there . "
but out of the emerging sophistication one thing is clear : the luckies dress to stand out .
the angst - ridden ' 70s socialism was in full swing , and the nehruvian hangover continued .
for the young , che guevera and amitabh bachchan were cool , and the dollar was exotic .
it was chic to be left , wear kurtas and sport angst as an unshaven commitment .
the first signs of nouveau riche spending began to show on the social horizon , and for the well - heeled youngster , owning a maruti was ambition .
the carefree ' 90s a teen in the 1990s was a teen forever - the world was suddenly at his doorstep .
" one day , " recalled dixit , " deen dayalji ' s leg hit the cycle wheel and it started bleeding .
but he did n ' t tell his friend and went to the rally despite his injury . "
it is also the sort of story that would appear fictional , given what the bjp ' s office bearers in uttar pradesh have been up to .
the party has been in power in lucknow for more than half the decade since 1991 .
the bjp has split the state into six regions , each to be looked after by an organising secretary .
currently , three incumbents run two regions apiece .
one organising secretary has such a colourful reputation that party circles refer to him as " daam pyare " ( rate friendly ) .
during the 1999 lok sabha election , the organising secretaries were , as is usual , the agency for giving money to candidates .
more than one bjp aspirant complained the sum promised never reached him in full .
one organising secretary went to the other extreme and asked candidates in each of the 13 constituencies he had been told to visit to reimburse his entire petrol bill .
there have also been accusations of sexual harassment against both organising secretaries and their subordinates , the divisional vibhagya mantris .
i refused and was constantly denied a party ticket . "
in 1999 , then state bjp acting president om prakash singh sought to take action against " contractors and criminals in the party " .
by coincidence or otherwise , singh soon lost his charge .
his successor , kalraj mishra , insists the " organising secretaries are working with full dedication and honesty " .
the fact is that the party edifice mishra presides over is riddled with holes .
they are our heroes of wildlife , though they hardly see themselves as such .
to them , success would come only if millions of other indians joined in their struggle .
driven by nothing but a deep concern that comes from within , they know that all they can look forward to is a continuous struggle , with no rewards .
this is their story .
the bjp ' s first dalit president says in his first major speech that he would like to see his party examine why muslims dislike the bjp .
he urges his party to stop ignoring the muslims simply because they do not vote for it .
" we have somehow taken it for granted that our party will not receive any significant support from them .
in an election year , that is half the battle lost .
for 400 years , it has stood as the symbol of hyderabad .
built by the qutubshahi dynasty , the charminar is an elegant symbiosis of hindu and muslim traditions .
" we are spending more on damage control than on protecting the monument , " admits dr s . v . p . halakatti , superintending archaeologist , asi .
the latest scar is on the southwest minaret .
it is a gaping eyesore that has made chief minister n . chandrababu naidu sit up and take notice .
he has put syed omar jaleel , former regional director in the hyderabad municipal administration , in charge of the pedestrianisation project .
the damage has come when the state is being promoted aggressively as a tourist destination .
the first warnings came as early as 1984 when the birla archaeological and cultural research institute , hyderabad , carried out an exhaustive study .
they recommend banning heavy vehicles in the vicinity and continuous monitoring of vehicular vibrations .
the authorities have been asked to create alternative traffic routes within 18 months .
as a first step , the asi has pushed back the protective iron railing around the charminar by five metres .
a rs 100 - crore road - widening project is on the anvil .
telephone and electric lines will now be laid below the ground .
" i told them , ' never cover up for me , ' " says the general .
even in the unrelenting environment of the army , musharraf always found ways to be the outsider .
he was known for his defiance and says , " people wonder how i made it to the top . "
yet , " i was always loved by my subordinates . i knew their problems , " he says .
" he is a reluctant coupmaker , " explains begum zarreen musharraf , the president ' s mother and loudest cheerleader .
" he would take me to task if i came home late .
what possessed him to overlook five generals and trust zia - ul haq to be his army chief ? "
he then went on to swear on the holy koran that he would always remain loyal and faithful .
bhutto ' s trust was amply repaid when zia ousted him in 1977 and then hanged him .
when vajpayee took the bus to lahore , few remembered it was nawaz sharif and his isi chief javed nasir who masterminded the mumbai blasts of 1993 .
this preconceived approach has not helped our party either .
we cannot afford to allow this situation to continue .
if we do so , we shall be hurting our own future prospects and the muslims will continue to be used as vote banks by our adversaries . "
so it is interesting that bangaru laxman ' s words seem to have had the opposite effect .
secular editors sneered , secular cartoonists lampooned bjp leaders and secular politicians huffed and puffed .
how dare you , was , oddly enough , the general reaction .
but indian muslims were choosy about the islamic law they wanted and we indulged them .
president pervez musharraf speaks of it in the same breath as kashmir .
he has even linked the return of the house to the re - opening of the indian consulate in karachi .
the house was dear to jinnah .
even after partition , he refused to accept compensation for the property and longed to return to it .
in a letter to the then prime minister jawaharlal nehru , jinnah had begged that the house not be demolished or sold .
in 1948 the house was leased to the british high commission .
originally named south court by jinnah , the house was renamed jinnah house by the consulate , which occupied it until 1982 .
the issue of leasing the house , which has been lying vacant ever since , has been periodically raised by pakistan .
( its consulate in mumbai was shut down in 1994 . )
but the issue is too hot a political brick for any party .
jinnah ' s only child dina wadia , too , has vehemently opposed pakistan ' s demand .
as early as 1982 , she had written to the government staking her claim to the building .
she also wrote to the then pakistan high commissioner in delhi , abdul sattar , asking islamabad to refrain from making any claim .
" but since it is a decision that has political implications , it has been put on hold , " says nusli .
local resident associations too have opposed its handover to pakistan and have threatened an agitation .
but until it takes a decision , the bats and snakes will continue to reign supreme over jinnah ' s legacy atop malabar hill .
phonetically , agra does n ' t rhyme with peace .
though peace in the subcontinental context has become more of an abstraction wrapped in emotion than a geopolitical expediency .
that is not because of the k - word , which is only a consequence of the overwhelming p - word .
pakistan is not .
it is an underdeveloped civil society gasping for air under the jackboot of military dictatorship .
the subcontinent has to come out this self - limiting historical ghetto the way europe is coming out of the memories of world war ii .
get real and let each other live .
and of course , peace can be a harmless mindset .
but jayalalitha ( that ' s the unofficial spelling ) is not a confused person .
she ' s a woman of mental clarity and administrative purposefulness .
qualities that were visible even on a rival television channel .
the steady stream of global agencies into india is guided by good economics and talent .
" you get to debate with the best minds and work six months ahead of the season .
kolkata - based lalit and sunita jalan have worked on japanese designer kenzo ' s personal wardrobe .
the net effect was only to make it possible for muslim men to have more than one wife and impossible for divorced muslim women to get alimony .
we spend taxpayers ' money to send muslims on haj without extending similar privileges to hindu pilgrims travelling , for instance , to manasarovar .
we have even banned books they disapproved of , banned salman rushdie from coming to india because they detested him .
but , most dangerously , we have closed our eyes to what has been going on in muslim educational institutions .
but so sacrosanct is secularism in india that we are now allowing the same thing to happen in uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh and even distant tamil nadu .
so when laxman talks about understanding muslim fears , we can only pray the bjp is not going to adopt nehruvian secularism .
in the process of making the muslims feel at home we have allowed our historians to lie blatantly about muslim rule in india .
" the giddha ' s beauty lies in its feminine motifs , " says nahar singh , a folk art researcher .
a team can comprise any number of dancers from 15 to 40 .
each dancer has a specific movement to make and carries a traditional musical instrument .
it could be a sap , a kaato , a garba or a bugdoo - all devices made by local artisans .
in 1970 , sat pal , a giddha enthusiast , took the initiative of converting the loose dance form into a stage performance .
but more than such efforts , it is the village elders who have helped preserve the tradition .
not content with performing the dance themselves , they have popularised the art outside the village .
sunil shetty , ajay devgan , arbaaz khan , abhishek bachchan , sanjay dutt , jackie shroff , saif ali khan and akshaye khanna will star .
there ' s even talk of a ninth - shah rukh khan .
dutta has reportedly asked his heroes to sport crew cuts and is believed to have said , " border was a trailer .
this will be bigger . "
question : will tiger hills boast nine heroines and 18 songs too ?
so there was no miracle in agra .
but president pervez musharraf is not alone in feeling " disappointed " and " hurt " by this historic let - down .
as if two days in the shadow of taj mahal should have undone 54 years of institutionalised hate and mistrust .
maybe it was because of the pre - summit mood of great expectations and overuse of the adjective " historic " .
something that should have ideally been a business - like affair was turned into a larger - than - reality occasion .
that is why the day after has become the day of subcontinental depression .
that is why a word like " failure " is being used to describe a one - dimensional reality .
and its post - summit conclusion ?
" the destination of a joint statement has not been reached . "
for the prosaic guest there was only one destination and it was kashmir .
agra was all about knowing each other .
now india has a clear idea of what the general wants .
also , he has shown to his countrymen what he is bargaining with india for on their behalf .
certainly an intelligent commando , musharraf , in his heart of hearts , must have known there would be no bilateral agreement on his destination .
the challenge is to make the best of a rather bad beginning .
the summit of eternal peace is an illusion , and india and pakistan have miles to ascend .
that is his existential expediency .
it ' s time india also talked kashmir - not to the general but to itself .
for india , unlike for the general , kashmir is not a dispute but a situation , a bad domestic situation .
hindus and muslims know islam is the very antithesis of hinduism but our political leaders have perpetrated the lie that all religions are the same .
if we confront the differences but ensure muslims have the same rights in india as hindus , we will begin to start solving the problem .
laxman needs to think carefully about what he would like to change .
he certainly needs to dissociate his party from organisations like the bajrang dal and to work towards giving more muslims bjp tickets at election time .
but he needs to stay as far away from congress - type secularism as possible .
true , there is an elected government in the state led by farooq abdullah whose administrative record is , to say the least , inadequate .
the so - called kashmiri alienation , to a great extent , cannot be attributed to a misplaced sense of nationalism .
most of the blame should be borne by the rulers of kashmir .
kashmir , like the northeast , is far away and has been given a special status .
which means more dollops but less political will to make a qualitative difference to the lives of the people .
no nation can afford to lose its people ' s hearts .
delhi seems to be overlooking this simple truth at a time when kashmir is part of the international glossary of flashpoints .
what is required are political confidence - building measures .
hence the over - visibility of the hurriyat , the national credibility of some of whose members is questionable .
kashmir should not be subordinated to india ' s problems with pakistan .
it should be treated as a domestic urgency .
it deserves liberation from political apathy .
many are the committees that such a venture necessitates , and the largesse is spread far and wide .
union sports minister uma bharati in her magnanimity has appointed her housekeeper rani singh to three committees .
her personal media manager begraj khatan is vice - chairperson of a panel .
apparently the state is dragging its feet as former union finance minister manmohan singh feels a probe would discourage foreign direct investment .
koolwal says marandi failed to confirm his participation despite several requests to do so .
he ' s moved the central administrative tribunal for a posting to jaipur .
and he ' s made sinha a party to the petition .
at dusk , groups of policemen descend on hamlets and announce that there will be a film screening .
some sequences from mgr movies later there pops up the edited police video footage of the karunanidhi arrest .
" see the truth , " the policemen say .
meanwhile , we are forced to watch in horror " freedom fighters " kill innocent villagers and pilgrims .
despite our attempts to prove their direct involvement we have failed so far .
worse , perhaps , since he heads the government of a country that is not yet considered a rogue state .
having said this though , it is hard to absolve our own government of blame for the terrible violence in kashmir .
our security forces often behave no better than terrorists and do enormous damage to india ' s image and their own .
in an incident that happened while the agra summit was in progress they killed a nine - year - old schoolgirl .
equally inexplicable was the congress demand for a judicial inquiry into the recent massacre of hindu pilgrims in kashmir .
does the congress believe , as pakistan does , that it was indian soldiers and not muslim militants who were responsible ?
reviewing former foreign secretary j . n . dixit ' s recent book on afghanistan in india today last week , arabist manvendra singh made an astonishing claim .
there is , he wrote , " an interest across the strata of society , from barmer to bromley , to understand " afghanistan .
the evidence of rising unfamiliarity and disinterest in our neighbourhood is overwhelming .
take the worthwhile studies on contemporary afghanistan in recent years .
a samajwadi party leader wants home minister l . k . advani to resign for failing to protect her .
equally responsible , says the same leader , is uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh , who had denied phoolan z - plus security cover .
this instant judgement is political irresponsibility .
and the judgement brings out a larger truth , though an unpleasant one . it is about the state and the overprotected politician .
phoolan devi , mp , signified both the triumph and tragedy of indian democracy .
yet , can electoral power legitimise criminalised politics , and is it the state ' s moral responsibility to provide lifetime security to every politician with a criminal record ?
certainly not .
but it is the state ' s responsibility to find her killers .
as a bandit , phoolan had her own code of punishment .
the state does n ' t have to emulate her to bring posthumous justice to her .
shaikh ' s five acre farm is in the heart of mumbai - boxed in between the railway tracks connecting the busy parel and dadar stations .
unmindful of the crammed suburban trains hurtling past , his hired hands diligently work the rectangular patch .
welcome to the " grow more food " campaign of central railways , mumbai .
of course , it is not a millennium project .
" the scheme itself is very old , ' ' says central railway spokesperson mukul marwah .
in the mid - 1960s government departments like the railways were urged to grow food on surplus land to usher in the green revolution .
the revolution did indeed happen and the schemes were then forgotten .
another problem crept in .
in mumbai the unmanageable immigrant influx and high pressure on scarce land threatened the railways ' real estate .
the encroachers were evicted from the safety zone after a series of high court judgements .
the railways had to think of a way of keeping their property free of encroachers .
it ' s a win - win situation : the city offers a ready market for fresh vegetables and the land is put to good use .
vegetables now grow on 260 acres of vacant land leased out to 187 railway staffers .
rubble is being bulldozed to retrieve more land for farming .
the railways has set itself a target of bringing more than 150 acres of land under cultivation in the next few months .
once the agreement is decided on , every other expense - fertilisers , water supply and labour - is borne by the lessee .
the railroad farms also provides others with employment .
shaikh , for instance , hires six labourers for rs 1,000 a month to tend the fields in his absence .
they stay in makeshift cottages near the fields guarding the produce from urchins and commuters alike .
they pump in water from nearby dadar station to irrigate the fields .
shaikh ' s only grouse is that the middlemen make a bigger profit selling his vegetables in the market .
the beat of city life does n ' t pause long enough to allow him the time .
yet , amid the concrete piles , he and the city are glad for the little added oxygen , the slight strips of green .
during the 1999 border war it was the eye of the storm .
last week , the change was evident .
the residents were busy refurbishing underground bunkers .
the caution was understandable .
the attack in sheshnag left 13 dead but reports now indicate that some of them may have been accidentally killed by security forces when they returned the fire .
the militants remained undeterred .
the next day in the jammu sector , they killed 19 people , including 15 hindu residents , women and children in doda .
in the following days in sporadic explosions in srinagar , kupwara and bandipora , explosions left two dead and several injured .
even in the siachen sector , pakistan stepped up artillery firing in the world ' s highest battlefield .
security forces are expecting more .
official sources say that infiltration continues unabated in uri , gurez and keran sectors where the srinagar - based 15 corps are in charge of security .
the situation is pretty much the same in poonch and rajouri sectors of the nagrota - based 16 corps .
the indian army ' s assessment is that pakistan will keep the loc active through infiltration and artillery firing .
the objective is to keep the loc simmering without escalating the artillery duels .
within the empire , india played an autonomous role .
the isolationism was egged on by a fortress india economic policy that led to civil society breaking off age - old links with the neighbourhood .
the end result : zero presence in afghanistan , nominal influence in iran and a tibet policy that serves china better than india .
we demand a place in the un security council , but are we equipped to undertake the obligations ?
at the olympic games the indian sees himself , with sudden , frightening clarity , in relation to a vast , unfathomable sporting universe .

" the cease - fire is in force in nagaland until july 31 next year , " says home ministry spokesman p . d . shenoy .
officials feel the nscn has issued statements only to keep up the morale of its cadre .
the government ' s confidence stems from the fact that people of nagaland want peace .
if the nscn returns to violence it will not enjoy any public support .
the powerful nagaland baptist church council and the naga hoho , the apex council of naga tribes , have said they are committed to peace .
the conclave will not take place .
the visiting pakistan president , who charmed the indian media with his style , is probably not a trivia buff either .
thiruvananthapuram : the imperious kerala assembly speaker vakkom purushothaman likes to be known as a stickler for rules .

in mumbai , kalpana desai , director of the prince of wales museum , says , " our annual budget is roughly rs 2 crore .
after salaries and establishment costs , we have to beg , borrow and scout for sponsors for every little maintenance job or for any big project . "
no one here would say : ' hey , if we have nothing to do , let ' s go to the museum ' .
shyamal kanti chakravarti , director of the indian museum , kolkata , seems to have caught the drift .
" till now no one thought of the museum as a service provider , " he says .
chakravarti also knows that to become a public recreational and educational utility , his museum will have to compete with films and football .
the result was for all to see .
hopefully , with major projects like the showing of the nizam ' s jewels and the picasso exhibition on the anvil , things will finally change for the better .
in a country as diverse and treacherously complex as india , leadership has many different attributes and follows different idioms .
rooted in kinship , he imparted clout to rural populism .
after the mahatma , jayaprakash narayan came to symbolise saintliness .
yet , there was another idiom of leadership that india looked up to , an idiom that never passed the test of squeamish respectability .
so during the april 2001 panchayat elections he assured the terror - struck villagers : " aap ghabraiye mat .
there will be no dearth of bullets ) . "
so he spouts media - hogging one - liners that get instant attention and filter down the official hierarchy with ease .
the figures may be right but not many are convinced .
convincing may take a while , but if prasad ' s tactics succeed , he may yet have the last laugh .

even the local imams have started stressing on a dress code .
" it is a serious matter , " agrees girja dhar , chairperson of the state women ' s commission .
" the only silver lining is that all major militant groups have condemned the attack . "
indeed , prominent militant groups have dissociated themselves from the dress code campaign .
no wonder in his two years in the ministry , his heart has never been in the job .
from airlines to airports and the hotels runs by his ministry , the changes during his tenures have mostly been for the worse .
last year ia reported losses of around rs 177 crore after three profitable years .
no private investment in any metro airport has taken place despite opening up of airports to private investment - indian and foreign - last year .
a new civil aviation policy is being drafted for the past six years .
all that adds up to quite a report card for a minister .
the rest is lost in the intricate and elaborate maze of leakages .
he , in fact , adds to that .
more than two lakh villages in india have no access to safe water and roads .
about 90 per cent of rural households do n ' t have sanitation facilities .
" after 53 years of independence , is this an achievement to be proud of ? " he asks incredulously .

but naidu is just 10 months old in this ministry - rather in any ministry .
he has chalked out a three - pronged strategy to " change the face of rural india " .
naidu proposes to put up signboards in every village detailing local development schemes .
by making people aware of what they are entitled to , naidu hopes to put pressure on state governments .
despite having committed to delegation to panchayats in 1993 , most state governments have n ' t actually done much .
naidu has now committed states to complete the process by march 2002 , failing which 20 per cent of their allotted funds will be held back .
he is betting on development through women ' s empowerment and proposes to set up 14 lakh women ' s self - help groups by 2004 .
he also wants corporate firms to pick up the tab .
" india has about six lakh companies and five lakh villages .
but it ' s the law ministry where jaitley will be put to the toughest trial .
he has set an ambitious agenda for himself for 2001 .
but the most daunting target is the proposed amendments to the civil procedure code ( cpc ) that will drastically slash the legal backlog .
a civil case takes 5 - 10 years to arrive at a verdict in the high courts .
the amended cpc will bring down the average time to one year .
he has simply fixed deadlines for each process in a civil case .
for instance , at present up to six months are wasted in delivery of summons because they are sent only through registered post .
the amended law will allow summons to be sent through fax , e - mail or courier , thus cutting the time to 30 days maximum .

indian language schools are , without exception , provincial , outdated and out of touch with modern methods of education .
this is why even politicians like mulayam singh yadav , who believe passionately in the hindi cause , end up sending their own children to english - medium schools .
this is why children of our bureaucrats and politicians end up being taught in english .
this is why even ordinary villagers seek english - medium schools for their children .
this should be a matter of grave concern to a human resource development minister who belongs to a political party that considers itself the sentinel of indian national pride .

last week the gujarat high court thwarted a bid by builders to construct residential buildings on gopalnagar lake near kalol , 30 km from ahmedabad .
says lalsinh raol , an ahmedabad - based ornithologist : " it is a landmark judgement that will go a long way in saving wetlands . "
the 2.5 sq km lake is home to a large number of migratory species .
it has ruled that the revised plans should undergo the scrutiny of gwab , which has to report on the gopalnagar case to the court within two months .
ahmedabad had 125 - odd lakes 40 years ago , of which only 12 remain .
but uttaranchal chief minister nityanand swami is cast in a different mould .
in fact , i still consult him before taking any major decision " .
nearly 30 years ago , he failed to win an assembly election on a jan sangh ticket .
so he decided to try his luck with the congress .
swami , who till then used to cycle daily to attend the rss shakhas , promptly joined the congress bandwagon .
years later , he returned to the bjp to seek its support for his candidacy as legislative council chairman .
if swami had not become chief minister , perhaps no one would even have known that he was not a local , but a haryanvi from mahendragarh district .
when the agitation for uttaranchal was at its peak , swami was never around .
so when his name cropped up for chief ministership his critics began to questions his commitment to uttaranchal .
there are almost a dozen aides assisting him in day - to - day work .
one is an architect , some others are rss full - timers .
one of his osds , to whom the chief minister is said to be very close to , is his own son - in - law sunil harivyasi .
swami has the perfect defence : " an osd should be a person in whom one can confide .
he should know what you like to eat and what you like to wear .
who can know it better than my son - in - law ? "
the reason offered for his sudden illness was excessive heat due to " malfunctioning of air conditioners " .
that ' s a charitable view .
for most of his party colleagues who have been baying for his blood suggest the malfunctioning is cerebral .
" he is old and inefficient , " says a senior minister .
" it ' s a directionless and confused government led by an inexperienced chief minister , " says suryakant dhasmana of congress .
swami may refute the charge that he is directionless but even his aides admit that he often presents a picture of confusion .
he is known to blindly sign files put before him without raising even a single query .
as for targets to be achieved , here are swami ' s priorities : construct a stadium and community centres , upgrade some degree colleges .
the two other parties - sp and bahujan samaj party - have limited presence in the new state .
" he is still our best bet and we are not going to replace him , " says bjp general secretary p . l . khandelwal .

for swami , the compromise chief minister , it is better it stays that way .

says ravi nair of the south asian human rights documentation centre : " an international scrutiny of human rights in the country is essential .
the un scrutiny will ensure programme funding of the issue . "
nair is supported by congress mp from gujarat pravin rashtraphal .
but then why should a lok sabha member seek help from an international agency for problems he can solve with the right political leadership ?
political work is a daunting task .
more than that such work is virtually passe in states like maharashtra and gujarat that once witnessed militant dalit movement .
rashtraphal admits he relies on the ngo network for political support .
the former revenue officer himself runs an ngo - council for social justice .
today , ngos are a springboard for politics much as labour unions once were .
however , not everyone is convinced about the government ' s objections to the raising of the caste issue in durban .

when asked to lead a battle against shivaji , khan contacted astrologers who predicted doom - death at the hands of the maratha soldiers .
fearing that his wives would remarry after his death , the anxious general chose to kill them .

the events of september 11 have lent a dramatic urgency to the establishment of such a partnership .

the terrible spectacle of americanism was there in the towering flames , only for the eyes of the living .
at the moment though every anti - americanist is not reading clancy or watching arnie .
he is misreading the scriptures to understand the geomancy of his empire .
or , he is leafing through the antique work of revolution for a slogan against the imperialist .
that is , ultimate horror for the civilised world , as it was in new york and washington .
the funny thing , though , is anti - americanism has lost the war in civil society long ago .
it ' s prophet versus pizza hut .
however , none of the scenarios had visualised the horrendous terrorist attacks on september 11 .
but irrational and fanatical minds think alike .
mumbai in march 1993 was the seed from which new york 2001 was born .
catastrophic terrorist groups , like the al qaida of osama bin laden , do not use modern technologies .
like the cia , the indian intelligence community has also been strong in techint , but weak in humint .
other countries adopted it many years ago , but we have only recently woken up to the need for it .
terrorist networks are fast shedding their dependence on the state - sponsors .

in a healthy knee , the thigh and shin bones rest comfortably cushioned on either side of a semi - hard substance called cartilage .
cartilage is smooth so the bones effortlessly glide over it when we move .
a liquid called synovial fluid further acts as a lubricant on the joint .
smooth cartilage is crucial for movement .
in osteoarthritis , the cartilage is damaged and gets rough .
little wonder , of late vajpayee has found it difficult to speak standing up .
according to dr a . rajagopal , a leading orthopaedic , osteoarthritis is a common age - related degenerative disease .
several factors can trigger the disease : genetic disorders , knee injuries , fractures , obesity , gout or other arthritic conditions .
" obesity , " stresses rajagopal , " is a major factor . "

q . do you think that by claiming to become a frontline state for war gainst terrorism pakistan will have leverage in the future of afghanistan ?
however , it failed .
the earthquake apart , gujarat was yet to recover from the effects of the kandla cyclone and two successive droughts .
it is these issues that modi will have to address in right earnest .
a diligent rss soldier , modi ' s ability to deliver ( see box ) is what the bjp is banking on .
it was during this period that the party was put on the political map at the grassroots level in gujarat .
" under modi , the bjp is once again charged to take on the congress , " says jayendrasinh vaghela , a party worker .
artificial knees are said to last up to 20 years .
and three , there might be some kind of penal action against apollo , which the health ministry is still conjuring up .
he was kept there for nine days and a series of tests conducted .
much of the trilogy has moments which are the stuff of cinema .
these were journeys without a map or a passport .
or like the encounter with a taliban squad that could have been fatal .
" the taliban court gave its verdict .
i was to be shot dead on the morning of july 22 , 1995 , on the charge of disorderly behaviour unbecoming of a woman . . .
filmmakers are now queueing up at bandopadhyay ' s flat in the city ' s eastern suburbs .
pakhtoon groups in india feel the film might trigger racial conflicts .
i will not let my stories be filmed if this line gets blurred by the omission or commission of the filmmakers . "
last week , the production company flew her to ladakh so that she could watch the shooting , examine the script and decide on the film ' s fate .
bandopadhyay and khan live in a city far from ground zero of the western powers ' war on islamic terrorism .
she has embarked on her new project , a weekly bangla magazine focusing on women ' s rights .
the pashtoon factor came into play around the same time .
it was the 1991 gulf war which laid the basis for the taliban phenomenon .
it is in this broader context that the american bombing of afghanistan coincided with the radical reshuffle in the military high command on october 7 .
two four - star generals were promoted , a new head of the isi appointed and a number of the corps commanders changed .
musharraf ' s closest confidantes , former isi chief lt - general mahmood ahmed and deputy chief of army staff lt - general muzaffar hussain usmani , have retired .
he , it is learnt , insisted on being treated for it , even though there were no symptoms .
this mention of uncooperativeness , experts feel , will definitely help apollo in its defence .
it can resort to the plea that had he come back with the same symptoms , a bone marrow test would definitely have been done .
that brings us to the action that is being contemplated against apollo by the health ministry .
dr thakur has gone on national television harping on the mis - diagnosis and the indictment of apollo .
the delhi government , on the basis of the report , can move to cancel apollo ' s licence .
however , that may turn out to be a long legal wrangle , since apollo is sure to take them to court .
what will happen in the end is still unclear .
but the report itself has brought no joy to the kumaramangalam family .
says kitty kurmaramangalam , the minister ' s wife : " he has gone and left us with this burning fire . "
yet , the wheels of justice must move rapidly so that the accused , if found guilty , are punished .
we know this but between the prime minister and bill gates we were reminded last week just how humiliatingly third world we are .
if vajpayee ' s visit was a success it was more to do with what his hosts had to say than anything he did .
but then that must be the difference between first world speechwriters and third world ones .
let ' s acknowledge it : there is much that distinguishes first from third but , perhaps , the most important distinctions come under the category of infrastructure .
batohi led the evidence for the king commission .
it was the first major public inquiry into match - fixing , one which undertook the painful business of interrogating the biggest names in south african cricket .
batohi ' s business in delhi was an extension of her duties with the commission but all she said was , " the discussions have been positive .
there are difficulties but we hope to sort them out . "
batohi also raised questions about the legalities involved in tapping cronje ' s phone .
along with these requests , batohi wanted a meeting fixed with bookie rajesh kalra , a co - accused in the case .
but things were n ' t easy for her or captain geoff edwards , her colleague on the king commission , as indian investigators too tried to play tough .
they can have them once we file them in court .
also , batohi did not have a letter rogatory ( lr ) , a legal requirement , to press her requests .
for its part , the delhi police told the south africans that cronje ' s conversations were legally taped .
permission was taken to monitor the cell phone and the tapping began with the interception of threatening calls received by a delhi businessman .
" soon , from the underworld we were on to the world of match - fixers , " adds sharma .
in any case , the phone provided to cronje by chawla was purchased in kalra ' s name .
the idea was to transform gandhinagar from a chaotic mix of farmland and forests to a place befitting a state capital .
many of these sales have been in gross violation of allotment rules .
among those accused of making money out of government largesse are chief minister keshubhai patel and leader of the opposition amarsinh chaudhary of the congress .
on keshubhai ' s 330 sq m plot stands a six - apartment complex called arihant palace .
keshubhai owns one apartment , another houses a beauty parlour while yet another is up for sale .
the price : rs 6.5 lakh .
keshubhai was n ' t available for comment but a spokesman said that the chief minister had not violated any rules .
when chaudhary was allotted a 300 sq m plot in the early 1970s , sector 1 was not a very posh location .
it is not difficult to fathom why lawmakers are behaving like petty wheeler - dealers .
at rs 300 a sq m , a plot measuring 330 sq m cost just rs 1 lakh .
but in the open market that plot is now worth almost rs 15 lakh .
few exceptions : even those in charge of checking such irregularities have fallen prey to greed .
construction work is about to begin on the plots allotted to gujarat ' s minister of state for urban development parmanand khattar and former bjp mp haribhai patel .
similarly , an apartment complex is coming up on the plot belonging to congress leader and former state finance minister babubhai meghji shah .
there are those , however , who have chosen to swim against the tide .
since the issue involves big names , officials are not willing to speak on the irregularities .
gandhinagar ' s cupboards are full of such skeletons .
secondly , every new government showers a largesse of land with an eye on its vote bank .
if a municipal body is set up , politicians will not be able to manipulate land allotments .
but so long as lawmakers resist change , gandhinagar will continue its descent into urban chaos .
that ' s many decibels below her shrill cry for president ' s rule a few weeks back .
however , this temporary lull is not to be mistaken for peace .
with the stated objective of reclaiming alienated vote banks , kesri called his own ascent a resurgence of the backward classes within the congress .
to further his cause , he turned against the man who made it possible for him to become party president .
he humiliated p . v . narasimha rao out of the office of chairman of the congress party in parliament .
that made him a soft target for sonia loyalists who had by then swelled the congress ranks .
in between he ventured to conduct party polls and faced a challenge from younger leaders such as sharad pawar and rajesh pilot .
though he secured a convincing victory , the downward march had begun .
the sonia brigade did n ' t have to try much to author an unceremonious kesri exit .
they used the results for another leadership change .
sonia brought him back to the congress working committee as a special invitee .
his successor ' s inability to bring the party to power led many congress leaders to cry over his shoulders .
when his house became a centre of activity , sonia grew suspicious and denied him a rajya sabha nomination early this year .
the atal bihari vajpayee government allowed him to retain the bungalow as a freedom fighter and redeemed his honour .
the irony was overwhelming : it took a bjp government to rehabilitate the senior leader of india ' s gop .
the union is incensed by two new features in the incentive package linked to the " external environment " .

india is hoping that bush will lift the economic sanctions imposed by the us after the 1998 tests .
but he would want an improvement in indo - pakistan relations as a pre - condition .

richard celeste , us ambassador to india , told india today : " we are on the threshold of a mature , long - term relationship .

the public - sector ddt monopoly collapsed because of its inadequacy to cope with the resistance .
its future private sector managers may have a better luck .
not entirely because the name mekong , according to some interpretations , is a linguistic variation of ma ganga .
it ' s about making the east a vital part of indian foreign policy .
today , india as a dialogue partner no longer treats the asean as a club of marginal influence .
india has acquired the confidence to assert its legitimate asian role , and it ' s ready to reach out .
the west , the natural ally , has already taken note , and the east , the civilisational ally , cannot ignore .
vahini could not tell them that she was pregnant when they injected potent snake venom into her .
barely a month later , the mare gave birth to a young one with a suspected limb disorder .
soon after the delivery , vahini went blind in the right eye and her left eye was partially damaged .
vahini is a living victim of man ' s age - old argument that ends justify the means .
asvs is produced by first injecting snake venom into horses and then extracting their blood .
the antibodies produced by the animal after the injection of the venom are used to make the serum .
not any longer though .
the tragic consequences of the overdose administered to vahini have shaken up the institute .
earlier this month , the tamil nadu government ordered the suspension of asvs production at the institute for two months .
at 100 , the king is ailing .
and so are most of the 140 - odd animals - horses and mules - housed there for experiments and production of serum .

basu ' s abiding presence in the state ' s political landscape is welcome to his bete noire , trinamool congress supremo mamata banerjee .
" bengal is being run by two chief ministers , " she gleefully says .
the state congress is even planning to file a public - interest petition on the matter .
while that ' s too speculative , basu , by casting a long shadow on the left front government , has put his successor in a dialectical muddle .
this is not the first time nepalese citizens have reacted with outrage over an apparent insult .
this completely innocuous remark was interpreted as an example of indian expansionism .
that a tiny country may be occasionally highly strung when encountering a gigantic neighbour is to be expected .
unfortunately , there is reason to believe that the public demonstrations in nepal are not just innocent if misplaced anger .
the agency that is busy playing nero is the government of nepal .
so if pakistan does a pearl harbour on india , it can cripple the indian economy in one fell swoop .
the armed forces are livid that such vital strategic assets , particularly the two titanic petrochemical complexes were set up here .
after all , the final responsibility for defending these assets lies with us , says a senior naval official .
the strategic importance of this region should have been considered before making such huge investments .
but the armed forces fear that the tables could easily turn in a future conflict .
were playing a high risk game , warns a senior naval official .
an example of such harmony is the indus river water sharing accord of 1960 which has survived three wars between the two neighbours .
but experience says that with pakistan , it is better to be safe than sorry .
hill stations , beach resorts , wildlife sanctuaries , heritage sites - she ' s been there , seen it all .
and never got tired of it .
what started as an experiment is now a " must - have " holiday for her .
the idea of sailing in a luxurious moving city and seeing new lands has caught the imagination of many indians .
as a senior executive from the cruising industry puts it , " the desis have finally been hooked . "
but even on ayodhya , there is only a small 20 per cent support for unilaterally constructing a ram temple on the disputed site .
this feeling is strongest among the illiterate .
the flip side is the 5 per cent who want a mosque rebuilt .
an overwhelming 56 per cent , however , endorse the vajpayee formula of either a negotiated settlement or a judicial verdict .
among muslims , support for these two options is as high as 62 per cent .
more important , only some 14 per cent identify ayodhya as the most important issue before the vajpayee government .
vajpayee , like p . v . narasimha rao before him , knows this too .
which is why he has chosen to outflank ram with another winner , lakshmi .
that , in a sense , is the central message of this poll .
having tasted political stability , the voters are now crying out for performance that reflect on their daily lives .
nor does sentimentalism carry the day .
jyoti basu does n ' t prevail in west bengal and vajpayee is only a whisker away from being worsted by sonia in uttar pradesh .
dravidian nationalism comes to vajpayee ' s help in tamil nadu and family past is no barrier to sonia in punjab .
stability , it would seem , has its charms .
it gives people the space to reflect , experiment and mature .
this poll is a pointer that in the coming days indian politics may well become more demanding by becoming less turbulent .
it is difficult work but is finally getting underway .

to students of history , sanjan , a small town on the banks of the varli river in south gujarat , is quite familiar .
this , they will tell you , is where the parsis first landed in india after fleeing from muslim invaders in iran .
barely a kilometre away at bhilwadi is a deep green mango tree , much less known , but equally old .
its knotted , bow - like trunk and drooping branches , unlike the crumbling ramparts of the fort , have stood the test of time .
it seemed she had ended the ambiguity about her faith on the banks of a river most sacred to hindus .
she then went to receive the blessings of the party ' s very own shankaracharya swami swaroopanand of dwarka peeth , an unrelenting foe of the bjp and vhp .
the mahakumbha cannot be a monopoly of the vhp , asserted spokesman anand sharma .
it will halt the alienation of hindus from the congress . "
sonia ' s mahakumbha journey is in a way a triumph of his line .
last april he was dropped from the congress working committee for suggesting the party rethink the basis of its secularism and socialism .
on january 12 , 1999 , she declared india was primarily secular because of hinduism .
two days later the cwc passed a resolution endorsing her viewpoint .
" the dip is aimed at drowning the propaganda against sonia ' s foreign origins , " says a senior party functionary .
" it ' s a feel good factor for party workers .
abstract secularism and anti - hindu stands do n ' t work in rural areas . "
in a letter , gadgil urged sonia to crown her mahakumbha dip with a reiteration of her january 1999 statement .
" if pluralism is the source of secularism then hinduism is nothing but pluralism .
the party must emphasise it . "
if the dip has put the caste hindu leaders in the party on overdrive , it has created disquiet among muslim leaders .
they also feel it would give a handle to rivals like the samajwadi party in uttar pradesh to wean away the community .
his worry is the leaders who are pushing for soft hindutva may now push harder to take more steps to placate hindus .
" next they will ask her to visit somnath .
on record muslim leaders are stoic and project sonia ' s dip as an act of faith .
former upcc president salman khurshid says , " muslims have taken it in their stride .
sonia visited ali mia at nadwa .
her sangam trip is personal . "
he recalls both jawaharlal nehru and indira gandhi visited the kumbha when they were prime minister .
" allahabad is after all home to them . "
gone is the secular belligerence that marked the atmosphere during december ' s furore over ayodhya .
says party secretary mani shankar aiyar , a self - confessed " secular fundamentalist " : " the mahakumbha is a cultural event .
to be secular one does n ' t have to be anti - hindu . "
seven years ago , on september 30 , 1993 , his village was the epicentre of a 6.4 tremblor .
the quake flattened 52 villages in the two districts of latur and osmanabad .
when the dust had settled in the pre - dawn mayhem , nearly 10,000 people lay dead and 16,000 injured .
killari , with a population of over 20,000 , was completely destroyed and over 1,400 persons killed .
legade ' s wife and two sons were among the dead .
those few seconds brought down all four houses and killed her .
beneficiary of the four - year rs 1,800 - crore maharashtra emergency earthquake rehabilitation programme , killari now boasts of nearly 3,000 concrete houses .
the neat single - storey houses stick in of the brown landscape .
but such efforts have not been able to help people like legade overcome their trauma .
legade - who has since remarried and has two children - lives in a tin shed near his concrete house .
legade now suffers from insomnia and anxiety .
" what is the solution to all this ? " he asks .
the spanking new government - built concrete houses have an eerie resemblance to potemkin villages .
for what catches the eye are the corrugated tin sheds built by the villagers adjoining nearly all these 3,000 houses .
the floors and ceilings are poorly finished .
in other houses , huge cracks have begun snaking through the walls .
the reason ?
so instead of dying a daily death , 50 - year - old rao put a noose around his neck and hanged himself on january 2 .
he was eventually compelled to sell it at rock - bottom prices after waiting for almost a week at the mandi for buyers and government agents .
indeed , wheat farmers are also faced with an impending glut .
from rs 8,680 per hectare in 1996 - 97 , the profit margin in wheat cultivation dwindled to rs 6,926 in 1998 - 99 .
in paddy , the farmer ' s earning of rs 7,640 per hectare in 1994 - 95 declined to rs 7,126 in 1996 - 97 .
simply put , while the minimum support price for wheat has grown eight times since 1971 , the cost of production has increased 15 - fold .
besides , there are still restrictions on the movement of foodgrains from one state to another , which prevent farmers from getting the best price for their crop .
experts feel the crisis is an opportune time for drastic steps .
for one , the stranglehold of the government , which today controls power , water , fertiliser , seeds , wages and trade of agriculture , must be loosened .
then , as joshi suggests , a common national market must be developed for foodgrains .
pockets of madhya pradesh , orissa , gujarat and rajasthan are already reeling under drought conditions .
the region accounts for more than 25 per cent of the total potato produced in the country .
potato farmers store the potato in cold storages for about rs 80 per quintal , taking it out and selling it before the arrival of the new crop .
but the bumper potato crop this year has queered the pitch .
but sen was asked to stay back and dayal given a surprising extension .
but mea officials defend the decision saying it was not an unusual posting .
this , in turn , has the potential of jeopardising political stability after the state assembly elections in april .
what should worry the government is the inability of the cease - fire to improve the situation on the ground .
the gains from the relative peace along the line of control have been offset by widespread civil disturbances in srinagar .
equally disturbing is the conflicting signals from delhi which have thrown the entire decision - making process into disarray .
it is not clear whether the pacification of kashmir is part of a domestic initiative or an aspect of wider international diplomacy .
hardly the best way to approach a problem of this magnitude .
the enemy never sleeps for the culturally paranoid .
he loathed dange ' s pro - congress policy , particularly after the emergency , but never challenged it outside the party forum .
in his personal life too , he was a stickler for decency .
he married , at 62 , suraiya , the woman he had loved for many years .
after joining politics he accepted the official code of conduct of the communist party ( which president narayanan calls gandhian ) from which he never deviated .
during his ministerial days , he never allowed the official car to enter the airport tarmac for him after a flight .
instead he ' d take the airline coach .
what happened to them ?
apparently , it was climatic changes or natural calamities that compelled aharites to quit farming which might not have remained remunerative in that area .

secondly , even the 9.5 rate of return is n ' t too bad if one considers that it is tax free .
also it is n ' t that there are no avenues which offer similar or better tax - free returns .
the government ' s move to align these rates with the cost of living will bring down interest rates across the board .
already the reserve bank of india has slashed the bank rate ( the rate at which it lends to banks ) to 7 per cent .
but that will be temporary .
it is the kind of politics that puts the interests of some pathetic political party or leader over the interests of india .
meanwhile , there has been more than enough money for the government to indulge in hopelessly loss - making entrepreneurial activities .
this was n ' t the first instance of the uk being used as a safe haven by terrorists .
omar sheikh , one of the three militants freed to secure the release of the hijacked indian airlines passengers in kandahar , was also a british citizen .
the new enactment , however , broadens its scope and prohibits the use of british soil for indulging in terrorism outside its geographical confines .
besides , it also bans the practice of any religious activity that incites violence .
but that was only part of the story .
an entire generation has been assured that 1971 will be avenged .
that was not the way the war inquiry commission - - appointed by zulfiqar ali bhutto , then president of pakistan , in december 1971 - - saw it .
it recommended a string of court - martials and trials against top officers .
nothing ever happened .
judging by the complaints emanating from some of his ministers he would be doing his own government a huge favour .
the other objective of the amendment is to bring under the tax net the signing - on payments prior to appointment , common to jobs with multinational companies .
over the past three months , the bear operators had been looking for an opportunity to snarl the herd of bulls led by ketan parekh .
every trick from persistent rumours about his arrest to defaults with supporting banks were tried out .
the timing did n ' t seem to work .
the idea was simple .
the bear plan was to hammer stocks and force bulls to fork out money to keep prices afloat .
in the bargain , at every fall , the bears earned a bonus out of short sales .
the rumours too helped the bears , hammering down the benchmark and adding to the pressure .
but what most congress leaders fear is that the departure of 12 partymen will open the doors to more dissidents .
" we need to close ranks against the left front , " mamata said the day the congressmen joined her party .
" let ' s do it now or we ' ll never get the chance again . "
as a welcome gift , she threw in tickets for eight of the nine mlas .
suddenly , 294 seats do n ' t seem enough to accommodate long - time loyalists , partner bjp and the new entrants .
while mamata set aside 39 seats for the bjp , new allies kamtapuri people ' s party got six seats and the jmm ( s ) wangled eight .
with just eight weeks to go for the polls , many of mamata ' s aides have discovered they will not get tickets .
this has led to acrimony within the party .
what irks mamata ' s acolytes is that in a make - or - break election she may be sticking her neck out for unworthy candidates .
in the 1996 assembly polls all but one scraped through with razor - thin leads .
sure - fire winners among them are few .
but they do bring along thousands of grassroots workers .
" if there are any more defections from the congress , " says a trinamool leader , " the nomination list will explode . "

q . but how would you explain major - generals taking money ?
now lets face it , we have a tried and tested method for defence procurement .
at the entry point itself you have to prove your product ' s worth .
however , to say that the whole system is rotten and porous is rubbish .
q . the other allegation is that your house is being misused by your party members including jaya jaitley .
my house does n ' t even have a gate .
i have never accepted security in my life .

the samata party has its office here and all kinds of people come and go .
a . she did not take any money .
the camera does n ' t show it .
and in fact she is quoted as saying that if there was any injustice done to anybody such people could approach us .
as far as i know she has never done it .
q . how would you describe your relationship with jaitley ?
a . she is a party colleague and was party president till recently .
q . has n ' t your departure damaged the atal bihari vajpayee government ?
a . on the contrary the government will emerge from this crucible of fire even stronger .
q . so will you continue to be the perennial rebel ?
a . that is a tag that is n ' t true .
i have always fought against injustice in all its forms and i will continue to do so .
he knew that change was desperately required and yet he did nothing at all to change anything .
anybody who believes that it is only the defence deals in which this sort of thing happens is sadly mistaken .
every government department functions only when it is well oiled with the grease of corruption .
naturally , there are some ministries in which it is possible to make more money than in others .
but it is possible to make quite a lot of money even in a humble ministry like health and family welfare if you know how .
could vajpayee have changed things ?
not that george has been personally compromised by a suitcase .

singh argued that the pmo had no hand in it .
the facts are somewhat different .
it was on the recommendation of this group operating within the pmo that the recast trai gave the green signal to wll use .

since then he and ahluwalia have become a permanent target of criticism for the inner core of the sangh parivar , notably the swadeshi jagran manch .
the duo was accused , among other things , of cosying up to mncs .
ahluwalia then got shunted out of the finance ministry to the nondescript planning commission .
but singh was too high for the sangh ' s reach .
at the beginning of november 1984 , george had declared assets of rs 1.56 lakh .
this was rs 9.61 lakh more than what he said he saved .
after december 1990 , george started drawing a monthly salary of rs 5,000 from the aicc .
suddenly , gift cheques began pouring into his various bank accounts in delhi .
between november 1991 and december 1992 he received rs 2.36 crore in three instalments .
another rs 1.46 crore arrived in four instalments between march 1995 and november 1999 .

that allows brokers to start trading in those shares without the knowledge of the investor who owns them .
online broking , though still in a very nascent stage , holds promise of faster information to the investor .
that could reduce the chances of rigging and manipulation by middlemen to some extent .

that is solely the job of the regulator .
the evaporation of the savings of thousands of small investors is bound to have some impact on consumer demand .

sharada raju , the artist being feted , has certainly not enjoyed too many happy moments in life .
at 40 , she lives on morphine injections and a pacemaker .
but through it all , sharada continues to paint .
she has painted with a drip needle inserted into one arm .
once she had a heart attack while painting .
she has even finished a painting in the run up to a heart surgery .
the painter ' s troubles started almost a decade after her marriage in 1977 .
but it turned out a case of ectopic ( out of womb ) pregnancy .
doctors were forced to perform a hysterectomy , taking away forever her ability to conceive .
that was only the beginning .
within a year , she had to undergo 29 surgeries , including 19 gynaecology - related microsurgeries .
then abdominal cancer was diagnosed .
soon after , she suffered a mild heart attack .
by 1990 , pain and disappointment had almost robbed sharada of her will to live .
she had been married when she was 17 .
now she was 30 , childless , and very , very ill .
then she remembered a childhood wish .

q . politics is overshadowing relations .
a . a trend has set in in which accepting the other ' s view is considered wrong .
let us respect a country ' s right to its own opinion .
but who ' s footing the bill ?
the 52 tickets on the united airlines flight were bought by vinod gupta , a millionaire nri .
reliance industries , mahindra and mahindra and raymonds have provided chartered flights in the gujarat sector .
part of the security is being provided by the government of india and various state governments .
the taj is the official caterer of the tour and chef satish arora will take care of clinton ' s food preferences throughout the trip .
at the taj ummed in ahmedabad , clinton liked his late indian dinner so much that it lasted a good three hours .
for clinton , the journey to kutch was defined by an indian summer of sorrow , as it was written on the face of nandeesh .
bharatnatyam was her first choice , but her frail body was obviously not up to it .
medical studies , too , were ruled out .
so , she took up painting .
her first painting was a picture of lord ganesha on canvas the size of reader ' s digest magazine .
now she has in her oeuvre nearly 600 paintings , including those of ram and krishna and about 200 of the elephant - headed god .
the senior raju was impressed .
in a testimonial written five years ago , he described her as an " accomplished artist " .
he added , " what is special is that these fine works were created during her protracted illness associated with agonising pain over many years .
he has been elected an mp six times .
yet , gogoi , 65 , is not overtly ambitious .
his colleagues are pinning hopes on his non - controversial image .
the only controversy he has been dragged into is the accusation by mahanta himself , of a nexus with the ulfa .
a union minister in the early 1990s , gogoi is used to pressure .
" i manage 20 minutes of exercises daily to beat the stress , " he says .
can he beat mahanta too ?
it continues to cause plenty of heartburn to bus and autorickshaw drivers and commuters alike .
" this is where , " alleges rfat ' s managing director sheetal singh , " the scam began to take root . "
singh refused and claims he is now paying the price for saying no .
subsequently , says singh , the iip refused to issue him a certificate clearing his cng kit .
delhi ' s transport minister parvez hashmi , who oversees dtc and is named in the affidavit , dismisses the charges , calling rfat a " roadside company " .
there is , however , evidence to prove that things may not have been all above board .
at the time the company did not have a background in such technology and had n ' t even submitted a proposal for the order .
" the asi is much better funded than we are to maintain the monuments , ' ' says a state government official .
amid the neglect the citadels that were symbols of a fierce independent spirit are beginning to look more like monuments to official apathy .
this evening of female hedonism is the festival of dhinga ganwar , celebrated about a month after holi .
she is a yogi whose only ambition is to touch the reassuring hand of god through devotion and works of arts . "
governor rama devi also chose an exhibition of sharada ' s works at the inauguration of a kalyana mandapam built by her father .
all her paintings are done with natural vegetable and earth colours she makes herself .
her dream is to open a museum of paintings where " i can teach the sick and handicapped people to forget their pain through painting " .
" life is a mixture of pain and joy and it is up to each individual to find the joy and forget the sorrow , " she says .
" i chose painting to forget the pain .
conceal vital details of parents including their whereabouts and date of admission into the placement organisation .
suppress news of a child ' s death by burying the body quietly on the campus .
4 . falsify and fabricate records to replace the dead infant with another .
make prospective parents pay more money for higher childcare expenses .
ignore sending reports to the state - level voluntary adoptions coordinating agency ( vaca ) .
allow an unrecognised adoption agency to route children through a recognised placement agency .

april 22 : asd ' s rao held in hyderabad ; chief minister announces a cash award for information about savithri .

two more homes raided , 59 rescued .
he will move focus from delhi to the sangh ' s traditional headquarters in nagpur .
while some interpret this as a dramatic shift , the sangh itself sees it as the culmination of a gradual corrective process .
if india is to emerge from poverty and despair , we will have to rely on the initiative of citizens and civil society .
fortunately , more and more people are becoming aware of this .
naturally , no major politician bothered to grace the event and the press ignored it because it was too preoccupied with covering the big fight .
ordinary citizens continue to face the brunt of the inspector raj .
less than half an hour later , the asom gana parishad ( agp ) office , about 2 km away , comes under attack from the rebels .
an agp worker and a police constable are killed .
das sustained serious injuries .
the outlawed united liberation front of asom ( ulfa ) has struck back with a vengeance .
the ulfa is an avowed non - believer in the indian constitution - polls included .
they hoped to capitalise on the fierce anger in the party at george ' s high - handedness in controlling access to sonia .
to emphasise this point , the dissidents also endorsed kapil sibal ' s candidature for the post of rajya sabha secretary .
earlier this year , sibal had publicly lambasted the sonia coterie .
aiims owes its uniqueness in some measure to the autonomy it enjoys .
as a result , it can frame its own curriculum and select the best faculty and the best research facilities without interference from other quarters .
not surprisingly one of aiims ' s strong points is the excellent and internationally acclaimed research in biomedical sciences .
it also offers an unmatched atmosphere .
" being with the best students and learning from ace clinicians is extremely inspiring , " says priyank jain , an intern .
it ' s this inspiration that keeps aiims hale and hearty and flying high .
however , a visit to the khamla anganwadi revealed that the stock of medicines and foodgrain for 112 children had not been replenished for the past two months .
says shakuntala omkar patlai who runs the centre : " we have sent many reminders but in vain .
we could have saved several lives if the administration had not taken two months to pass a tender . "
the state government has recently cleared the tender for supplying foodgrain to the 933 villages from may 15 .
the situation was similar at the fair - price shops in dhadgoan and akkalkua villages .
says suman divlya valvi , sarpanch of ghatli village : " we are tired of complaining about the non - availability of foodgrain in the ration shops .
ministerial and vip visits have got us nothing but promises . "
every time a vehicle enters these villages , it brings hope : of food , medicines and work opportunities .
to a great extent it is an honourably acquired reputation , for justice does n ' t often reach out from the ruler to the ruled here .
true , there may be instances when the media is more sensational and less revealing in its criticism of the judiciary .
then , the judiciary too tends to be oversensitive towards criticism .
it is not a weapon to silence criticism but a law to protect the dignity of the court .
and the privileges of democracy have made this law in many countries rather redundant .
the trade union leaders too claim credit for setting the privatisation process in order in their own way .
sterlite industries , which bought a 51 - per cent stake in balco for rs 551.5 crore , is hoping that the worst is over .
says chairman anil agarwal : " it was the biggest challenge of my life .
it ' s like buying a second - hand car .
sometimes you have to spend money on unexpected repair of such cars . "
" the labour unions had provided me a list of 25 demands .
i only had to persuade the balco management to discuss them , " informs rao .
union leaders claim that 24 of their 25 demands have been met .
but a closer scrutiny shows that this is not the case .
the management ' s logic is simple : payment of wages for days of strike will set a bad precedent for its other plants .
the company has also undertaken not to retrench anybody ( see box : the agreement ) .
q . what is your reaction to india ' s invitation to have talks at the highest level ?
a . general musharraf has always said we are ready for resumption of dialogue any time , any place , any level .
however , we are approaching the whole thing positively .
but we need to see india ' s approach before we can go into specifics .
for instance , the date of the talks .
a . the greatest need is to lend an ear to what the kashmiri people are saying .
that will be our number one priority .
if you wanted to know how mark mascarenhas was reinstated in the public eye , all it took was a trip to the wankhede stadium on a may night .
he told india today , " it was a terrible period for us and it did affect the morale of the people working within the company .
rebuilding is always a tough task . "
mascarenhas has built this business from small beginnings as a salesman for radio spots on cbs in the us in 1981 .
" i ' d never represented a player before .
the cases cover deals surrounding the independence cup of 1997 and the icc knock - out trophy of 1998 .
there are also allegations from sri lanka of the board being bribed .
this also ends a silly drama , the playwrights of which were some of mamata ' s lieutenants in kolkata .
bjp leaders were mystified .
nobody wanted her back , they said .
planted stories and selective leaks notwithstanding , mamata is back to square one .
we will discuss the reports of these committees and then see .
q . what about law and order ?
newspapers carry daily reports of kidnapping , murder and loot .
a . only newspapers that are hostile to the government are playing up such reports to create a fear psychosis .
the lashkar - e - toiba chief has reportedly threatened to kill the indian prime minister outside the red fort .
chennai journalists are green with envy at the access the network enjoys since amma returned to power .
when she called on the governor to effect some changes in the cabinet , no journalists were allowed into the raj bhavan - except those from jaya tv .
q . are you excited about returning to india ?
q . but you once wanted to wage war against india .
the philosophy of khalistan will continue whether i am there or not .
q . what do you plan to do after you reach punjab ?
the dress code is simple : you are the world , and you belong .
for casuals i buy something from cotton world or benetton , for formals i prefer versace , gabbana , armani and tommy hilfiger . "
satellite tvs blasting scores of international channels and the internet pushing the world towards one big clothes - knit village .
fashion consultant and writer meher castellino agrees : " it ' s the exposure to tv that has shaped the current global look in india .
actually indians have been aping the west since the british era ; only it is more pronounced now . "
karisma kapoor laughs confidently in her non - fussy polycrepe outfit with a bateau neckline ; the chic new look given to her by designer manish malhotra .
instead they choose cool limes , ambers and brackish greys .
general musharraf needs a dialogue with india .
he will use his visit to establish his legitimacy internationally and among his own people .
he will try to create a situation where he can tell the world that india is " not sincere " in resolving the kashmir dispute .
it would be a grave folly to agree to any such proposal .
pakistan is engaged in destabilisation throughout india .
it uses nepal and bangladesh to spread fundamentalism , terrorism and separatism in india .
the essence of good diplomacy lies in expanding cooperation while firmly making our concerns known .
we should prepare to move ahead on people to people contacts , trade and nuclear and conventional confidence - building measures .
once married to umrao jaan director muzaffar ali , she ' s no stranger to films .
those regal robes fit her nicely .
not for nothing that she said yes .
kamal haasan is digging into his bag of tricks again .
back home , border director j . p . dutta seems to have come close .
a kindly shopkeeper dragged her into his shop and pulled the shutters down but the gunfire frightened the little girl who started crying .
the girl was dead before anyone could tell what was happening .
this kind of thing happens too often in the kashmir valley for this incident to be considered an aberration .
what also serves their cause is the abject inability of the vajpayee government to articulate anything that could be described as a kashmir policy .
the man who should be doing the talking - and coming up with a policy - is home minister l . k . advani .
advani had a real chance to show the average kashmiri that he was ready to begin with a clean slate and look at what was happening with new eyes .
for reasons that are impossible to understand he chose instead to continue to let kashmir fester and burn without once acknowledging there are no military solutions to political problems .
we can only hope one of the fallouts of the summit will be that this will change .
or we are doomed to watching the general ' s " freedom fighters " increasingly perpetrate their evil deeds .
we keep hearing that we are winning the war against terrorism .
but in kashmir there are no signs of peace and innocent people continue to die .
this is india ' s real kashmir problem .
q . so you want peace , not war .
a . i believe it is in the interest of the people , country and social reforms that peace be restored .
to stop violence a dialogue is necessary .
for a dialogue congenial atmosphere and mutual trust are needed .
i am very serious about this .
q . will your government agree to the demand for constitutional changes ?
a . let us first agree to sit together .
we will talk .
willingness on both sides to talk to solve the problems is important .
q . the maoists seem to have confidence in you .
they demanded that you be made prime minister .
any reason ?
a . they did not say that i should be made prime minister .
my party has elected me the leader .
but i am sincere , this may have created their confidence .
q . do you expect them to be flexible ?
a . i do n ' t want to enter into a dialogue with doubts in my mind .
q . g . p . koirala ' s supporters were opposed to talks .
will they cooperate ?
a . nobody is opposed to talks .
i am confident of everybody ' s support .
q . what are your other priorities ?
a . to fight corruption , speed up development and alleviate poverty .
but let me settle down first .
the prime minister was right : " we are not looking for propaganda advantage or seeking to score debating points . "
all along , there was a very indian iron curtain between agra and the rest of the country , in spite of foreign minister jaswant singh ' s spokesmanship .
but there was only silence .
still , a statement is not the same as talking to the nation .
was he then deliberately underplaying agra ?
even if " quiet diplomacy " is the answer for the moment , it cannot be the full answer .
and the question of transparency in the affairs of the nation has relevance beyond agra .
for a country that takes pride in its democratic maturity , this institutionalised discomfort with information is a glaring incongruity .
information - or the manipulation of it - may be an effective instrument of subjugation for paranoid dictatorships .
not for a country like india .
liberalisation of information is the obligation of any democracy that has nothing to hide .
according to him , massacres of the amarnath pilgrims for the second consecutive year shows that militants want to sabotage any peace initiative in kashmir .
mufti mohammad sayeed , former union home minister , agrees and says , " common people are being sandwiched in the war of nerves between the two countries . "
even chief minister digvijay singh called to congratulate her .
bjp workers , meanwhile , were stunned and bharati herself shell - shocked .
the episode ended with the channel that claimed the scoop running grovelling apologies for 24 hours .
some people now say this was only a ruse to flush govindacharya out of his retreat .
his friends have a better theory : that it was a conspiracy by proponents of globalisation .
chandigarh : the akalis are quoting marie antoinette in their duel with punjab congress chief amarinder singh , which shows how far things have gone .
good , now history will only remember him as the man who allowed the babri masjid to be pulled down .
and although we hear about dramatic changes we do not see them .
as for what they call " social infrastructure " by which is usually meant health and education it remains disgraceful .
murli manohar joshi - the boss of human resource development - boasts of how we are now approaching a literacy rate of 70 per cent .
to which we really need to ask how he is measuring this .
usually anyone who can write his name is considered literate .
but is this all we want in an age of computer literacy ?
at present , there is a brigade - level ( around 3,500 men ) formation to man the island territories .
it is proposed that this number be increased to nearly division level ( around 8,000 men ) in the coming years .
but it is the surveillance capabilities that will give the anc its teeth .
intelligence inputs indicate that the great coco islands have a radar base - built with chinese help - with a 50 m high antenna since 1992 .
india has aworrisome neighbour to its west .
by setting up the anc , it seeks to reduce the likelihood of surprises on its eastern flank .
we will never break the dialogue .
in fact the government is now keen to widen the ambit of its dialogue in the northeast .
it wants to talk to all the insurgent groups .
learning from its manipur experience , the government has already begun extensively consulting the chief ministers of the region .
officials say prime minister atal bihari vajpayee himself spoke to these leaders on the modalities of negotiating with the insurgent groups .
the former meghalaya chief minister , who is now a member of the constitution review committee , looks forward to his new assignment .
" i would like to make some contribution to establishing peace in the northeast , " he says .
to mollify jamir , the government has decided to set up a three - member panel with sangma and two others .
we will cooperate with him , " says a now pleased jamir who is on the proposed panel .
the optimism of the government in initiating peace in the northeast is not shared by those who follow insurgency in the region .
they feel the nagas ca n ' t be taken for granted .
delhi cannot continue to treat the nscn ( i - m ) in a cavalier manner .
peace with this group is imperative because this is the strongest militant outfit in south - east asia after the liberation tigers of tamil eelam .
with a cadre strength of 4,000 and 3,500 modern weapons the nscn has been running mercenary training camps for other insurgent groups in the region .
which is why if the dialogue collapses , the northeast may once again come in the grip of another spell of violence .
it is a race against the clock which they could still win .
in this season of plenty , there is more : indian badminton has undergone a renaissance after a player - revolt in 1997 .
the presence of two players in olympic competition is the result of long hours of grunt work come to fruition .
the indian fight squad recognises that source itself .
there used to be a time when an indian name in a boxing draw would draw a yawn .
i recount this particular story also because it is multi - faceted in its representation of the features and consequences of corruption in india .
think what the cost of bribes must be at our state government level if municipal officials ask for rs 75 lakh ?
well , why bother when we all know that by the time it gets to the centre , we speak of crores not lakhs .
tehelka was not even the tip of the dung heap , it was only a small whiff .
another interesting facet of the story is that it comes from one of our poorest states .
the state government - the condition of anonymity prevent me from naming it - never ceases to beg in delhi for more money .
its primary excuse for being one of the worst governed , least developed states in india is that it is too poor to do better .
instead , it goes into the pockets of officials who in a less humane society would have been shot for stealing public money .
according to sebi guidelines of august 4 , 1994 , the minimum price of an ril share in october 1994 on preferential allotment worked out to rs 377 .
it has a way of finding communal conspiracies in cultural traditions .
and it is good at making the word fascism sound so familiar .
secularly modern does n ' t mean that you have to repudiate your cultural or civilisational heritage , that religious rhymes with communal .
and of vedic astrology as a subject , it is perhaps as relevant and academically rewarding as gender studies .
conditions at hyderabad ' s famous salar jung museum are no better than those in mumbai and chennai .
these are indians who have risen above their circumstances , forged by the white heat of contest , grown extraordinary by their sport .
this is your team .
man ' s best friend is in actuality , studies indicate , one of his most vicious killers .
if you have n ' t guessed yet - we ' re talking about the dog .
out of these 30,000 die a slow , torturous death due to rabies .
india has the dubious distinction of being the country where 70 per cent of all rabies deaths in the world takes place .
she would have been dangerously out of place in today ' s fractured polity and media intrusiveness .
perhaps that is why her real elevation to the status of durga is entirely posthumous .
in the imagined indira , the people of india identify resolve , strength and patriotic ruthlessness .
she would n ' t have stomached the insults , digested the assaults on nationhood and capitulated to the blackmailers and hijackers .
an instance : in 1996 choudhury , on deputation to the kohima municipality , saw a row of unusual items up for sale right outside the town hall .
his notable field works include surveys of the white - winged wood duck in assam and arunachal pradesh and of the gaur ( indian bison ) in the northeast .
a phd on the primates of assam behind him , choudhury is currently pursuing a doctor of science degree from gauhati university .
" my agenda also includes bhutan , eastern nepal , southern tibet , north and western myanmar and eastern bangladesh , " he says .
that ' s some project for this man on a singular mission .
the police undid the damage in about an hour .
three days later , the hackers struck again .
the cyber gumshoes observed that several attempts had been made to enter the police ' s site from two particular internet protocol ( ip ) addresses in july .
both belonged to cyber cafes in dadar .
the low incidence of rabies worldwide is having a serious impact in india as far as availability of vaccines is concerned .
there are two rabies vaccines available .
the common one manufactured in india - called the nerve vaccine - costs rs 600 for 6 shots .
the trouble is , this vaccine is known to generate allergic reactions and in rare cases even causes paralysis .
the other recommended thing is to wash the bite wound with water and soap .
this simple act , doctors add , can reduce the risk of rabies by 30 per cent .
lastly , never become complacent if you learn that the dog that has bitten you has been inoculated .
the leader , every morning of august 15 , is a receptacle of will and vision , for a couple of ceremonious moments at least .
really , going by those red fort performances , india should have reached superpowerhood years ago .
prime ministers come and go , talking utopia , but india continues to remain what it is : a land of dead promises and zero political vision .
and one more ritual at the red fort last wednesday .
he will turn " every stone " of this land for a better india .
hence the sos to the centre : tame the tormentor , call back her chief gestapos .
in the irrational dravidian feud , third parties can do nothing except watch the never - ending farce .
called the national highway development programme ( nhdp ) , it ' s the biggest project since sher shah suri built the grand trunk road in the 14th century .
he has advanced the deadline for the first phase of the programme to 2003 from 2004 .
by then he should have the 5,834 - km golden quadilateral connecting the metros ready .
though this time the romance of the so - called investigative journalism stinks .
is it worth the truth ?
and here comes the ethics question , the limits of pursuit .
are methods that are not socially or legally acceptable journalistically acceptable ?
the gotcha morality of the tabloids will say dammit .
but responsible journalism , or quality journalism , cannot afford to be independent of ethics .
the best example is the american quality press , whose almost fanatical obsession with ethics is born of a sense of fairness .
israel has taken offence over the dubbing of zionism as racism and along with the us has threatened to boycott the meet .
india , of course , has no such option .
it is , after all , hoping to get into the security council and ca n ' t afford to fritter any good - will it has mustered .
delhi : retired navy chiefs have become more equal to former prime ministers .
till recently , the only government officials allowed to retain government employees in their personal service after retirement were prime ministers .
the official word is that these personnel will assist the former chiefs in times of ailments , though they will be with the chiefs at all times .
admiral kumar , meanwhile , retires in four months .
the fortuitous bestowing of man fridays is sheer coincidence .
lucknow : uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh is fond of highlighting his government ' s achievements .
so he wants a probe into the note .
suspects do n ' t get legal representation .
the taliban has said the aid workers will be put on trial .
" after the investigation , the court will decide according to shariat ( islamic ) law , " said the foreign minister .
nine - month - old govind had acute complications since birth , kidney and heart problems and a missing anal tract .
despite financial problems , meeta and her husband , a driver in mauritius , arrived in india and later left quite contented .
clearly , initiative and collaboration between the government and medical authorities may be the right prescription .
dramatic move : the company theatre stages a play in a suburban home in mumbai
alternative venues have given drama in the city a new energy .
kumar organises plays twice a month with wife sheela chadha .
private bungalows and apartments , dilapidated godowns , boutiques and art galleries are not beyond the creative grasp of these actors .
it is ingenuity born more of compulsion than choice in a city where the premium on space is high .
to them , the moot question is that of building an audience base , not influencing a non - existent one .
kashipur , about 400 km from the state capital bhubaneswar , falls in one of the state ' s poorest districts .
irrigation is practically non - existent in the hilly terrain and the land is not conducive to farming .
when the rains are good , they are able to grow some crops .
at other times , they scour for food and do odd jobs .
no matter what the cause of the deaths - food poisoning or hunger - the suffering people of the region have few options .
having tasted blood , these contractors , who seem to enjoy political patronage , are at work again .
by painting a doomsday scenario of mass death through starvation , they probably want to attract new projects and in the process , more money .
the hunger of the tribals is the least of their concerns .
the revelations considerably eroded the website ' s moral authority .
yet neither mamata ' s reinduction into the nda nor tehelka ' s unedifying methods can herald fernandes ' acquittal .
the panel , which began functioning since march , was originally supposed to submit its findings in four months but has now got an extension till november .
his wives lie buried just 5 km from bijapur at a place that now bears titular testimony to the uxoricide - saatth kabar ( 60 graves ) .
but official acceptance of responsibility for its upkeep is not too evident .
the tombstones are scarred by graffiti , and people often come to the shady spot for rest or boisterous fun .
he laments that there is not even a proper road leading to the monument .
apart from the famous gol gumbaz , bijapur , or the " city of victory " , has 50 mosques and 20 historic tombs .
but the asi has no money to protect them .

the destruction of wtc was " this generation ' s pearl harbour " .

in those days , gloats ram , their clientele included the mughals .
ram even loads bangles in sacks and makes house calls if there ' s a special request .
he does this when he makes bangles to order , especially for weddings , matching them with the colour and embroidery of the bride ' s trousseau .
ram ' s fame has spread far from his little shop .
he gets orders from the us and europe .
he has even been invited to attend indian festivals in paris and los angeles .
unlike others of his tribe , ram ' s speciality is that he designs and crafts the bangles himself .
at the end of the exercise she will be adept at keeping her nerves under control .
laloo and arafat both donated blood .
gujarat chief minister keshubhai patel , with his great experience in handling calamities and relief operations , could hardly sit back and do nothing .
so the gujarat government decided to despatch about 250 doctors to new york .
the plan seemed perfect until someone realised that none of these doctors would be allowed to practise in the us without valid licences issued by the authorities there .
the sudden surge in his weight was traced to the 2 kg silver sword he had been presented earlier on at the function .
for years , the charismatic masood was the face of the anti - taliban resistance .
his death was a mortal blow to the front , but with the us going after the taliban it quickly regrouped its forces .
to fill the void left by masood , the front adopted a collegiate approach .
much like the queen of england , president burhanuddin rabbani continues to remain a titular head .
mohammed fahim khan , masood ' s trusted lieutenant , has taken his place as defence minister .
like masood , he belongs to the panjshir valley and has served him for over 20 years .
" i am only a gear which has been added for better coordination . "
whether keshubhai will rise to the occasion is a matter of speculation .
as is the question of whether he will be able to make any difference .
in sabarkantha , keshubhai was taken to task on a different count .
although sabarkantha is a traditional congress stronghold , the state bjp had spent a huge amount of money on campaigning to outdo the rival party .

it ' s better to die that way than live like this . "
as demonstrated by the success of vajpayee ' s us visit , the move is beginning to pay returns .
at the same time , there has been an unintended political cost of this - almost obsessive - preoccupation with foreign policy .
there is anger over the onrush of cheap imports that threatens to bankrupt small - scale entrepreneurs who had prospered in a protected environment .
there is restiveness in the backward hindi heartland and eastern india over the growing disparity between regions .
at the same time , the more successful states are resentful of having to subsidise their more slothful counterparts .
apart from being dictated by foreign policy , the reforms have by and large been followed by a top - down command approach .
there has been almost no attempt to sell them politically .
even the enormous populist potential of disinvestment has n ' t been exploited by a party committed to dismantling socialism .
given his health problems and discomfiture with economics , vajpayee has been non - communicative about the political rationale behind reforms .
he has made many right moves but without explaining why .
the larger goal behind the painful process of structural adjustment has been left unaddressed .
nor have his ministers undertaken the task .
it ' s this fundamental insecurity , masked in a cloak of sycophancy , that is preventing the government from grasping its underlying vulnerability .

when manohar was transferred to amudalavalasa , the couple put their through the weight - training regimen at the ammi naidu gym in the district headquarters town of srikakulam .
malleshwari ' s career took off after she won silver in the 1991 senior nationals in ambala .

if the sheer swank of china ' s 20 years of economic growth is a humbling experience , the sense of history is even more overwhelming .

beijing ' s attempt to neutralise its variant of the kashmir problem was three - phased .

by harinder baweja hizb - ul - mujahideen . once the name spelt terror .
the kashmiri militant group was always described as dreaded and hardcore .
delhi was nervous for different reasons .
remember those bomb blasts in mumbai in 1993 that killed more than 200 people ?
and , they do .
it is because of corrupt officials and politicians that our most sacred rivers have become sewers .
crores of rupees have been washed down the ganga because the action plan to clean it leaked like a sieve .
as an ordinary citizen may i make a few simple suggestions ?
the international isolation predicted after the pokhran nuclear tests now appears a remote prospect .
yet if diplomacy has been the vajpayee regime ' s success story in the past 12 months , economics is the achilles ' heel .
the second phase still awaits a time - table - and a political vision .
in april this year , the prime minister received reports from four advisory committees he had set up .
the trauma of rajkumar ' s family and his numerous fans is understandable but even they must be getting exasperated by veerappan ' s games .
otherwise , it is not beyond the arsenal of the indian state to preserve both rajkumar ' s life and his country ' s dignity .
the prevailing nationhood , it said , was too " white " , too english and by definition excluded black and asian britons .
defining britain , on the other hand , is a respect for authority , a fetish for privacy and a fanatical commitment to courtesies .
however nebulous , there is something called a national character that verges on the mystical .
there is an imagined nation that exists above both the law and popular icons .
what matters is the minority ' s desire to seek emotional compatibility with the imagined nation and the majority ' s readiness to be inclusive .
sudarshan ' s desire to minimise sectarian conflict is understandable but his remedy is sledge - hammer and his tone too righteous .
if taken to its logical conclusion the proposal has the potential to vitalise india ' s comatose privatisation programme .
the supreme court ' s verdict should put the seal on the narmada debate
when completed , the project will irrigate 18 lakh hectares of parched land and generate 1,450 mw of electricity .
the global debate on big dams has added to the obstacles , causing the world bank to withdraw from the project .
today , the anti - narmada brigade is a loose confederation of ngos , alternative development theorists , naxalites , rss cottage industrywallahs , luddites at large .
the ceasefire call helps the hizb in its battle for supremacy over other militant groups .
the government saw advantages for itself as well .
the fact that salahuddin endorsed the ceasefire call from pakistani soil is not without significance .
by 1900 , it began mass manufacturing for civilians , without losing its edge in military supplies .
its flex brand of shoes had become popular in india two decades before bata was a household name .
the british owners left with independence , and it took the indian successors no more than five years to make the units sick beyond repair .
at tafco ' s administrative block , powered by a diesel generator , the buzzword now is vss , or voluntary separation scheme .
it cannot be called a retirement scheme because of a stay order on vrs from the high court .
there is also a stay on bifr ' s winding - up order under the companies act , 1956 .
the vss is unlikely to attract the employees , who come to the work place only to sign the register .
many of them are housed in the 600 residential quarters that the founders had built .
the salaries , though irregular , are guaranteed .
vss is made further unattractive because there has n ' t been a pay revision since 1987 .
it ' s a tall order , considering the average monthly salary of rs 4,916 , which is the highest in the industry .
once freed from its legacy of manufacturing , the sprawling 176 - acre tafco complex will be prime real estate .
there is n ' t a single mba on its staff .
the brass ' current chief agenda is to persuade the union textile ministry into a new financial commitment .

the massacre took place the day american president bill clinton began his five - day trip to india .
it began during clinton ' s march visit when kashmir figured high on the agenda .
more recently , emissaries of washington dc have been meeting pakistan - based jamait - e - islami ( jei ) chief qazi hussain .
of significance is his meeting with us counter - terrorism chief michael sheehan , for the hizb is the armed wing of the jei .
in a space of a month , the centre has dabbled in autonomy , a dialogue with the hurriyat conference and now the ceasefire call .
the time in between will be fraught with danger , for the ceasefire call may not play out on the lines of " give peace a chance " .
in such a situation , it would be difficult for the security forces to adhere to the conditions of the ceasefire agreement .
it is therefore an agreement whose fate could well have been sealed even before it has been given a real chance .

what prompts jaya jaitly , the ethnic - arty president of the samata party to lash out at two ministers of her government from within the ruling nda combine ?
or is it purely an instinctive knee - jerk reaction of a mother protective of her daughter ' s childhood friend ?
was she addressing the media in her private capacity as aditi ' s mother or was she taking an official stand as the president of the samata party ?
the construction of these temples can be traced to the 1950s when people started gathering regularly around a peepul tree in the compound to sing kirtans .
the temples came up in the 1970s and the latest one was constructed this year .
one of the temple committee members spoke of rectifying sher shah ' s building agenda .
" sher shah constructed a lot , " he says authoritatively , " but forgot one thing - a temple . "
sasaram , known for its communal unease , does n ' t need a reassessment of sher shah ' s religious policy .
according to muhammed k . k . , since 1977 over 16 complaints have been registered regarding this illegal construction but no action has ever been taken .
on the other hand the former bjp mla jawahar prasad was of the opinion that they were only trying to fulfil the demands of the locals .
" if anybody wants to stop the building work , he will do so at his own risk , " warns prasad .
" our stand is very clear , " she says , " we have to protect the monument against illegal construction .
we hope the state government does something soon .
otherwise a court case will remain the only option . "
and we all know how long this can take .
by sayantan chakravarty coincidences rarely get more intriguing .
his agency is the sole distributor in sikkim with 28 lotteries .
mla ' s sister concern , best and co , operates 77 lotteries in thimpu , in violation of the spirit and rules of the trade .
the incident has brought the trade ' s seamier aspects to the fore .
the april 18 incident shows how draws can be fixed by colluding officials and unscrupulous operators . "
among those named were usman fayaz , mla ' s chief executive and current president of the all - india federation .
among the facts unearthed by the crime branch were that the society had printed only 2.4 lakh of the proposed 24 lakh tickets .
the result : ticket sales fetched rs 1.2 crore but prizes worth only rs 12,000 were given away .
mla claims that the draws of april 18 were a coincidence .
no prize winner has ever complained , it says .
as for trying to bring pressure on parliamentarians in the committee , he says , " we do n ' t pressure them .
but by then hil had expanded its ddt capacity to over 27,000 tonnes at its three plants in delhi , rasayani in maharashtra and alwaye in kerala .
the ban dealt hil a critical blow because agriculture accounted for three - quarters of the total ddt use .
so the machinery could not be moved out to either of hil ' s existing facilities in maharashtra and kerala .
the company is moving the delhi unit to bhatinda in punjab , but without the ddt facility .
this is in deference to the state government ' s objection .
this relevance should not be measured in the areas of cooperation alone , however important they may be .
but the significance of mgc lies beyond the signed agreements .
the idea was born during thai foreign minister surin pitsuwan ' s visit to delhi in july .
a few days later in bangkok , on the margins of the asean post - ministerial conference , the mekong five and india formally endorsed the project .
meanwhile , suspending the manufacture of asvs at the institute is likely to affect the availability of the serum in the country .
it produces 75,000 vials a year .
the production process takes up to six months from the time the venom is injected to when the serum is ready .
the bengal chemicals &amp; pharmaceuticals limited ( bcpl ) factory at maniktala in calcutta is heavy with the aroma of unsold and semi - finished soaps and perfumes .
it is also teeming with nostalgia .
in 1998 - 99 , against an installed capacity of 150 tonnes of soap , bcpl produced only 40 kg .
even for drugs , more than half the capacity lies unused .
bcpl has escaped being a candidate for disinvestment due to its " core industry " status as a drug manufacturer .
the latter is a questionable claim , for bcpl hardly has the volume to influence the prices of prescription drugs .
just as we will forget what the supreme court said about the behaviour of the chief ministers of karnataka and tamil nadu .
would it not invite citizens to become a law unto themselves ?
it may lead to anarchy . "
bandits and terrorists invariably go free but ordinary indians can find themselves in jail for no crime at all .
it was of a man i know well as a law - abiding citizen with no police record .
his only " offence " was that he went to a wedding party and had a few drinks .
when he did he was beaten up and thrown into jail for the night .
he never got his money back and might have stayed in jail had his employer not come to his rescue .
such needless harassment of ordinary citizens constitutes routine police work in india .
in villages , things are so much worse that ordinary people especially women keep as far away from the police as possible .
their contempt for the law comes also from their knowledge of collusion between the police and the most notorious criminals in their area .
it has become worse over the years because many of these criminals now move easily into politics .
just asif you read the writing on the wallveerappan will probably do one day .
and though the police have spent 10 years apparently unable to find him , tamil politicians seem to find him quite easily .
how long will it be before he enters parliament ?
because jaitly is not a run - of - the - mill politician .
jaitly has worked assiduously to win for herself an image that derives from the likes of late pupul jayakar , her first mentor .
but jaitly has not yet achieved the unquestioned nationwide respect that both her role models commanded within the artistic community .
but baffling questions about how and why he was released linger .
one of the first repercussions of the film star ' s release is a sense of embarrassment for tamil nadu chief minister m . karunanidhi .
the fact that p . nedumaran , a known ltte sympathiser who went as the official emissary and negotiated the release , spoke volumes .
the other curious part of the episode is the role of dr bhanu , a quarry owner .
while rajkumar initially credited her with letting veerappan believe he was ill , he retracted his statement later .
intelligence sources now believe that besides the tamil fringe groups , mafia politics too played a part .
one of the theories is that rajkumar ' s family had run into debts with some quarry owners and veerappan may have helped them get their money back .
now under tarpaulin .
67 acres : includes the disputed site .
the area was acquired by the centre in january 1993 .
the vhp wants some land released for initial construction .
54 acres : land in possession of uttar pradesh government since 1980s .
now with centre .
2.77 acres : most of the land was bought by vhp .
some was owned by muslims , others .
bjp government acquired it all in 1991 but a year later hc nullified this .
chakravarty is basu ' s seasoned drum - beater , having once likened his mentor to lord krishna .
so his farewell compliment to the former chief minister caused no more than a few chortles .
his successor , buddhadev bhattacharya , on the other hand , takes a single pilot , with strict instructions to the drivers not to hoot unless absolutely necessary .
the fortress - like indira bhavan is almost a parallel centre of power , with a six - member staff which draws its salary from the state government .
apparently , bhattacharya , who was the deputy chief minister till basu ' s retirement , was in the dark about the change in rules .
later on , when newspersons pointed it out to him , he said , " we have to look into it . "
but he wore a puzzled expression .
there is in fact a lot for bhattacharya and most of his ministerial colleagues to feel puzzled about over basu ' s recent antics .
last month , basu arrived in delhi a few days after bhattacharya ' s first visit to the centre after becoming the chief minister .
from delhi , bhattacharya flew to bagdogra in north bengal to address rallies in areas affected by terrorist attacks .
these include the cabinet system of decision - making , work culture of government employees and a sense of responsibility in labour actions .
for the first time in many years , attendance time of the staff is being recorded at writers ' buildings .
q : but the cbi has provided hard evidence to the malaysian authorities . . .
q : some say you were the one who exploited the friendship .
a : no .
i am proud of the friendship .
i have great regard for them .

otherwise i love the country .
we have friends in india .
i and my wife had four kids on your soil .
q : you say you are innocent , yet you moved the ae services funds to so many countries . . .
a : it is not kickback money .
there is no evidence that i received the money from bofors .
q : the malaysian police arrested you .
are they convinced that you are at fault . . .
a : the malaysians , like the indians , are friendly people .
they are doing this at the behest of the indian government .
what exactly happened on july 25 ?
bal thackeray was arrested and produced in court .
the maharashtra government stated that investigations were complete , the chargesheet would be filed shortly , and the accused was not required for interrogation .
the defence prayed for bail .
what are the terms for limitation ?
section 468 of the crpc specifies that no court shall take cognisance of an offence after the expiry of the period of limitation .
what was the reason for the delay ?
much of the delay ( from march 4 , 1995 to october 1999 ) was because the sena - bjp combine was in power .
june 12 1990 : us $ 5.3m credited to code - named arabica , robusta , luxor accounts in austria from swiss bank accounts in geneva .
in a christmas bonanza , prime minister atal bihari vajpayee announced a series of social development programmes .
the problem is the very scheme was outlined with matching fanfare on august 15 .
it is fair to ask if any progress has been made over four months .
india has never lacked blueprints or , in fact , money for social welfare measures .
the mission has always been there , the missionary zeal absent .
a squadron of pakistani f - 16 fighter - bombers take off from masroor airbase near karachi and head south into the arabian sea .
swinging south - east towards gujarat , they streak in low at wave - top level .
undetected by radars , they cross the coast , dropping their deadly payload .
scary scenario , even if it is a hypothetical one . but the armed forces fear that their worst nightmare is just waiting to come true .
the state now tops our threat perception on the west coast , says a top naval official .
and for good reason .
over 40 warships , including submarines , and fighter aircraft participated in the war exercises .
warships and fighter aircraft practised offensive manoeuvres against a blizzard of low - flying aircraft and missiles .
missile boats staged mock attacks on installations and marine commandos simulated saboteurs infiltrating the coast .
ships of the coast guard , tasked with damage control , rehearsed techniques to contain oil spillages .
risks to the gulf of kutch include attacks from enemy missile boats , submarines or even an aircraft sowing mines at the mouth of the harbour .
it would take at least a week to clear one shipwreck from the gulf , say naval officials .
there was no question of the government according sanction for prosecution against thackeray .
why did the sharad pawar government add to the delay ?
but what about the delay in according a sanction ?
so the case ca n ' t be barred by limitation .
besides , courts are bestowed with discretionary powers like crpc section 473 to take cognisance even after a case is deemed time - barred . "
what steps should the state government have taken ?
but just like the macaloo burger , the cruises are being tailored to suit indian tastes - and their not - so - deep pockets .
last year , 23,000 indians travelled with star cruises .
the first to offer cruise holidays from india , iocl hopes to make cruising in warm weather climes popular in the winters .
increasingly , indian companies are getting into the business and many of them are focusing on the beautiful coastline of india .
let ' s call this piece musings from goa .
goa ' s prosperity makes you think of other things .
that historical problem could well have been over if certain indian leaders had not chosen to deliberately meddle with democracy in kashmir .
remember the dismissal of farooq abdullah ' s legitimately elected government in 1983 ?
" but the remand application called for a view on the merits of the case , " argues advocate mahesh jethmalani .
the supreme court has also ruled that arrest is not a precondition to filing a chargesheet .
why was permission required for thackeray ' s arrest ?
the state government ' s sanction was sought on april 24 , 1994 and given on july 20 , 2000 .
was the arrest wrong ?
" it felt like any of the latest fighters that i have flown , " he observed .
as planned kothiyal then headed back to bangalore airport to land .
the two mirage aircraft hovered above him like sentinels as he brought the nose in line with the runway and descended .

as it rolled into the hangar the dignitaries broke into a wild round of clapping .
later a jubilant fernandes told the team , " there is only going forward from here .
we should not worry about the critics . "
from the hundreds of products it once offered , the basket has only 17 now .
and even these are formulations based on outsourced bulk drugs .
lack of working capital does not allow the company to buy the bulk drugs in required quantities .
it is nothing but a trade operation on a small scale .
but there was no response .
the reason is obvious ; the company ' s liabilities will put off any buyer .
idpl ' s total loan obligation at the close of the last fiscal was rs 1,595 crore .
how can we remain in business ? "
however , the real cause of idpl ' s sickness lies in politics .
as a result , the workforce has ballooned , the wage bill alone accounting for two - thirds of the operating expenses in most of the past five years .
salaries add to the company ' s loan burden every year .
by thinking big , the architects of the " temples of modern india " unwittingly provided for future golden handshakes .
these add up to approximately $ 1.5 million or more than rs 7 crore in prize money over a 12 - month period .
no other asian country holds such a large range of international tournaments , only five other nations in the world offer more .
but the contradictions begin right there .
except in pro tennis , there is a road which leads from the low to the high and today , no indian looks capable of attempting that journey .
out of 23 indian men ranked on the atp computer , only one , leander paes , is ranked in the top 200 .
in a sport getting younger , the average age of the indian davis cup team is 25 .
longtime coach akhtar ali laughs , " god help indian tennis . "
in 2000 , out of the 14 international tournaments for men , only three indians won singles titles .
" what ' s happening to indian tennis is like what happened to industry .
we are looking at 16 - and 18 - year - olds to make use of them . "
in a sport that defines itself by teenager burnout , 24 or 25 is already over the hill .
time is precious in pro tennis .
if you are out for three months you have lost chances . "
vece paes , who has worn many hats in indian tennis , as parent , tournament promoter and medical man , thinks indians should start earlier .
they need to be playing globally six months of the year .
the money is available but can it be coaxed away at least in part from the razzle - dazzle events towards more mundane pursuits ?
mahesh bhupathi dismisses criticism of poor use of resources , saying the indian circuit has crossed the million dollar mark only this year .
the situation , he admits , is far from ideal , " you ca n ' t look for champions , you have to groom them .
give the system time .
it requires a rethink of methods in both trainees and trainers .
aita secretary anil khanna says the processes are being put in place .
it will bring real profit only if indian tennis can rise beyond its current status of charming struggler and charmed spectator .
it has also signed an agreement for licensed production and technology transfer of another 100 su - 30 aircraft that could cost around rs 10,000 crore .
the iaf is still keen to pick up the lca .
meanwhile , employees of the ada , the pivotal institution of the project , burst crackers at the headquarters when harinarayana entered his office .
he had taken over as lca ' s director way back in 1986 under troubled conditions and at the relatively young age of 44 .
he recalled with a chuckle : " they could n ' t find another murga ( chicken ) to head it . "
for years harinarayana struggled to knit the country ' s fractious aeronautics community and had to build facilities virtually from scratch .
it was one of the reasons why the project took so long .
another reason was that the government decided that much of the technology for the lca project should be developed in india itself .
barring a little " hand holding " by some us and european firms , the team did much of its work on its own .
the gas turbine research establishment was entrusted with the task of designing the engine for the lca .
christened kaveri , work on it started way back in 1989 with a sanction of rs 760 crore .
but the laboratory has struggled to master its complex technology and now expects to have the engine operational only by next year .
aatre reckons the lca would be operational by 2007 .
hal chairman c . g . krishnadas nair is already readying the public - sector giant to take up the task .
" the lca is hal ' s future , " he says .
then there is the bcci ' s own vehicle , the game of cricket in india .
in the aftermath of bookiegate , its image has not only been tainted but wrecked beyond repair .
strangely enough , the men at the helm think that all it needs is a little touch - up job .
unless the setting up of a website and introduction of video feedback system approximately 10 years after the rest of the world are considered radical .
believed to have been planted by the first parsi settlers who brought it from the land they left , the mango tree has its own tale to tell .
villagers like gangli mahale , a 75 - year - old tribal widow , vouch for it .
" it was at least 40 yards away when i was 15 , " she says .
the unique phenomenon , which has attracted many researchers , occurs quite simply .
as the tree grows , its branches extend in a bow - like shape .
when the extended branches touch the ground , they begin to take root .
" the stems creep for a long distance in this way , " notes the manual .
by refusing to contest the six posts that were left in the general category congressmen will have forced sonia to go slow on affirmative action .
as for the new aicc team , she is likely to take the safe route and avoid any drastic overhaul .
but this is all in a good cause you will say .
after all , should n ' t the citizens of delhi be entitled to clean air .
so , how can it be called disgusting ?
for a start , because delhi ' s air is not going to become any cleaner by closing a few factories down .
more than 60 per cent of the pollution in the city ' s air is caused by vehicular traffic .
the buses continue to vomit their pollutants into delhi ' s air and the protesting workers continue to keep their jobs .
so , how is it that the move to close the factories down has been seemingly so successful ?
the simple answer to that question : there is money to be made .
if you can afford to pay off the inspectors when they come with their seals you can pollute as much as you like and still remain open .
so , ever since the business of closing down factories began much money has exchanged hands .
often factory owners pay the bribes the inspectors demand because many of these factories are in so - called residential areas .
you can stay open as long as you have enough money for bribes .
who is to blame ?
not the supreme court because it is clearly trying hard to clean up delhi ' s environment .
not the factory owners who built their factories in the wrong place because they had no choice .
not even the corrupt inspectors because corruption to them is a way of life .
no , the blame lies entirely with the delhi government and with governments in general .
were they sleeping when these illegal factories and vast illegal industrial estates were being built ?
why did n ' t someone put a stop to things earlier ?
should n ' t someone be trying to punish the officials who closed their eyes to what was going on when it could have been stopped ?
should not governments that have been unable to provide the basic necessities of urban life - drinking water , sanitation , electricity - be punished for their failures ?
would somebody like to go to the supreme court with another public - interest litigation to demand these things ?
if the court is serious about cleaning up delhi ' s environment then let it train its guns on the real criminals : government officials and agencies .
we cannot have one set of rules for ordinary indians and another for the government .
there are two reasons why this book is a must .
first , it successfully exposes india ' s own criminal ignorance of developments on the other side of the durand line .
the point needs to be stressed unambiguously .
after filing his nomination papers he met deputy editor swapan dasgupta and associate editor farzand ahmed to discuss the challenges before him as the party chief .
q . what are the main challenges before you as party president ?
a . to preserve the government ' s maryada and at the same time ensure the party ' s growth and expansion .
q . what about indiscipline in the party ?
a . this is the problem of growth .
yet workers think power is the centre around which everything revolves .
workers want something from the government but the party is not in a position to give it .
as does osama bin laden ' s crusade against the us .
it ' s not that the us is unaware of this nexus .
however , for india , the same compulsions do n ' t hold .
if one provides the logistical direction and the funding , the other gives permanent sanctuary and the ideological inspiration .
that ' s unlikely to happen because pakistan is no longer an independent entity .
it ' s an extension of a criminal network based in kandahar .
he has matured as a minister and a political strategist .
but fernandes cannot afford to rest on his laurels .
given the natural wildness of his samata colleagues , he must try and inculcate in them a sense of restraint and responsibility .
that ' s a tall order but for the sake of the larger good , he must try .
with ngos playing politics , development takes a back seat in orissa
orissa is a state where the disaster industry not only thrives but acquires international dimensions .
adding to the emotive fervour is the fact that utkal aluminia , the promoter , is a consortium of both indian and multinational companies .
for the opponents of the project , the agitation is crucial .
they hope to sufficiently vitiate the atmosphere so there is pressure on the mncs to pull out .
such a strategy has worked well in the past in orissa , a state that suffers from a lack of industrialisation .
it may work again in kashipur , despite the fact that the total number of families likely to be displaced by the project wo n ' t exceed 250 .
but there is a larger question that has to be asked .
must the development of poor regions be held to ransom by the activities of a motivated handful ?
private power producers are not allowed to sell to anybody other than state electricity boards .
in enron ' s case , only the mseb , its sole customer , can sell this power .
it will be distributed equally in the western grid consisting of maharashtra , gujarat and goa .
selling enron ' s power through the ptc will bring down costs and ensure 100 per cent capacity utilisation .
does india really need enron phase ii ?
with as much 80 per cent of construction of phase ii complete and trial runs due this week , this question is now academic .
indian financial institutions have also invested heavily in the project .
what is the way out ?
chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has set up a committee to examine the entire project .
kirit parikh of the indira gandhi centre of development research advises the state government to push enron for more concessions .
" options for restructuring the dpc ' s debt should be explored , " he says .
dpc officials are wary of touching the ppa a second time but have spoken of ways to reduce the financial burden .
" we ' re looking at a mix of solutions , ' ' says mcgregor .
these could range from the sale of power to other states and blocks to central bodies like the ntpc .
another solution to the power tangle would be to allow the private producers to sell directly to consumers .
that would keep the cash - strapped sebs out of harm ' s way .
for mseb the tonic lies in tremendous political will on the part of the state government .
just recovering its dues from , say , rich sugarcane farmers will add rs 5,000 crore to the mseb ' s kitty .
but in the power play of politics cutting subsidies is one trip no politician worth his khadi cap is willing to take .
history textbooks paint him as one who survived against all odds because of his strength .
they swore by india , so much so that neither of them wavered after hostilities broke out in 1962 between india and china .
vajpayee has compelled the leaders of these nations to think of india as a nation of the future , not of the past .
p . v . narasimha rao visited indonesia in 1992 and vietnam in 1994 but he is hardly remembered there .
perhaps because nobody thought at that time that india had much to offer .
a . we have to follow the nda agenda which has got the people ' s mandate .
the janata has given the mandate for certain policies .
how can we deviate from it ?
q . what will be your priorities as party chief ?
where do you fit in ?
a . ( laughs ) i am nobody ' s man .
i am a party man and will be guided by the party .
atalji , advaniji and the sangh will have a point of view .
so , how do we know that the hizbul - mujahideen is not talking to the union home secretary in srinagar only on orders from islamabad ?
how do we know the talks were not a ploy to distract attention while one of its murderous brother organisations massacred pilgrims on the amarnath yatra ?
frankly , why are we talking to those strange men if we refuse to talk to their commander - in - chief , general pervez musharraf ?
the general in islamabad is not an attractive man .
despite this to most indians he is the man who caused the kargil war and who is also a dictator .
a peace process involving pakistan is necessary and inevitable .
but the bureaucracy refuses to accept this .
and since we have a political leadership that is guided totally by babus they are being led into the usual traps .
only when he browsed through a chess database could he console himself with the fact that she had beaten five gms before him .
chess coach raghunandan gokhale points out that a gm title will be difficult and could take a while .
all india chess federation secretary p . t . ummer koya thinks viji should aim to be world champ in three years .
currently viji has an elo rating ( points by which chess players are graded ) of 2378 - - to be grandmaster she has to get to 2500 .
" this is the only game in which you have to compete with men to be among the world ' s best .
beating them is not impossible , " she says .
it happens all the time all over india .
why should it ?
perhaps , because we have allowed our servants to develop an inflated sense of their own importance by allowing them to think in vip terms .
perhaps because we are so used to living in third world , third - rate conditions , we expect no better .
or more probably because we have allowed government to abdicate its real responsibilities : its responsibilities to us .
which brings us to another disturbing aspect of what is happening in kashmir .
why could the yatris not have been protected ?
most estimates say we are dealing with no more than around 3,000 terrorists in kashmir .
what are our five lakh troops in the state doing ?
we should also disband our intelligence services for they are unable to provide us even the minimum intelligence on kashmir .
this reduces their contact with ordinary people to zero and this could , perhaps , explain why we seem to have no consistent policy on kashmir .
but the vajpayee government prides itself on its moves towards economic liberalisation , so why does it to cling to the worst habits of the past ?
you often hear politicians whine about the lack of popular support for liberalisation .
it will come when ordinary indians see a visible improvement in their physical environment .
so let us see the municipal commissioner clean up some of mumbai ' s other streets and this time for the people , not just for the prime minister .
do policies decide the players or vice versa ?
the abject failure of the public - sector disinvestment programme this year can almost entirely be attributed to this one fundamental confusion in the atal bihari vajpayee government .
every now and then a psu props up as the frontrunner for disinvestment .
soon , media reports follow about who is lobbying to get the company .
from ipcl to vsnl , a host of psus has been subjected to this treatment , and almost all have lost values in the stock market .
the root cause of the confusion is the absence of a uniform policy on disinvestments .
the recently announced scheme for dilution of government stake in maruti udyog exemplifies the confusion .
the fis are expected to offload the stake in favour of suzuki ( currently 50 per cent stakeholder ) and to the general public later .
besides being complicated the scheme begs some basic questions .
if the purpose is to increase suzuki ' s stake , why not sell it the equity directly ?
and if the government wants people to hold maruti shares , why not make a public offer ?
perhaps it hopes maruti will get some money to restructure itself and hike its value .
but that ' s unlikely in a market where competition is intensifying by the day .
that ' s true of all the 20 - odd psus on the block for disinvestment .
none would succeed if there is no clear and transparent policy on disinvestment .
even 10 years is not too late to draw up such a policy .
red roses &amp; red alert who ' s afraid of saint valentine ?
true , valentine ' s day . . . but valentine who ?
unfortunately , last week , the question was asked by the wrong people , in the wrong language .
in places like delhi , mumbai and kanpur , there was a blatant display of hate and paranoia in the name of culture endangered .
if so , the footsoldiers of shiv sena and hindu jagran manch are not upholding the culture of india but insulting it .
for india has already proved its national confidence by gamely withstanding every invasion , including cultural ones .
after all , globalisation is not economic alone .
a movie , a book - a cause is always there to activate the protester who has become such a socially disruptive bore .
why not start a kama deva ' s day ?
valentine may come and go , talking and selling love , but india does n ' t need a merchant to put a price tag on its culture .
i let my bat do the talking . "

many farmers did not even take out their produce from the cold storages , fearing that it would not even fetch the rs 80 storage charges .
saddled with potato stocks that nobody wanted , cold storage owners dumped the tuber on the roadsides and in open fields .
raj kumar from mehrai village in farrukhabad is one of those farmers who did n ' t pick up their crop because of the crash in potato prices .
of the 41,528 villages in rajasthan , 30,583 were declared scarcity - hit this year .
while productivity has dipped , the input costs have shot up .
" i have not been able to add even a brick to my property since 1991 , ' ' he says .
om prakash , who grows tomatoes on his three hectares in jaipur district in rajasthan , is in deeper waters .
his family had bought a tractor in 1997 after a good crop that year .
but iyer also inherits a host of problems that require all her acumen and energy to tackle in the 14 months she will be in office .
already there is much heartburn over the spate of recent postings in key positions , some long overdue .
for a while , jaswant singh toyed with the idea of appointing kanwar sibal , india ' s ambassador to france .
he was to move to delhi to ready himself for the post .
but sibal would have superseded at least a score of his seniors and the minister thought it wise not to cause such a massive upheaval .
eyebrows were raised when almost as an afterthought iyer was appointed .
the brows stayed up when the mea made a few other glaring rollbacks and postings .
what has happened though is that every vip has acquired a price on his head .
different countries have different approaches to hostage crises .
there is the american approach of an inflexible " no surrender " .
india takes the easiest option - - cringe and surrender .
yet enough is never enough ; every capitulation inspires a fresh abduction , preferably one with a political gloss .
the authority of the state is emasculated .
says abhijit sen , chairman of the committee on food supply management : " worse than low prices is the uncertainty the farmer is living in .
he does n ' t know what to grow , and if to grow . "
only such reforms must begin with what he calls the " de - stateisation " of agriculture .
for the crisis is almost entirely government engineered .
the threat worked .
the talks helped at least 12 mlas change their minds .
the reason : a " limited strategic understanding " with the trinamool that nath promised them .
nath recognises he ca n ' t force trinamool leader mamata banerjee to break away from the bjp .
" i do n ' t care about the nda .
i will hold formal talks with mamata , " he says .
" while we will have a pact with the trinamool , we will put up candidates against the bjp . "
according to him , the limited mahajot is imperative as there is no third front space in bengal .
accord is welcome - - but it can never flow from the barrel of a gun .
if verbosity alone could bring about change dhindsa would n ' t be a minister ; he ' d be a full - fledged revolutionary .
the vulnerabilities of the board of control for cricket in india ( bcci ) have never been a secret .
yet when it produces a completely banal and lifeless " vision statement " the minister scarcely admonishes it .
nor does he spell out a more rigorous alternative .
a copy of the final report was indeed saved .
and the reconstruction that many pakistanis - - and bangladeshis - - seek is exactly what the commission did .
it was in a sense , pakistan ' s truth commission .
the report has a bearing on general pervez musharraf ' s pakistan because it documents how political power corrupted and weakened the army .
it was this unwillingness of west pakistan to play by democratic rules that created a political crisis and precipitated a civil disobedience movement .
neither does his allegation that the balco deal will hurt tribals carry conviction .
indian socialism has long been a politician - contractor conspiracy - and the aboriginal people of chhattisgarh have been among its principal victims .
in theory , the congress is committed to privatisation .
as an opposition party it is , of course , entitled to raise charges of cronyism .
the comic villainy of an ajit is not unknown in popular indian tradition .
even so , the economy would be better served if farce did not repeat itself as tragedy .
unfortunately , the medicine it has prescribed will only make the patient - in this case , india ' s anyway comatose higher educational system - feel worse .
since populist measures have a domino effect , there is the fear that other colleges and universities will adopt du ' s idea .
the quality of education in the majority of india ' s public - funded institutions is hardly credible .
the teaching profession rarely attracts the best students .
the balance between meritocracy and social obligations to the traditionally disadvantaged is a delicate one .
after all , du ' s primary objective should be to provide education , not fill job quotas .
in an act of deference , she said she would n ' t field candidates against chowdhury ' s brother and sister , abu hasnat and ruby noor .
" he ' s a hardcore congressman who wo n ' t change his colours , " says an optimistic colleague .
in the present scenario , its not a credential that matters .
q . why did n ' t you resign when the news of the charges first broke out ?
q . so what finally made you decide to resign ?
yes .
by implementing , or at least trying to put in place , administrative reforms that would have made government functioning more transparent .
there are hundreds of convoluted rules and procedures that need to be junked , hundreds of departments that need no longer exist .
as long as it takes an average of 20 years for a case to come to court , we can be sure corruption will continue to flourish .
the slow judicial process is the main reason why corrupt officials and politicians simply disappear instead of being publicly brought to justice .
the fact that we are still waiting for justice in the bofors case , nearly 15 years on , speaks for itself .
so what happens now ?
well , the congress , as the main opposition party , will try and ensure that the functioning of parliament and government becomes impossible .
maybe not , not yet .
it ' s the stench of the rotten cadavers of powerlust .
relax reality tv , welcome raw reality .
standing stained is the socialist - once a streetfighting romantic whose brand equity equalled that of a coke bottle .
today his national value is fixed by his partner - the pornography of socialism ?
then fixers without even the fig leaves of defence .
is india ' s most popular politician distancing himself from popular sentiment ?
fattened , corrupted and brutalised by power , the army just was n ' t in any position to take on the indian army in adverse circumstances .
put to the test , its grandiose strategic doctrine - - " the defence of east pakistan rests in west pakistan " - - crumbled .
it was aimed at establishing a quasi - federal system that would see the tamil - dominated north and east regions merge and gain administrative autonomy .
though well short of demands of the militant liberation tigers of tamil eelam ( ltte ) , it was still a big step .
perhaps power makes the journey from the exceptional to the banal much easier .
take a return trip to the coronation day to realise the pathology of the present .
then it was the most defining turn in indian politics - the right turn , politically as well as literally .
it was a popular repudiation of the manufactured demonology of hindu nationalism , and it was a massive protest against the culture of congressism .
a moment for the unfairly caricatured nationalist to step out of wall calendar mythology , to occupy the vital centre of indian politics .
but power is an indifferent leveller .
it makes morality a dirty deed .
well , moral politics can easily turn into a celebration of schmaltzy sociology .
the bjp had the advantage of inexperience - or innocence .
he cannot say the system corrupts .
the mandate was for correcting the system .
q . what have you got against the balco deal ?
a . the absolute lack of transparency , underhand deals , corruption and undervaluation of the property .
three , legal and constitutional rights of tribals are being trampled upon .
q . how serious is your offer to buy out sterlite ? and why was the offer made so late ?
a . we have collected the money and are also putting the offer in a formal petition to the supreme court .
i had asked arun shourie to give me 24 hours to find a new buyer but they hurried the deal .
a . why should i , just because the union government has made an illegal deal ?
a . simply because someone has made the centre happy by bribing does it become a strategic partner ?
workers will run balco if chhattisgarh is allowed to buy it .
q . your allegations against the pmo are still unsubstantiated .
there is a classy casualness about everything on him , be it the hermes tie or the patek philippe watch .
and that despite his name figuring nowhere in the tehelka tapes .
at the press conference , singh was evidently proxying for mishra on economic issues , of which he ( singh ) is in charge at the pmo .
now the archaeological survey of india ( asi ) is attempting to restore the mehtab bagh to its horticultural grandeur , almost as shahjahan saw it .
in the process , many myths are being cleared .
mehtab bagh was also rumoured to be the proposed site for the taj ' s black marble twin that shahjahan wanted as his mausoleum .
finally , the asi decided to pick up the shovel in 1994 .
he may be " rewarded " with a rajya sabha nomination .
in more ways than one , the jury is out on george .
i encountered the phenomenon of bollywood when we began the tour in mumbai .
amidst raucous cheers by the opposition backbenchers , he informed the house that the government was putting on hold the debate on the new constitution .
with parliament ' s term ending on august 24 and fresh elections to be held in the coming months , the withdrawal is a major setback for the pa .
kumaratunga herself narrowly regained the presidency late last year after a bitter battle with unp chief ranil wickremasinghe .
with the clergy also losing confidence , kumaratunga finds herself in a tight corner .
though the lankan army has fought back and halted the ltte ' s march towards jaffna , the situation remains tense .
now the withdrawal of the bill makes her task of regaining political control an uphill one .
the " goddess " has a new resting place and new companions .
( john buchanan is the coach of the current australian cricket team . )
what followed was a flood of charges and counter - charges about lobbying and saffronisation of the awards .
were the nation ' s highest film awards " rigged " ?
was the selection process " questionable " ?
do the winners have any reason to celebrate ?
the drama unfolded during the jury ' s final round of deliberations on march 26 in delhi .
the national film awards have never been short of controversy .
last year , controversy surfaced again over the decision to give the best actress award to kiron kher for the film bariwali .
it was later alleged that her dialogues in bengali were dubbed by tv actress reeta kayral and had not even been acknowledged .
" why was there no protest then ? " asks swaraj .
many in the industry feel the uproar was long overdue .
says one member : " forget seeing films in their entirety , some members even cast their votes without attending all screenings . "
it was a well - orchestrated move to advance their personal interests . "
but the debate is certain to continue till the time president k . r . narayanan gives away the awards .
that ' s a remarkable reflection of the error in judgement by most fund managers who have been the custodians of an increasingly large share of public money .
in the past few years investments in mutual funds have soared .
between april 2000 and february 2001 , private - sector mutual funds alone managed to collect rs 17,000 crore .
more than the analysts or the media or even the brokers , it is the regulator that investors are most disappointed with .
the share price of cyberspace flared up to rs 1,900 , before plummeting to rs 18.45 in march .
beyond the angers and frustration , the crash has also made small investors see some sense .
nobody now believes that stock price do n ' t matter when you are buying shares in a technology company .
not to mention how dangerous it can be to pay a high price for shares of companies with big claims and but little else .
that such devastation happened in the markets despite several measures to improve efficiency and transparency is ominous .
in the past when shares used to be delivered physically , there were problems of forged certificates .
that was eliminated with the advent of demat ( paperless ) trading .
the teacher bought a bagful of primers for his " student " from the recently concluded bengali book fair in the capital .
q . increased groupism in your party appears to be affecting your chances in the coming assembly elections .

besides , groupism has always been there in the congress .
q . k . karunakaran , the former chief minister , feels his group is being ignored .
it was the first time charu sharma was taking her fivemonth - old baby girl anoushka for a ride in her new pram .
sharma politely acknowledged the warning , but noticing that the park was crowded with children , continued her walk .
when i realised it was a monkey i screamed and tried to pull it away .
but it would not budge .
only when i dug my nails into its head did it finally leave my baby . "
not before the damage was done .
sharma is still in a state of shock - she now refuses to take her baby out anywhere in the open .
the violent monkey , on the other hand , could be out on the prowl looking for another victim .
in noida , a little further away , monkeys are now attacking humans in predatory packs .
" the problem is the government does n ' t want to do anything .
it is waiting for ngos to solve the problem , " says menon .
but the authorities , in their own feeble way , have made an unconventional effort - of getting a langur to drive away the rhesus .
at nirman bhavan , a government building near the rashtrapati bhavan beleaguered by the rhesus threat , a langur on a leash threatens away its more troublesome cousin .
and time is running out for the capital ' s distressed populace .
b . p . mishra , chairman , new delhi municipal corporation , is clear : " the only solution is to cull them . "

q . is it true that america plays an important role in your country ?
a . america has given a lot of money - $ 4.5 billion - and f - 16 aircraft .
q . so you ' ve put democracy on lease for money ?
a . when did we want to put democracy on a lease ?
there were strategic concerns .
you ask those who did that .
q . in your first term as prime minister , you were progressive .
in your second term , you wanted to earn wealth .
delhi : it is not unusual for congress leaders close to sonia gandhi to disguise their wishes as her diktat .
facing corruption charges back home , wahid ' s fate as president currently hangs in the balance .
he was personally invited to india by prime minister a . b . vajpayee when he visited jakarta in february .
it is doubtful if vajpayee can return wahid ' s hospitality as his official guest .
last week , it was the itc digital film festival that she was invited to inaugurate .
she waxed eloquent on the merits of digital movies .
but it was soon evident that sushma does n ' t appreciate all that she preaches .
mumbai : politicos are finally waking up to the power of the worldwide web to fire cyber salvos at their political opponents .
two decades ago , he was considered infallible as leader of the anti - foreigner uprising in assam .
yet , prafulla kumar mahanta , 49 , is the asom gana parishad ' s ( agp ' s ) best bet .
not because he has taken the agp from strength to strength but because he is the regional party ' s undisputed leader , having sidelined all potential rivals .
the son of a schoolteacher , mahanta has transformed himself from a successful student leader to a politician with tremendous staying power .
his government was dismissed in november 1990 as ulfa rebels wreaked havoc in the state , killing , kidnapping and serving extortion notices on tea planters .
then the agp lost the 1991 polls .
mahanta survived an assassination bid by the ulfa but not the stigma of the rs 200 - crore veterinary scam .
now , by tying up with the bjp , he could have ensured her a central ministerial berth .
on his part , assam congress president tarun gogoi is used to political families , having grown under the patronage of the nehru - gandhi clan .
nugas is owned by businessman ramesh handa , who makes no secret of his friendship with the gandhi family .
the opposition bjp leaders also joined the fray : lok sabha member madan lal khurana alleged a collusion between the delhi government and nugas .
suspicions of a deal between the delhi government and nugas have been floating around for a while .
the company has subsequently moved the supreme court .
rfat acquired the pilot project for the conversion of two buses with its third generation ( distributor - less ignition system ) technology .
handa is charged with using his connections in the congress to influence the delhi government .
the price : nearly rs 5 lakh per kit .
with the present congress - ncp government in the grip of an acute financial crisis , the project continues to remain paper - bound .
as does another rs 350 - crore plan to restore some of the 234 protected monuments in the state .
cultural department officials say the task at hand is gigantic .
says chain kanwar , 85 , who has played dress - up more than a few times : " it ' s more fun and informal . "
a sentiment not always echoed by the city ' s menfolk .
locals who organise the festival through public contribution pamper the women with treats of lemon drinks , fruits and ice cream .
says ashok soni , 36 : " in my younger days i was proud of being hit . "
perhaps because tradition has it that a bachelor hit during the evening is ensured matrimony with the woman of his dreams .
along with the fun , it is also a time for prayers .
combat zone pyrdiwah : in east khasi hill district of meghalaya . it is an enclave claimed by bangladesh but in india ' s control .
boraibari : in kurigram district of bangladesh bordering assam . it is a slushy enclave claimed by india but under dhaka ' s control .
dy commandant b . r . mondol : cut injury on neck and cheek .
was probably killed a day after capture .
sub - inspector panna lal : bullet injury on left arm .
vertical knife cut mark on forehead .
head constable raman gouda : cut injury on head and right arm , cut injuries on right leg .
constable mafiuddin : four cut marks on body .
constable gurbax singh : cut injury on right temporal region and arm by sharp object .
constable s . dhala : bullet injuries on chest / arm .
india and bangladesh share 4,096 km of border based on a dividing line drawn by sir cyril radcliffe during partition .
only 6.5 km are yet to be demarcated .
the crux of the problem , however , are 161 enclaves in each other ' s territory that continue to be disputed .
india claims 111 enclaves spread over 17,000 acres that fall in bangladesh territory .
bangladesh ' s 50 such enclaves are spread over 10,000 acres in indian territory .
" we ca n ' t do magic .
millions of people in the border areas need to feel safe again .
it will take time , " he said .
speculation that the clash has been motivated by either the pakistani isi or the indian raw has been touted in some circles but has not gained credence .
nor has the argument that slogans supporting opposition leader khaleda zia were found conveniently placed alongside the dead indians in boraibari .
" if that indeed were the case , then the indians themselves planted it , " says a garment factory owner in dhaka .
" why would zia ' s followers or the isi leave a calling card ? " he asks .
the ruling party ' s efforts to whip up anger against the jamaat - i - islami and other rightist parties have not made much headway .
fortunately for hasina , despite the internal strife , economic growth has not flagged .
bumper crops in 1999 and 2000 have boosted the agriculture sector while the exports , manufacturing and revenue sectors have also done well .
hasina ' s tactic has been to bait zia on the subject of elections , but to remain unfazed by the strikes and shutdowns .
rs 35,000 for overstaying in his official residence .
what an interesting lesson in why india remains a poor and backward country the prime minister and the leader of the opposition treated us to last week .
then it was vajpayee ' s turn to take things personally .
businessmen representing textile and sugar mills were also present and vajpayee and sonia could have learned how to have a dialogue without fighting .
it is they who suffer most due to unthinking , insensitive laws and policies .
it is the plight of these people that our two most important leaders should be worrying about , not their own pathetic ego problems .
the report has suggested that artillery should be included in the general cadre on an experimental basis till 2005 .
the rules are such that he ca n ' t go back to artillery branch .
general shankar roy choudhary , rajya sabha member and former army chief , says that he is all in favour of artillery being included in the general cadre .
the secretariat will only lay down the qualitative requirements .
the best man for the job appears to be the yardstick .
there are major changes in the dress code too .
the joshi committee has recommended that there should be one uniform for brigadiers and above .
currently , the colours of the lanyard , cap and belt of any officer show regimental affiliations .
general joshi ' s study has also advocated restructuring of the intelligence corps .
according to the report , there should be an intelligence battalion at the corps level and another at the command level .
the central army commander is in favour of increasing the entry of women officers into branches such as air defence artillery , aviation and intelligence .
this last may be the least contentious issue .
for the rest , the recommendations will have to battle entrenched opinion before they can become rules .
the nun promptly returns the greeting but is surprised to see the crowd of unusual visitors accompanying the vicar .
the father smilingly requests the nun to call the other inmates .
" the vicar ' s candidature proves our commitment to the minorities , " says pinarayi vijayan , the cpi ( m ) state secretary .
though he has steered clear of overt politics , nooranal is no novice to public life .
founder of many educational institutions in tribal bathery , he has been the president of the local cooperative bank for 40 years .
" in the past , we could never ally with the communists as they were anti - religion and anti - god .
but today they have changed and are on church and temple committees , " says nooranal .
the resultant furore led to several church groups openly dissociating themselves from the statement .
it ' s may day .
a blue tata sumo drives to the bjp ' s campaign headquarters in dibrugarh town shortly after 8.30 p . m .
suddenly , all hell breaks loose .
the three are greeted by a volley of shots fired by some militants waiting with 9 - mm pistols .
the trio are rushed to the assam medical college &amp; hospital nearby , but are declared " brought dead " .
ouch , that must have hurt more .
that ' s one way of getting noticed .
another is happening soon : sushama reddy , sister of voluble veejay meghana reddy , has been signed up by channel v to do some veejaying herself .
looks like she ' s got this too .
indian filmdom has never looked approvingly at just - married actresses , a fact highlighted in the unfortunate case of tamil star devyani .
devyani is unfazed : " good actresses are always in demand .
the film will be released in 2001 . . . and abraham is pretty sure he ' ll survive as a model till then .
an interesting set of statistics has emerged from the opinion poll on the assembly elections published in this magazine last week .
in supposedly modern kerala , 53 per cent said it had remained unchanged and 23 per cent said it had worsened .
yet , if you were voting in tamil nadu would you really choose someone who proudly goes by the name of stalin ?
yet , just travel around bengal , ruled for more than 20 years by the marxists , and all you see is the most wretched poverty .
is that not strange ?
surely , a political party so totally dedicated to the poor should have succeeded in eliminating poverty by now ?
how do you manage to do it day after day ? "
who cares , frankly , and who cares who wins in the desert that our political landscape has become .
the second college to be set up by the british in india , presidency college , chennai , looks every inch a heritage institution .
the " mother of madras university " is no . 1 in science education in the india today rankings for the second year in a row .
age is beginning to tell on its 160year - old building , but its academic excellence is unwithered .
the science departments were a hub of quality research during the time c . v . raman studied here .
says principal dr t . r . balakrishnan : " on an average , the college produces 50 phds a year . "
not surprising when 200 out of 250 faculty members are phd holders .
the question that is now preoccupying the dissidents is : who will be the sacrificial lamb in october ?
heading the list is pranab mukherjee who is said to have found inspiration after two meetings with former prime minister p . v . narasimha rao .
if it ' s not him , it could be prasada .
and if neither muster the courage , the mantle may fall once again on the white chiffon - clad begum of rampur .
" i ' m a born fighter , " she says , unfazed by what she sees is a momentary setback .
naidu called a meeting in delhi last week of chief ministers of states that will lose money if the efc ' s proposals become a reality .
the national environment engineering research institute ( neeri ) suggested that 25 pollution - mitigating plant species be planted every two metres in the proposed green belt .
the asi cried foul , arguing that the plan would result in a chaotic jungle replacing the thoughtfully planned bagh .
the garden should only have plants that the mughals used in their gardens , it pleaded .
the supreme court agreed , but directed the neeri and the asi to agree on a common list of plants .
naidu though , belongs to a new breed of indian politician .
he may not be an economist but he is street smart enough to pay attention to changes taking place in the world .
he realised that he needed professional help to articulate a new idea for andhra .

but most indians only realise they may have heart problems when the disease has developed to full blown clogged arteries .
at that stage one in every five patients dies , no matter how good the treatment .
for early detection of the actual disease , angiography is considered the " golden standard . "
but this test is expensive ( rs 14,000 ) and invasive , carrying a 1 in 10,000 chance of mortality .
with this technique heart problems can be detected at a very early stage .

this is some subcontinental brotherhood . really ?
come to the subtext and read the motives .
true , at the outset the grand gesture of vajpayee has the makings of statesmanship , and this subcontinent badly needs some amount of it .
a crisis of confidence , not - so - happy assembly election results , cracks in the image - the vajpayee mystique was in need of some repair .
and the general has not yet passed the trust test , despite the belated brave words against the jehadis .
he is , after all , the same man who responded to vajpayee ' s lahore journey by initiating kargil .
yet to actively encourage small families to the point of virtually outlawing the alternative is an alarming action .
it is only non - democracies like china that have such rules .

" i learned to absorb and keep quiet .
i had to take decisions , an extremely heavy burden i could n ' t share with anyone .
but i do believe that sometimes it ' s good to share because otherwise you feel so alone .

this is i ' m - the - message - and - i ' m - the - medium megalomania . the leader as the keeper of mass conscience .
for jayalalitha , the masses are there .
today , jayalalitha has taken the idea of the supreme leader to the summit of paranoia .
at first glance it is life as usual in chathe sekhwan , a village in sangrur district in the heart of punjab ' s malwa region .
they are a defiant lot with scant respect not just for their ages but also tradition : their dance has always been performed by female dancers .
the mardan da giddha - the male giddha - has survived extinction in the village despite the fast - paced bhangra ' s overweening popularity .
" it is a hereditary gift , " says the frail - looking lal singh , the head drummer .
the origin of the giddha can be traced to a form of entertainment during weddings centuries earlier .
traditionally it comprised the male - specific tandav , the female lasayam and the mixed steps of jugal .
as marriages turned into short , day - time affairs , the cultural raison d ' etre of the male giddha vanished ; only the female version endured .
chathe sekhwan , however , never gave up the mardan da giddha and it was performed during village fairs .
for the farmers who toiled all day , it was a great way to unwind .
in a way , the british too helped revive the dance .
it was not uncommon during the british raj for able - bodied youngsters fearing forced recruitment into the army to run away from home .
once on the road they had to do something to keep themselves occupied .
the mardan da giddha was a popular option .
official apathy emboldened the thieves to strike again .
this time the robbers injected sedatives to immobilise the two watchmen before they took away three more ornate pillars and a lotus medallion in a daring daylight heist .

most of these have bright coloured flowers that would shine in the moonlight .
the herbage is also being arranged in order of its height . tall trees are followed by shorter ones , followed by shrubs and finally small flowering plants .
also , the gardeners assisting singh in nursing the young garden are constantly weeding out the weaker species .
" plants not suited to the sandy soil are being constantly replaced , " says gardener rishi prakash .
" the garden is a mixture of what looks nice and what sustains . "
the origins of the mehtab bagh are a matter of much speculation .
there is also a reference to the garden in a letter written to shahjahan by aurangzeb while he was on his way to the deccan .
the concept of a riverside garden was essentially a mughal idea , probably brought to india from central asia .
the bulk of these have come from us think tanks or from pakistan .
during the early phases of the kargil war , india ' s military intelligence was seriously handicapped by the absence of personnel with an adequate command over pushto dialects .
the school of international studies , a premier institute in delhi , is still awaiting an iran expert .
it ' s not that our collective awareness of the region was always so feeble .
what is referred to as the great game was n ' t played from whitehall , as is often believed .
it was planned and executed by the foreign department of the government of india in calcutta and delhi .
the players also included indians like mohan lal and sarat chandra das , well - versed in local customs and languages .
by proceeding on the assumption that indian foreign policy began in 1947 , india turned its back on an institutionalised awareness of the region .
yet , so short is public memory that we have forgotten what india was like before the reform process began .
this makes the government so nervous of change that much of the economy continues to remain unreformed .
the power sector , for instance , remains much as it has always been .
the problem , though , is bigger still .
the command , which will be headed by the three - services in rotation , will function under the to - be - appointed chief of defence staff .
although envisaged as a maritime surveillance command , its significance lies in its location .
the island territories sit at the mouth of the malacca straits , which is the second - busiest sea lane of communication ( sloc ) in the world .
most of the ships approach the straits through the 10 degree channel , which bisects the andaman islands and the great nicobar islands .
indira point , the southernmost tip of india , is actually separated by the great channel from indonesia ' s strife - torn banda aceh territory .
this means that by setting up the anc , india will now have the capacity to protect and monitor sea traffic bound for the south china sea .
" it is a facility to extend india ' s reconnaissance and surveillance reach , " he says .
according to the indian plans , the first anc commander will be a vice - admiral from naval headquarters .
he will be assisted by a two - star officer from the army , who will function as the chief of staff to the anc .
it is also flying surveillance missions using the il - 38s and the dornier maritime surveillance aircraft from its airport at campbell bay in the nicobar islands .
the length of the runways at the port blair and the car nicobar airports have been increased to allow fighter operations .
it is learnt that fighter practice " runs " will take place as soon as the anc commander is appointed by the government .
the anc command will also have additional land forces .
for bjp in power was a momentous turn - and the first right turn - in indian politics .
as a responsible , nationally conscious party on the right , the elected had the mandate to herald the new .
but power seems to be a great leveller , particularly in this country .
it is losing on ideology as well as ideas .
and it is ideas , more than ideology , that drive politics in this age - the so - called vision thing from the leader .
it should not have happened so soon .
it ' s a rs 1,50,000 crore fear .
is the collapse of the uti ' s us - 64 a precursor to a bigger bloodbath in india ' s financial system ?
more than a fifth of its loans are non - performing assets ( npas ) , i . e . they are not recoverable .
that ' s the smallest of the big three financial institutions ( fis ) .
the industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) has npas of over rs 8,000 crore and its profits have been declining for three consecutive years .
icici is in a better shape , but its profits took a knocking in 2000 - 01 .
the combined asset and liabilities of these institutions exceed rs 1,50,000 crore .
and within the bjp , there is no doubt about the heir apparent .
unlike vajpayee who was from the party but also above it , the 74 - year - old home minister advani has always been a bjp and rss favourite .
the man who recreated the bjp from the debris of the 1984 election , advani is respected for his personal integrity , clarity and strategic acumen .
his reputation as a hindutva hardliner - a product of his controversial rath yatra in 1990 - ruled him out as the leader of a coalition in 1996 .
since then , however , he has sought to reinvent himself in a more acceptable garb .
as the foremost pointman of the vajpayee government , he enjoys a personal rapport with the leaders of coalition partners .
consequently , his elevation to the top job may be less complicated than his reputation suggests .
they will guarantee a troubled succession .

with time , the elephants will even allow their trainers to ride them .
while riding an elephant , mahouts manoeuvre by pressing their toes into the animal , especially to indicate direction .
often , while tracking an animal in the wild , toe commands are more effective - and quieter - than verbal commands .
to give the orphans some semblance of a family , the captive elephants are kept close to each other .
all this takes money but sinha and the others are not complaining .
in fact , the upkeep of each elephant comes to around rs 1 lakh every year .
the elephants polish off about 300 kg of green fodder , and sometimes tender banana shoots as a rare treat .
as sinha points out , it ' s a solid investment for the future . a future both for the animals and for nature . metroscape
but it is easier said than done .
last week , within days of the order being issued , she wrote to all chief ministers seeking their support to protect the rights of the states .
the rule , however , has a proviso which says that " in case of any disagreement , the matter shall be decided by the central government " .
much to its surprise , jayalalitha not only brushed the request aside but turned it into a subject for a political propaganda blitzkrieg .
" a reply to the central government will be sent soon , " she remarked with characteristic imperiousness after shooting off letters to other chief ministers .
kaushal was speaking on behalf of the nagas against limiting the cease - fire to nagaland under pressure from manipur .
the naga insurgency problem lay not in nagaland but in the hill districts of manipur .
there could not be a cease - fire with the ultra group if there was no cease - fire in manipur , he argued .
kaushal is no ordinary member of parliament .
the former mizoram governor went on to share a secret with the members .
during his negotiations , not once did the nscn ( i - m ) raise the demand for greater nagaland , kaushal said .
he debunked the popular misgivings about the concept of nagalim .
" greater nagaland is not an antinational demand .
it may be wrong but it is certainly not antinational .
and this spell might last for decades .
the requisition issue is knottier than what the central leadership thinks .
the subtext of the rule says that " concurrence " with the state governments is necessary .
in this case , there is no evidence of a prior consultation with the state government .
former dgp v . r . lakshmi narayan says that " the three officers will be well within their rights to go to court against the requisition order " .
a nod from the state government is still necessary .
however , in rammohan ' s case , there were hardly a ripple because the assam government chose not to object to the centre ' s decision .
thus there was no " disagreement " as mentioned in the proviso to the rule .
the union government was obviously emboldened by a strong view in the central bureaucracy that delhi should have the last word on requisitioning members of all - india services .
however , the centre ' s power to override the states ' opposition to recalling officers still remains a grey area in the law .
nor are the state governments likely to accept a transgression of their rights without resistance .
the intelligence bureau , for example , reported as many as 65 such vacancies last year .
the tamil nadu case obviously sets a precedent that states may not welcome .
earlier , when the aiadmk was in the vajpayee - led coalition , it was jayalalitha who had demanded that the then karunanidhi government be sacked .
she took her revenge by pulling down the nda government .
with the bill of coalition soaring , it is no wonder that a much harassed prime minister last week threatened to call it quits .

q . what is the present status of the trinamool - congress alliance ?
after the elections mamata banerjee declared that she ' d like to go it alone .
if the majority partner says it would go it alone the alliance naturally cannot exist .
q . will the congress try to woo mamata back ?
a . the congress ca n ' t have any truck with a political outfit that associates with a communal party .
the alliance was possible only after mamata quit the nda .
q . did she formally quit nda ?
a . she wrote a letter saying her party members leaving the council of ministers would " strengthen the hands of atal bihari vajpayee " .
i do n ' t know what it means .
q . which party has gained from the alliance ?
a . in 1996 , the undivided congress got 81 seats .
this year , the alliance got 96 , including trinamool ' s 60 and our 26 .
so both parties have gained .
q . what is the future of non - left parties in the state ?
a . much depends on mamata .
if she distances herself from the bjp we ' d like to go with her , even as a minor partner .

the share warrants issued to the ambanis in december 1992 were actually allotted to them in 1994 .
reliance dubs this argument as misconceived .
the october 1994 investment of uti in ril shares totalled rs 773 crore .
q . why did uti buy ril shares through private placement and not from the market ?
because open market purchase would have made the acquisition costlier .
uti had launched around half - a - dozen new schemes in 1993 and 1994 .
obviously , these funds had to be invested .
apart from ril , uti bought shares of eight other companies through private placements in 1994 .
returns on most of these investments , other than in hdfc , have been negative .
all private placements done after august 1994 had lock - in periods .
q . did the investment in reliance shares turn us - 64 scheme into an equity fund ?

post - agra , such a view from the losers is quite possible .
has india become rather stoic ?
part of the problem is india ' s national character .
security is more of a concept here , preserved mostly in committees and documents .
a nation on permanent vigil is certainly not an indian trait .
after all , india is not israel , though the two countries continue to have something in common : the presence of a never - sleeping enemy .
israel has the resolve and no remorse , india has only words , that too very incident - specific .
so after every doda , there are wake - up calls and high - powered meetings .
after the initial bouts of anguish , it is back to the smugness - till the next doda , or something deadlier .
where is the long - term kashmir policy , a policy rooted in a genuine sense of national security ?
the danger is clear and present and it is testing the national will , but the indian resistance is passive .
india has weapons but no vision .
the point has registered well with officials .
says bihar police association president k . k . jha : " bihar ' s administrative system does not allow the proper functioning of the police force .
perhaps this is the reason he has adopted the new style of communicating with the police and public . "
it worked .
" if a police officer will not use brave words , who will ? " he asks .
this is the man who dares to openly rebuke the dreaded dons saying the police would not intervene if the people exacted revenge from them .
he is also the man who exhorts his officials to change the force ' s image .
" that ' s the only way to undo the damage done by the sun tv footage , " says an aiadmk leader .
but the censor board has had the last word .
no box - office hit here .
" this must be some sort of a record congress history - two general secretaries involved in a murderous assault .
this has not happened even in bihar , " he told journalists .
in dravida - nadu it is a permanent show of the underdog versus the top dog - bathetic and violent .
in the beginning , however , the show had a thematic coherence , the enemy was the brahmin or hindi or the north .
today , the enemy is not an outsider , and is defined by three extra alphabets or the absence of them : dmk versus aiadmk .
and both parties want to stand on the moral highground , preferably with some partisan support from delhi .
to get that support , the underdog may have to take off his shirt in the house of people .
he has lost the election miserably and now the winner wants to ensure that he loses his dignity as well .
the future of ia ' s subsidiary , alliance air , also hangs in balance .
undaunted by the mess , yadav claims that he will " bring the airlines to a no - profit - no - loss state " .
what he forgets to add is suspension of a - i managing director in may this year without any replacement so far .
that ' s at a time when competitors are resorting to every trick to eat away the remaining market of a - i .
with a minister as clueless as yadav , there is no hope of an early take - off for india ' s civil aviation .
he is a walking advertisement for the belief that india can well do without the burden of state - owned national airlines .

you must believe that you are going to sydney to create history by winning the ninth gold medal .
this time in sydney , gift him with gold because he has shown such faith in all of you .
the project is daunting but it does not help for the minister to pretend that change is unnecessary .
he is trying every way to create political support for privatisation .
but jatiya is doing nothing .
nor has he done anything to remove the perception .
attempts over three weeks to reach the minister drew a blank .
given jatiya ' s resistance to reforms there are only two ways to move ahead : force the issue or bypass the ministry .
both are being attempted .
he chose rural development over other ministries that were offered .
it has the second - largest share of funds in the central budget , next only to defence .
such largesse comes with little accountability because it is states that spend the money .
allocated funds are not always utilised .
in many schemes , expenditure is less than 30 per cent of the allocation .
in 2000 - 1 bihar spent 0.80 per cent of the funds allocated under a rural water supply scheme .
of rs 2,500 crore the ministry got from the road development fund in 2000 - 1 , not even 10 per cent has yet been spent .
the quality of spending is even more dubious .
if every company takes up development projects , we can change the face of rural india . "
naidu ' s radical proposal is to divest the government ' s stakes in psus and invest the proceeds in rural development .
" that will not only subdue opposition to disinvestment , it will also generate funds for rural development outside the budget . "
a good idea , regardless of whether it is dubbed the excitement of an innocent or the lofty promise of a seasoned politician .
the chargesheet of inefficiency against this ministry runs into reams .
yet arun jaitley is one person who even the most despondent expects a lot from .

recently , finance minister yashwant sinha found himself invited to a function to honour reliance industries chief dhirubhai ambani in mumbai .
he had a ready excuse for missing it : the function clashed with a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs ( ccea ) .

the pmo cancelled the ccea meeting .
a surly sinha got the message and travelled to mumbai where he made off - the - cuff remarks on business ethics .

it is with growing fascination that i have watched the debate on the " saffronisation of education " currently underway in our political class and our newspapers .
we are watching .
we will not allow the government to get away with any sleight of hand . "
murli manohar joshi is a lousy education minister .
that is our real problem .
so the changes he has sought to bring are superficial and silly .
but then he is not really the education minister since this most vital of ministries does not exist in the vajpayee cabinet .
the result also is that it is easier for indians to study india ' s culture and civilisation in some american university than in india .

chhattisgarh wants amarkantak . madhya pradesh will not let go .
and the speakers of the state assemblies of both the congress - ruled states are playing advocates for their own sectarian considerations .
as the two state tussle over amarkantak , an unlikely outcome could be the complicating of the narmada dam muddle .
amarkantak is the source of the narmada and the sone .
both the rivers trickle out as springs from the rocky vindhyas .
when madhya pradesh was bifurcated , nobody thought of adding amarkantak to chhattisgarh .
also at stake , besides the narmada , are the priceless coal and bauxite deposits .
south eastern coalfields limited has its best mines in chhattisgarh in the belt stretching from shahdol to chirmiri .
the bauxite deposits in the vindhya ranges are only partly exploited .
smelters in balco , korba , are expected to get most of their future supplies from the surguja and shahdol regions in chhattisgarh .
amarkantak is a small pilgrim centre with a population of 3,000 people .
its economy is dependent on chhattisgarh whose borders are less than 7 km away by road .
pendra , the nearest railway station , is less than 40 km away .
this may begin to ruin the fragile economy of the place .
the condition of roads in chhattisgarh is slightly better , so is the power infrastructure .

but my job is to ensure level playing fields for every player irrespective of the name tag they carry .
q . do you agree with a general perception that ram vilas paswan has been shifted because of pressure from the business lobby ?
a . no .
the prime minister was always in favour of merging telecom with information technology .
instead of taking information technology away from me , he assigned telecom to me as well .
q . does it mean that you are now the prime minister ' s opening bowler against his opponents both within the party and outside it ?
or , like that islamic cab driver in salman rushdie ' s fury , cursing the blasphemer in the marketplace , " hey !
american man !
you are a godless homosexual rapist of your grandmother ' s pet goat . "
and anti - americanism , more specific than anti - imperialism , badly needed a new kremlin .
it could not have been pyongyang .
it does n ' t have a centre , it does n ' t have a helmsman .
in basu ' s case , his tongue has an immediate reason to slip so savagely .
mauled by mamata banerjee , reported by george fernandes , he seems to have lost his linguistic equilibrium .
still , it is not the way to talk politics , comrade , it is not the way to talk back , no matter how besieged you are .
now , it seems , what remains of their importance is purely verbal : bad language .
the reaction came . thankfully , for once , the babus in the south block did not bury the country ' s response in the red tape of obscurity .
note , for instance , the patently absurd arguments being constructed to limit india ' s cooperation with the us in the war against terrorism .
this argument is devoid of any merit .
non - alignment was not a straitjacket that was intended to force india to maintain an artificial balance .
it was a policy designed in the cold war years to help india avoid being trapped in the rivalry between the two blocs .
non - alignment was not a dogma that was intended to force the country to sacrifice its legitimate interests on the altar of a shibboleth .
consider this .
for the past decade , india has been fighting a lonely battle against terrorism , especially of the kind produced by religious extremists in the region .
more indians have died in acts of terrorism than in all the wars fought with pakistan and china .
for years now , delhi has been attempting to get the international community to become more sensitive and responsive to the dangers posed by terrorism .
it should not cause complacence . "
admittedly , america could have reacted to india ' s offer of cooperation with greater dispatch , but partnerships are not built on phone calls .
a convergence of strategic interests gets nations together , not tactical manoeuvres intended to serve a specific purpose .
at 83 kg , vajpayee is overweight .
osteoarthritis has no cure .
treatment is limited to relieving the pain .
knee - replacement surgery , as in vajpayee ' s case , is usually the last resort .
the cartilage is removed and replaced with an artificial knee .
called a prosthesis , it is made of metal and plastic .
two metal pieces are fitted into the thigh and shin bones , with a plastic plate acting as a bearing between them .
the prosthesis either fits into the bone or is " cemented " by a substance called polymethymethyacrylate .
after the surgery , rigorous physiotherapy prevents stiffness in the knee joint .
recovery takes between four and six weeks .
a urine sample showed infection , which again could spell fever .
there his condition deteriorated and nine days after he was admitted , he died at the icu while on a respirator .
the mis - diagnosis lies in the fact that apollo failed to do a bone marrow test .
international protocol for unexplained fever categorically demands a bone - marrow examination .
aml is a life - threatening disease in which cancer cells start proliferating in the bone marrow and then spill over into the blood stream .
the asi ' s decision to keep mehtab bagh off limits for tourists ( and plastic bottles ) is laudable .
if only it could remain like that forever .
they are both lawyers from karnataka , besides being experienced mps .
not if union minister of state for finance dhananjaya kumar , who is believed be close to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , could help it though .
however , the cancer will always show up in a bone - marrow examination .
aml can , in fact , move fast from first presentation to serious illness .
the wbc count generally rises dramatically when there is an infection or proliferation of cancer cells in the blood .
he was specifically asked to follow up but he did n ' t even when the feverish bouts returned and he lost weight and appetite .
kumaramangalam also seemed to first believe he had malaria since he had just returned from a trip to the andamans .
news of the real summit in washington was buried in an inside page amid more stories about bill gates .
if media hysteria was not embarrassing enough we had our chief ministers queuing up before gates with begging bowls in their hands .
it was a chance for him to seize the moment and talk about the sort of issues that make the world the global village it has become .
environmental issues affect us all as does the fight against poverty , disease , terrorism , drugs .
where is the question of computers without electricity ?
the late power minister rangarajan kumaramangalam went blue in the face warning people about total darkness in two years unless power distribution systems were privatised .
he did this without being able to do anything about it because the wheels of vajpayee ' s government continue to turn at third world pace .
the story is not much different when it comes to roads .
he is not the only wrong man in the wrong job .
it can now rightfully be said that india counts for far more in the world today than it did two years ago .
more important , this newly acquired relevance has successfully combined national security , economics and the clout of the indian diaspora .
under vajpayee , india has junked much of its archaic nehruvian baggage and pursued an alternative course diligently and with some finesse .
the pace and priorities of economic reforms were almost exclusively - the promotion of information technology is the great exception - dictated by the exigencies of international relations .
a rare visitor to the state now became a frequent flier on the delhi - bangalore route .
within party circles , his aides claim that 20 of the 44 mlas in the state are behind him .
it did n ' t ruffle ananth kumar ' s feathers in the least .
for one , his visits to bangalore have been more than frequent , right from his days as the high - flying minister for civil aviation .
two , his role as the de facto bjp chief in karnataka is no secret .
successive state chiefs from b . s . yediyurappa to k . s . eshwarappa and even the present opposition leader jagdish shettar owe their allegiance to him .
the cpi ( m ) has rung the curtain down on all speculation about basu ' s resignation .
there are over 35,000 polling booths spread across the state ' s 294 assembly constituencies .
there is a new twist in the strategy though .
ghosh was present with basu in most of the chief minister ' s recent public meetings .
" i wanted to remove the tag of money - order economy from uttaranchal and make it self - dependent , " he says .
no joke : what ' s in a laugh ?
post - september 11 , security arrangements improved only marginally .

after nine weeks , the birds could distinguish previously unseen works by the two painters .
the pigeons performed almost as well as a group of humans on a similar course .

the only snag is , " zero " interest turns out to be , in reality , more like 8 - 10 per cent .

after inoculation , dogs ' blood is seldom tested to check whether they have developed sufficient antibodies .
in the short term , preventive vaccination for humans assumes importance .

these were path - breaking changes in indian cinema which had gone " talkie " only five years earlier .
the mike and lights were so restricting that acting was limited to hamming the lines with the body in stony immobility .
in those pre - dubbing years , he could summon the skill to live from one mike - point to another while singing .
he was the precursor of the industry ' s " star " phenomenon .
kismet ran in a kolkata theatre for three years ; in mumbai a theatre was named after it .

give me the name of one alleged criminal who you have tried . ' "
the taunting questions of the unnamed pakistani official explain why terrorists felt encouraged to try and kill off virtually our entire political class on december 13 .
when murderers and rapists can remain " under trial " for 20 years , why should it be different for terrorists ?
yet , you almost never hear our political leaders tell us how and when they plan to improve the justice system .
why is it so hard for our political leaders to admit that the fault lies as much within our borders as without ?
if you have n ' t heard of debabrata biswas , you have n ' t missed much .
he ' s 56 , general secretary of the forward bloc and rajya sabha member from west bengal .
vajpayee had visited the temple recently and made some carefully vague remarks on the ashes , supposedly netaji ' s , kept there .
the forward bloc , the party bose founded , refuses to believe he died in an air crash in 1945 .
the netaji industry holds he was imprisoned by stalin .
biswas is upset vajpayee has lent legitimacy to renkoji especially when the " matter was sub judice " .
the commission , on its part , has visited locations ranging from london to faizabad in search of clues .

the year 2001 was , however , important for another interesting development : the increasing growth on american soil of homegrown talent in films and theatre .
nair bagged the top prize at the venice film festival for monsoon wed - ding , which has also been nominated for the golden globe .
her other film , hysterical blindness , starring uma thurman , will run on the hbo channel .
in a similar way , south asian actors seem to be all over the tv screen .
inspired by these glitzy achievements , young indian - americans also began turning their focus to filmmaking .
one of the happy success stories of indian - american independent filmmaking was the cross - cultural comedy american desi .

and quaid - e - azam mohammed ali jinnah ' s vision of a progressive , pluralistic pakistan has finally been reinstated .
his is not the first effort at reform .
field marshal ayub khan had launched a reconstruction of the country in the 1960s with a reformer ' s zeal .
bhutto ' s successor , general zia remained wedded to the status quo , linking his survival to a cosmetic " islamisation " .
but these attempts failed , primarily because of an absence of a democratic political base that allowed space for genuine political pluralism .
first , he needs to give the country a healing touch of reconciliation by reaching out to the political forces .
the herculean task that he has set out to achieve requires a large heart and a big vision .
second , the failure to develop " rules of the game " has consigned pakistan to chronic instability .

coming at a time when tensions between india and pakistan are at an all - time high , the news of the test did raise an international storm .
but india has already proved its point - it now has a range of options to chose from to strike at its hostile neighbour in case the unthinkable happens .
a few days ago it was n ' t possible .
this made it difficult to attract highly mobile people with the special talents that are required in a modern economy .

why have the dalits suddenly turned to the private sector ?
for the first time , the dalit imagination has moved away from reservation and government jobs .
" they have put forth their demand in the language of the new age economy . "
the corporate sector has responded warily .
" if job quotas are imposed on us we wo n ' t be able to compete internationally , " cautions industrialist arun bharat ram .

at least not in savings bank accounts .
if the balance in an individual ' s savings account exceeds a specified amount , the excess cash flows into an fd that offers a higher rate of interest .
most private banks are offering this facility ( see table ) .
such two - in - one accounts offer three distinct advantages to accountholders : convenience , better returns and flexibility .
since funds flow into the fd automatically , no paper work is required .
second , money never sits idle in a savings account which offers a measly interest rate of 4 per cent .
the ppf account should be at least a year old .
how much did small investors get out of the rs 834 - crore bharti tele - ventures ipo ?

rs 2,496 crore was the total net amount invested in all mutual funds in the past one year .

a former mujahideen commander , haq ' s ties with the cia went back to the soviet - afghan war of the 1980s .
he had strong links with the pashtoon leadership in afghanistan as well as with the anti - taliban and largely non - pashtoon northern alliance .
he was , however , betrayed by an informer and killed by the taliban .
if he had succeeded , the us could have bypassed the pakistani government in putting together a post - taliban regime .
islamabad prefers an ethnically riven neighbour .
haq ' s wife and family were murdered by the taliban in peshawar in 1999 .

the ad in bold capital letters hits the eye .
this was in 1997 .

the state ' s recent animal census shows a marked decrease in tiger population - from 276 in 1993 to 238 last year .

shortage of funds is another hurdle .
in cricket , exactly a year from now - less than zero .
england lost 13 straight games before beating zimbabwe 5 - 0 and coming back from behind against india .
new zealand have beaten australia three times in their last four games .
the national side remains a 50 - 50 team , and one - off sides do n ' t usually win a world cup .
against england a bunch of young batsmen who were put in front of the headlights of pressure , froze .
strangely each of them had begun looking like they could .
former india batsman dilip sardesai says , " they need some experience in the middle order . "
i think we ' ve left things too late , " says former india wicket - keeper kiran more .
between now and the world cup , india are scheduled to play at least 23 one - day internationals .
each of those 23 games could be a rung up a ladder or lurch down a blind alley .
it depends entirely on those involved - officials , selectors , captain , coach and individual players .
if selections made from now fulfil whims rather than filling slots , the team is doubly doomed .

jaswant drafted a letter lauding the efforts of the uae government , particularly the sheikh , in bringing the criminal to book .
any mention of begum sumru in history books is likely to be confined to the footnotes .
sumru ' s last master , shah alam , the emperor of delhi , awarded him the jagir of sardhana .
it stayed with her for 58 years till her death - after a life full of love affairs and intrigue - in 1836 .
three years after her husband ' s death , the begum converted to christianity and took on the name joanna .
in 1793 she married le vaisseau , a french officer in her service .

" but look how the sari has survived .
its unstitched quality gives it many possibilities for individualism , " she says .
dhamija often teams her saris with tie - back fisherwoman - style cholis .
the luscious new look of the sari began when some indian designers decided to make the sari a canvas for their creativity .
these designers have combined varying textures , designs and weaves .
kapur combines handloom bustiers with her saris , which are an amalgamation of textile traditions from different parts of india .
a queer mix , perhaps , but a fascinating one attracting more and more women .
it is a heady mix of elegance , sex appeal , feminine mystery , individuality and adaptability .
like tradition , the sari has kept its acceptability and appeal intact down the ages .
unlike any other piece of clothing across the world , the sari is the garment of the past with limitless possibilities for the future .
what took me there were rumours that something significant and surprisingly unobserved was going on within .
for a chief minister who prides himself on an unsullied reputation , naveen patnaik is going to unseemly lengths to protect it .
it all began with two cbi inquiries into alleged scams in the water resources and agriculture department during the previous congress regime .
today , the agency is probing no less than six irregularities .
patnaik has also instituted eight judicial inquiries while the crime branch of the orissa police is investigating nine alleged improprieties .
this , besides half - a - dozen vigilance probes involving three cabinet ministers whom patnaik had dropped earlier on corruption charges .
" i order probes because my government has little to hide , " explains the chief minister .
patnaik ' s untainted image may yet be his strongest asset .
the mps cannot remain absent for more than 60 days at a stretch during a parliament session without seeking leave of absence from the house .
failure to do this can lead to their membership being terminated .
but it ' s not always as easy to disqualify an mp .
take cpi ( m ) rajya sabha member t . s . gurung .
between 1987 and 1989 , gurung was absent for more than 80 days at a stretch .
however , before he could furnish a reply , the rajya sabha secretariat received a message on january 13 , 1989 , intimating it of gurung ' s assassination .
instead of a disqualification motion , an obituary motion was adopted on february 21 .
most parliamentarians do n ' t mind giving a long rope to colleagues who often absent themselves from the house .
for instance , no mp opposes a hike in pay or perks and there is complete unanimity on not condoning a reprimand to an mp , says kashyap .
though most of the party leaders express concern at lack of attendance in the house , not many are willing to offer concrete suggestions .
clearly , manufacturers are taking advantage of our craze for things " phoren " .

during the campaign , the bjp leaders did their best to stress the importance of hindu nationalism in these troubled times .
what is going wrong ?
he will be remembered mainly for giving the state yet another caste category : most backward as opposed to other backward .
he should have realised that when it comes to playing the caste game , he is an amateur compared to mulayam and mayawati .
to come back to governance , the problem in the bjp lies at the very top .
the prime minister ' s approach to governance has been to continue ruling in the same way as everyone did before him .
there are in delhi government departments so obsolete that they should have been closed down years ago .
why do they continue to exist ?
there are officials who fritter away taxpayers ' money on things that nobody needs them to be doing .
we do not need them to organise film festivals or even writers ' conferences .
we do not need a ministry of information &amp; broadcasting or a press information bureau or a ministry of food processing .
we do need bigger and more powerful ministries dealing with social and physical infrastructure .
the two face each other as leaders of rival political parties heading the nation ' s executive and the legislature .
the radical marxist jvp ( people ' s liberation front ) and the hardline nationalist su ( sinhalese heritage ) parties are opposed to the peace pact .
for wickremesinghe ' s government , fighting is not a viable option .
it has inherited an empty treasury and an economy that is in recession .
for the tigers , the compulsions of getting to the peace table are related to the september 11 attacks and the international crackdown on terrorism .

then there is an array of suitably glitzy judges - chowta , singer shubha mudgal , malhotra and model - veejay sushma reddy .
this selection process was liberally peppered with off - key renditions of chura liya and jaane jaan .
" we needed some uniformity , especially at the beginning of the auditions , in order to be fair , " explains mudgal .
equally important was finding a tv - friendly group with an ability to jell with each other and , of course , sporting an " attitude " .
chowta says , " some girls protested when they were not selected .
that ' s exactly the kind of attitude we wanted .
girls who could talk back , who think they are worth it . "

significantly , freight fares - one of the highest in the world - have not been hiked , barring marginal adjustments .
by hiking fares , kumar has tried to stem one of railways ' most intractable problems - cross subsidy .
irrationally , high freight rates pay for artificially low passenger fares .
as railways lost freight share to roads , it was caught in a double whammy of falling revenue growth and steep rise in costs .
the budget also attempts to tap alternative sources of funding , including the private sector , psus and state governments .
worsening financial conditions , rising wage bill and high operational cost due to lack of focus demand drastic measures .
but keeping political compulsions in mind , this was the best the minister could do .

the sobering reference to gujarat was obvious .

we need to ask ourselves why .
we need for a start to ask the prime minister why he finds it so hard to control the hindutva fanatics his own party has bred and nurtured .
why can they not be ordered instantly to stop their temple building activities in ayodhya ?

former india players reporting on the world cup were shocked .
" i really do n ' t understand what the team is playing , " said former star forward jagbir singh .
" you do n ' t want to play the traditional system , fine .
but this is neither here nor there . "
kumar now says the team ' s failings were tactical .
" we were going wrong tactically in the previous matches .
( dhanraj ) pillay has to be left alone in the circle and jugraj ( singh ) is a full back so he should be played in that position .
that ' s what i am trying to do . "
like a few had feared , the world cup exposed younger players - such as kanwalpreet singh - to a quality of competition they were not ready for .
with substitutions coming in fast and furious , the team was unable to settle down .
when the indians lost their fourth match to england , dissension broke out in the ranks .
a few team members accused captain baljit singh dhillon and his brother daljit of trying to score goals on their own .
according to d ' souza ' s rules , no player who missed a camp would be eligible for selection .
star forward pillay had missed a camp and , therefore , the world cup qualifiers .
saini , who had chicken pox and could n ' t participate in the world cup camp , made it to the team .
daljit replaced gagan ajit , on the ground that gagan was not in good form before the world cup .

on march 13 , reckitt benckiser plc - makers of dettol and many other consumer products - decided to bid goodbye to the indian stock markets .
the company made an offer to buy shares of its indian subsidiary from shareholders , which will eventually lead to its delisting from stock exchanges .
the rush to delist has raised several disturbing questions . what effect will this sudden exit of some mncs have on india ' s rather shallow stock markets ?
how will corporate india react ?
and where do investors stand ?
this number rose to eight in 2000 and almost doubled to 14 in 2001 .
if the delisting plans materialise , whatever little depth the indian stock markets have will be further reduced .
the top 50 stocks account for more than 90 per cent of the trading volumes on indian stock exchanges .
yet , the move has made the market nervous .
delisting is not the only way mncs are opting to stay out of the indian stock markets .
for instance , soft - drink giant coca - cola inc is seeking exemption from a public issue .
korean car manufacturer hyundai though is not averse to going public as per its agreement next year .
while everybody is concerned at the delisting trend no one is pressing for stalling it through a fiat .
as long as it remains small , who would want to get listed here ? " asks vallabh bhansali , director , enam financial consultants .
some also see a silver lining in the flight of mncs from the capital market .
there is only one snag : it is clear that these short - term gains are compromising the long - term stability and development of the indian capital markets .

i cannot understand either why muslims should have any problems giving up the idea of building another mosque in ayodhya .
in view of what happened to the babri masjid , do we need another mosque there ?

for the radical hindu , it is a vedic republic of permanent bliss .
he has lost his kingdom - first to the invader , then to the elected ruler .
he was let down by politics , so he sought mythology .
that politics , in retrospect , was rooted in a false ideology .
secularism , like communalism , is essentially an indian ism , and like every other ism , it is a conceit .
the political conceit of the congress century .
and the bharatiya janata party was always translated in the foreign media as the hindu nationalist party .
maybe it was a freudian synonym for the indian people ' s party .
once again , he is arguing with history as well as mythology , and arguments in religion have always been violent .

this inverse relationship between caste and communal politics has been true of tamil nadu and kerala for many decades .
kerala is especially significant as muslims have constituted over 20 per cent of its population for a long time .
due to the clout of their principal party , the muslim league , muslims have received many concessions .
yet there has been virtually no hindu - muslim rioting in the state .
the malayalis do not generally associate the muslim league with communally provocative politics , only with community - based politics .
this inverse relationship suggests another important conclusion .

the women were initially reluctant because few realised the value of savings .

and the home loan market is expected to cross rs 15,000 crore in 2001 - 2 from rs 7,000 crore in 1998 - 99 .

many banks are finding it difficult to manage their growth .
internet sites are often down , atms are often too crowded , nullifying the very purpose for which they were set up .
" there is no point in continuing in power if you lose your credibility . "
vajpayee , for once , was rendered speechless .
" the only link now is that some swayamsevaks are in the government , " said rss spokesman m . g . vaidya .
the indictment could n ' t have been stronger .
vaidya ' s statement created a flutter in the party circles .
by political convention , such a controversy is resolved with a clarification or an explanatory statement .
but it would be an exaggeration to say that there is a danger of the rss calling it quits .
but within the rss , pracharaks are livid and look at the vhp ' s sudden climbdown to save the vajpayee government as a loss of face .
their argument : what is the point of supporting a political organisation that is indifferent to the rss agenda .
the rss leadership is expected to vociferously raise the hindutva pitch , unmindful of its consequences for the nda government .
the statement expectedly came in for sharp criticism from the opposition , some nda partners as well as a section of bjp leaders .
the hindutva torch - bearers within the bjp are undeterred .
" we should not allow any anti - hindu government to continue , " says gorakhpur bjp mp , yogi adityanath .
even the usually laidback parliamentary backbenchers are getting restive .

whenever the two have operated in tandem , the results have been encouraging .
pakistan has stepped up efforts for evolving a consensus within the disparate pashtoon factions as a step towards their participation in a broad - based government .

no goodwill and no safety , the rss explains , unless muslims " respect , tolerate and cooperate " with the hindus .
what remains unclear is who is going to decide whether the muslims are behaving themselves or not , or when open season begins .
should muslims consider themselves unsafe in india because they are not " cooperating " in allowing mosques in ayodhya , mathura and kashi to be turned into temples ?
should they consider themselves unsafe because muslim terrorists kill hindu villagers in kashmir ?
the prime minister is right when he says that we need the economy to grow at 8 per cent .
the sjm , for instance , would like the government to pour even more money into our defunct , money - guzzling public sector .
there are other swadeshi ideas the rss economists have thrown up which if followed would guarantee permanent poverty for india .
ironically , the one person they have helped most through their obduracy is congress president sonia gandhi .
when the next election gives us our first italian prime minister the rss can take full credit .
it would be interesting then to listen to them explain why out of more than 800 million " proud " hindus we cannot find a single leader .

one never came across a whole village of blacksmiths , as in contemporary russia or burma .
generations of such workers have provided india with a long and glorious tradition of artistic handicrafts of a varied nature .
among the textiles , cotton cloth has played a great role in our history and also in our relations with the outside world .
cotton is mentioned in the writings of manu in 800 b . c .
the fine dacca muslin was the envy of the world for centuries together .
unfortunately , the indian cotton was of a poor quality and it was the high workmanship that earned india a name for her fabrics .
indian silks , brocades and embroidery have to this day preserved their uniqueness and beauty .
it is a proud monument to the forging and fabricating ingenuity of ancient india .
it has also been said that the famous damascus blades were made from steel imported from india .
the loharthe village smithsmelted iron in his primitive iron smelter and turned out goods for household use ; he also made simple agricultural tools and implements .
the ancient indian was a master at manipulating metal .
alongside the insular village islands of economic self - sufficiency also existed a small but changing number of urban centres for local manufacture of specialities and luxuries .
these were generally found in the capitals of kings and of the nobility , at large pilgrim centres or in places from where goods could be exported .
these , however , depended on the availability of certain raw materials and the presence of specialised knowledge .
on the whole , they were insignificant and later met the same fate as the other two categories .
modernisation of agriculture and transport was the basic change brought about by the commercial revolution .
europe changed fast during these two centuries and these changes were to have a profound impact on india ' s relations with the west .
the discovery of america and an all - sea route to india , towards the close of the 15th century , radically altered the horizon of europe .
the first east - west contact effected through the crusades gradually became closer and many sided .
centuries of isolation had ended , and india was , as it were , exposed overnight to the full glare of an alien people and their culture .
its expanding trade brought into india for a while the much sought - after precious metal in exchange for indian goods .
the company did not alter either the ways or the organisation of the indigenous industry .
it bought goods through the dealers or direct from the craftsmen , depending upon the circumstances .
in madras the company also tried to attract the workers to seek employment in workshops as in the days of the old courts .
the acquisition of political power by the company , however , spelt harm to indian commercial interests .
in the process they did great damage to industry in bengal during the years following the battle of plassey .
it was too late by the time the company realised that it was killing the goose that laid the golden egg .
the famed dacca muslin industry became almost extinct the moment the prop of the royal court was removed .
in specific cases , it even encouraged and helped their growth in order to sustain its own trade with england .
the situation , however , had changed radically by the time the ' home government ' took over the direct administration of this country after 1857 .
it was no longer necessary to hold india by force or by political power .
once the lancashire industry was able to attain enough competitive strength and the indian industries were sapped of their vitality , tariffs were abolished .
while they released unlimited individual initiative and ushered in the industrial revolution in the former country , they foredoomed all chances of survivial for india ' s industries .
no co - ordinated railway policy was possible because of the multiple ownership and management of the railways .
free trade together with the railway policies sounded the death knell of indian enterprise .
although , in the beginning , they were started by individual capitalists , the factory system came to be adopted during the course of the 19th century .
they were also gradually converted into joint - stock companies on the lines of the manufacturing organisations .
this meant the employment of a stable labour force and the use of modern equipment and methods of production .
severe penalties were imposed on the use of indigo in many european countries ( excluding perhaps england ) .
starting with the role of buyers of indigo , some of the dealers went on to acquire land and a few of them emerged as independent producers .
the story of the unhappy relations between the european planters and the indian cultivators makes a pathetic reading .
some of the early planters were slave drivers from america from whom civilised behaviour could scarcely be expected .
in the sixties of the last century , an indigo commission enquired into the malpractices of the planters and their agents and revealed an agonising situation .
british capital and enterprise were the first in the field .
this was the beginning of the tea industry in india .
tea plantation offered a further and fresh scope for european capital and enterprise .
india had all the pre - requisites for the cultivation of tea on a wide scale .
labour had to be transported later from a distance , but that was not a serious bottleneck .
the company undertook in all earnestness its programme of tea plantation .
the first india - grown tea was available for sale in the london market in 1838 .
however , the teething troubles were soon overcome and the company started showing handsome profits .
there was qualitative improvement as well .
during these years , output increased out of all proportion to the expansion of acreage .
large - scale operations and progressive mechanisation resulted in cheaper production and improved quality .
as a result , indian tea succeeded in driving out chinese tea from the european markets .
but in the meanwhile , ceylon emerged as a competitor .
as a consequence , there was a fall in the acreage and output between 1902 and 1906 . things , however , once again started looking up after this .
this was disastrous enough , but a greater tragedy was soon to befall the industry .
a short spell of prosperity intervened during 1889 - 96 , following political trouble in brazil , but the depressing trend revived soon after .
the area under coffee progressively increased after 1860 and was 237,500 acres in 1885 .
within the next ten years it was up at 274,000 acres .
exports , which constituted about 95 per cent of the crop , were , however , generally steady .
the quality of indian coffee had been particularly good , and the price fetched by it fairly high .
these have a far - reaching impact on trade , industry and financein fact , on the entire life of a community and the generations that follow .
till the middle of the 19th century , transport facilities in india were poor and inadequate and had remained unchanged for centuries .
canals in india had never played the same role as those in england or on the continent .
even though the guarantee system was given up in 1869 , the liability of the government in regard to capital , already sunk , persisted .
in the first ten years ( 1849 - 59 ) of the system , government paid out rs 2.2 crores to the companies .
the guarantee system was discontinued and the second phase of the railway construction began .
government undertook the work on its own during the next ten years , 1870 - 80 .
however , this advantage was set at naught by the ill - conceived policy on the new lines , and by certain unforeseen circumstances like famines and exchange difficulties .
the lines were making profits , and the shares were quoted at a premium .
the third and , for decades , the final phase was inaugurated in 1880 .
in the following years , government , continuing as it did with direct construction , encouraged private companies once again .
this time there was no guarantee , but invariably financial assistance had to be provided by the government .
at the same time , some of the native states undertook construction of railways within their own jurisdiction .
however , railway policy remained unsettled for the next few years .
famines underscored the need for faster construction , but the afghan war caused a diversion of resources .
for the next few years , despatches continued to be exchanged between the secretary of state and the indian government .
or did they disintegrate and destroy them ?
this facilitated the export of raw materials and the import of machine - made products .
there also emerged a freight structure , which encouraged foreign trade at the expense of internal trade .
so , more than the railways , it was the rates policy that merited criticism .
was it not possible to reduce this cost ?
indiscriminate competition between companies harmed the interests of the community .
the financial effect of the railways was the main target of the critics .
after 1900 , the railways started earning profits , except in a few bad years at intervals .
this is a controversial issue of only historical significance .
rumour has it that when she was being given the order of the boot , the prime minister virtually told her that she was taking her job too seriously .
some sly professor had used taxpayers ' money for his personal research .
is it then any surprise that vajpayee should be so full of praise for indira ' s approach to art and culture ?
any surprise that maneka should get the chop and sonia words of praise ?
any surprise that we should ask if he is joining the congress party ?
these contrasts in economic developement in india and europe are of significance in a comparative study of the growth process .
coal mining as such was unknown before the europeans arrived in india .
the east india company found it more convenient to ship coal from england as ballast rather than explore the prospects of indigenous production .
before the end of the 18th century , however , the company authorities began evincing interest in local mining .
inevitably , the early production was on a small scale and the coal obtained was of an inferior quality .
the contemporary demand emanated mainly from a few steam engines with the result that there was no inducement for rapid expansion .
he initiated tests to establish the quality of the indigenous coal .
the results , however , were unfavourable as it was later discovered that the coal samples were not correctly chosen .
in the meanwhile , bengal coal was in fact being used for local manufacture .
rupert jones , who was responsible for these tests , was given a licence and an advance on easy terms to work the bengal mines .
no mines were , however , opened in the next twenty years .
the output of the raniganj mine was 36,000 tonnes by that time .
three more mines were opened between 1840 and 1854 .
the laying of the railways facilitated the movement of the coal and also created a market for it .
the opening of the east indian railway in 1854 which ran through the coal areas of bengal , provided a stimulus to the industry .
the most important mines opened up in later years were jharia and giridih , of which jharia before long overshadowed even raniganj .
outside bengal , the noted coal - fields exploited subsequently were singareni in hyderabad , makum in assam and a few others in central india .
imports , however , continued to increase in the beginning , because demand for coal , particularly from the railways , outstripped indigenous output .
imports were also necessitated by the imbalance in the regional dispersal of coal mines .
here a proper railway rates policy would have played a positive role .
railway freights were high , though even the maritime rates were no less onerous .
the bulk of the imports had its destination in bombay and western india .
but imports declined steadily towards the end of the last century , and more rapidly after 1900 .
in keeping with the increase in production , and in the number of collieries , the number of persons employed in the industry also increased .
in 1880 , there were 20,000 persons employed .
this number rose to about a lakh in the next twenty - five years , and exceeded a lakh - and - a - half in 1914 .
against this phenomenal growth of the industry must be set some of its limitations and deficiencies .
we have already observed the regional imbalance in coal deposits .
most of the deposits were concentrated in the ' gondwana system ' stretching east - west across bengal , bihar and orissa , central india and the central provinces .
the earliest enterprise dated to 1777 , when m / s farquhar and motte undertook to smelt iron in the vicinity of the jharia coal mines .
the next proposal of smelting iron ore was mooted by heath , an official of the east india company , around 1815 .
but production on any significant scale was started only at these two places .
the steel produced was said to be of a high quality and had a ready market in england .
however , even though production continued , these enterprises were not a financial success .
modern factory production was a new phenomenon in india when the first textile mills were started .
but textile technology did not constitute such a revolutionary departure from the past as did steel technology .
moreover , the textile industry grew through diffused efforts , each involving little risk and comparatively much less capital .
all the efforts at pig - iron making had failed so far because they were charcoal based .
tata realised that it was essential first to establish the existence of coal and iron ores in close proximity to make steel making viable .
on investigation , tata , however , found that there were difficulties in working the loharu iron ore deposits .
he got , at his own expense , foreign experts to visit india to explore the prospects of setting up steel works in bengal and bihar .
in spite of a chain of failures , some experts were sanguine that a viable steel industry was possible in india .
one such was gen . mahon , an artillery officer , whose memorable report on steel manufacture in india appeared in 1899 .
under lord curzon ' s administration in india , favourable changes were taking place in regard to the rules of mining licences , land lease , etc .
before returning home , tata visited germany and the united states , and brought with him a consultancy metallurgical engineer .
the next area to be investigated was durg district in the central provinces .
here the iron ores were abundant , but there was no coal nearby .
in the past , most of the capital for investment in india was raised in the london money market .
serious doubts were entertained about the availability of capital in india and the readiness of the investors to risk it .
there were historical reasons for this .
cheap lancashire yarn had found a large ready market in india .
moreover , they also soon realised that they could push this advantage still further by capturing the markets of china and also of japan .
yarn exports were on the whole subject to fluctuations due to economic and political reasons .
it may , therefore , be noted that the spindle - loom growth pattern assumed a new character .
about four - fifths of the output comprised grey unbleached cloth .
the exports were not , however , very considerable , being valued only at about rs 2 crores or so .
our dependence oh imports , mostly from the uk , continued to be heavy , as increase in internal production was modest considering the total demand .
at the same time , its imports were reduced to a negligible figure .
thus , both in output and exports , japan had forged ahead of india on the eve of the war .
this was followed in 1862 - 63 by the gouripur and the seragunj jute factories .
only one more mill , viz . the india jute mills , came into existence during the sixties .
there sprang up , in quick succession , a number of mills " until the banks of the hooghly literally teemed with their smoking chimneys " .
and in the ding - dong battle for supremacy in jute manufacture , the initiative which was lost to dundee was snatched back by bengal .
between 1860 and 1880 some twenty more mills were established .
progress was rapid during 1872 - 75 when as many as thirteen new companies were floated .
but 1875 - 82 was a period of depression , and only one new mill was started during these years , while four existing ones ceased working .
the association was not called upon to resort to regulation of output during the next three decades .
but what made the calcutta industry impregnable was the ' absurdly low price ' of jute .
this gave indian mills a tremendous competitive advantage .
as we have seen , the initial capital for the industry came from england .
gradually , the proportion of rupee capital substantially increased .
finding these grey - haired matrons training with air pistols , the villagers started sending their children to rajpal ' s classes .
today , the club ' s membership has crossed 200 - and johri sends big contingents to the national championships .
all this when rajpal ' s shooters train with antiquated weapons on a primitive , thatch - roofed range .
rahul gandhi , son of former prime minister rajiv gandhi and once a rajpal trainee , gifted an imported air pistol .
so did jayant singh , son of union agriculture minister ajit singh .
all these have helped .
shooting has even helped rajpal ' s two sons find jobs with the indian airlines .
the occupational census data too underline the general insignificance of industry ( modern and traditional ) and the preponderance of agriculture and allied pursuits .
even so , the figures must be cautiously used in view of the changes in definitions and methodology used from census to census .
however , the fact of preponderance of agriculture and the insignificance of industry stand out unmistakably .
in the preceding chapters , investment in individual industries has been indicated wherever possible , but the information is not always precise and comprehensive .
but the war once again clinched the issue .
the hostilities made imports difficult and stimulated home industries .
even that symbol , the last vestige of free trade policy , viz . excise duty on cotton goods , was removed , albeit temporarily .
thus protection was automatically provided during the war years .
however , the post - war years had their crop of problems necessitating an active consideration of a positive tariff policy .
moreover , the montague - chelmsford reforms had been announced in the meanwhile , and the autonomy that it conceded would sound hollow without fiscal autonomy .
as the price of silver rose , the exchange rate appreciated reaching 2s to a rupee in 1920 .
this discouraged exports and stimulated imports .
then the tide turned ; the world boom burst and rupee value started sliding .
within a year it slumped from 2s to 1s 3d .
but , when in 1925 the british sterling went back to gold , there was further appreciation of the rupee .
the situation was further aggravated when the unprecedented world depression set in after 1929 .
the post - war years witnessed a dire shortage of rolling stock .
worn out locomotives were in operation .
this proved a much more serious handicap and source of public resentment during the post - war boom of 1919 - 20 than during the war years .
as a result , a forceful public opinion in favour of state ownership of the railways was built up .
as a sequel to the acworth committee ' s report , ambitious expansion programmes were contemplated .
in 1935 , all payments to the general revenues were suspended .
capital - at - charge , however , increased faster , gross earnings fluctuated but working expenses remained relatively steady .
the net earnings slumped in the early thirties .
freight charges were among the lowest in the world , and were justified by the peculiar circumstances in the country .
in fact carriage of coal at the existing rates to distant centres was uneconomic , and imported coal was found cheaper at many places .
here , therefore , was another aspect of the policy needing scrutiny .
while the railways were forging ahead , roads were generally neglected .
by the turn of the last century , there were 37,000 miles of metalled and 136,000 miles of unmetalled roads .
but their number increased rapidly since .
freight movement by trucks increased as feeder to the railways .
imports of motor cars increased from 3,000 in 1913 to about 20,000 a year on the eve of the depression .
the figure slumped to a little over 6,000 in 1932 - 33 , but improved to 16,000 after 1937 .
an equal number of commercial vehicles were imported every year at this time .
in the meanwhile , efforts were being made to improve road conditions .
the indian road development committee recommended in 1928 the setting up of a central road fund , which came into being the following year .
the committee ' s other recommendations , like holding of periodical conferences , abolition of road tolls , etc . were also implemented .
this was in marked contrast to the developments in other countries .
only a beginning had been made in civil aviation .
so the railways remained under constant strain and presented a picture of congestion , crowding and inadequacy .
the transport and communication system , as it developed through the war and the inter - war years , made for an economic transition in the country .
as the war broke out , industries received an initial set - back but soon found exceptional opportunities for expansion .
the coal industry was no exception .
the coal industry , which had enjoyed a steady spell of prosperity during the pre - war years , saw unprecedented growth and fortune till 1921 .
coastal shipping of coal came to a halt , and the entire burden of coal movement fell on the railways .
then production declined slightly but soon picked up and reached 20 million tons in 1926 .
during this period , the share of indigenous coal in total consumption was increasing .
it slowly improved to rs 10.6 crores in 1938 .
this depressed state of the industry was the combined effect of its internal deficiencies and the emergence of substitutes in the form of hydro - electricity and oil .
during the post - war boom many new mines were opened .
but the consequent economic crisis and the later depression pushed the smaller and less efficient units out of the field .
the industry , however , remained over - extended , and was still cluttered up with numerous small collieries which did not afford modern machinery and electrification .
in many cases , machinery was not properly or fully used , or it was just left to rust .
in spite of shallow mines and cheap labour , these deficiencies of organisation , techniques of production and poor quality constituted serious handicaps .
the trade union influence in japanese industry was yet to develop , while it was already very strong in india , particularly in bombay .
downward adjustment of wages was vehemently resisted in india and the bombay mills were plagued by frequent labour strikes .
the tariff board , however , calculated that the saving in the cost of manufacture on this account was not so great as to make ' undercutting ' possible .
the tariff policy had to be oriented to revenue needs in the first instance .
for once the government acted promptly and levied a 40 per cent duty on them , which was soon raised to 50 per cent by a surcharge .
depreciating yen once again was a factor favouring the japanese .
the board was asked to work out the implications of this constraint .
the following table makes it clear that the capacity of the industry remained rather stagnant during the decade 1926 - 36 :
both imports and exports declined through the early thirties , and imports continued to fall thereafter also .
exports recovered and touched the pre - depression level in 1936 - 37 and improved further in the following year .
internal availability improved through the thirties , reaching an all - time high in 1938 - 39 at 4,734 million yards .
what was of more significance was that the indian mills could now meet almost all domestic requirements .
they supplied just half of the cloth consumed during 1924 - 29 , but in 1938 - 39 their share jumped to 87 per cent .
the usa bought over 60 per cent of our gunny bags .
our exports of twist and yarn found their way to almost all countries .
exports of raw jute fell from 8 lakh tons in 1929 - 30 to 6 lakh tons in 1930 - 31 .
however , the world demand was falling and , pressed by the depression , the search for cheaper substitutes gained an edge .
the government initiated proposals for crop restriction , research and development of markets .
in spite of profitability of pig iron production , the company converted most of it into finished steel to relieve steel shortage .
the team found ample scope for exports .
there was also a ready market in usa , the uk and japan for ferro - manganese , which was produced for the first time in india in 1916 .
but the company concentrated on meeting the war needs .
the higher capacity was expected to meet the growing demand for galvanised sheets , bars and plates .
there was also a fall in the internal demand , and a labour strike in 1928 rendered the tatas ' position vulnerable .
thus further protection was necessitated .
it was creditable that the ensuing depression should have been weathered by the company through continuous expansion and excellent management .
of the rs 18 crores required for the gep , as much as rs 4 crores came from internal resources .
steel production reached 66,000 tons in 1934 - 35 .
recovery set in after 1935 , and the plant capacity reached 800,000 tons on the eve of the second world war .
all this was achieved through additions and improvements and with the use of larger ingots .
among the principal ' infant ' industries of this period mention must be made of sugar , paper , and matches .
we shall briefly review the progress of these ' infant ' industries .
its growth was instrumental in converting india ' s substantial dependence on imports of sugar into an export surplus .
imports of sugar in 1929 - 30 amounted to 9.4 lakh tons and indigenous output to less than a lakh tons .
in 1931 - 32 , there were thirty - one factories producing 1.58 lakh tons of sugar .
in the next four years , the number of factories increased to 140 , and production crossed a million tons , doing away with the need for imports .
the tariff board conducted a summary enquiry in 1947 and recommended extension of protection by another two years .
protection was finally withdrawn in 1950 .
after the vigorous growth of the thirties , the industry seemed to have lost its dynamism .
it was later exposed to the vicissitudes inherent in the nature of an industry in which multiple interests were involved .
production having reached a million tons , it later fluctuated quite considerably .
the modern cement industry in india originated with the first world war , when the first factory was set up at porbandar .
pent - up war demand provided a stimulus to the industry , and seven more factories were set up during 1919 - 23 .
the total capacity thus reached about 5.8 lakh tons in 1924 , against an annual demand of 3.9 lakhs .
moreover , imports were resumed after the war .
the crises in the industry and the rejection of succour by the government brought to the manufacturers a sense of the need for self - discipline .
depression , however , intervened , and the situation did not improve till 1936 .
in 1939 the acc had twelve , dalmia five and other four factories .
expansion of the industry continued through the war years and by 1947 , the total installed capacity had exceeded 26 lakh tons .
demand for cement , however , was increasing faster , necessitating installation of further capacity .
the first world war provided a fillip and revived the glass industry which had been languishing in the face of competition from germany , austria and japan .
but , with the end of the war , foreign competition reasserted itself .
however , foreign competition , particularly from japan , kept on an increasing pressure on the industry .
the government , however , granted a rebate on imported soda ash used by the industry .
stimulus was once again provided by the second world war .
imports stopped and the demand increased .
the industry availed itself of this opportunity to modernise its equipment and diversify the output .
but the difficulties of the industry reappeared as soon as the war ended .
the industry sought protection once again , and the tariff board conducted an enquiry and reported in 1950 .
the number of factories increased from twenty in 1918 to 101 in 1938 - 39 and to 131 in 1950 .
besides , there were some 100 units in the cottage industries sector .
paper was another industry which owed its growth to protection .
protection was first granted in 1925 and , after periodical renewal , withdrawn in 1947 .
government levied a heavy revenue duty on imports of matches in 1922 and under the stimulus provided by this steep duty , a protected match industry emerged .
fifty - five firms were licensed to manufacture machine tools and lathes , drilling , shaping and planning machines , furnaces and power blowers .
the manufacture of several new items like heavy calibre guns , torpedo boats and degaussing cables was also started .
there were , however , soon many new lines of production started in order to meet the needs of civilian consumption and industrial requirements .
the hindustan aircraft company , a private enterprise , assembled its first aircraft in 1941 .
as will be seen in a later section , the tata iron and steel company successfully developed armoured cars .
it also succeeded in manufacturing alloy and tool steels , which were vitally needed for the prosecution of the war .
spurred by the war , metal fabricating industries like copper , copper sheets , wires and cables were started .
a wide variety of engineering industries also came into existence , or were expanded from modest capacities of pre - war years .
government ' s industrial policy resolution as well as its statement on foreign capital helped to clarify its stand on some basic issues .
labour relations continued to improve and transport bottlenecks were removed .
cotton , jute , steel and sugar industries , however , continued to suffer
the industry ' s profits increased by 50 per cent over the war years and had more than doubled by 1947 .
they fluctuated but remained much above the pre - war level during the years after partition .
some economists believe higher agricultural growth could boost industry and make this happen .
but the dull diwali contradicts this hope .
in essence we could well be looking at a gdp growth of less than 4.5 per cent .
myth : higher agricultural output this year will trigger a revival .
reality : true , after two years of decline , agriculture output is set to grow this year .
but to put it in context , one has to factor the extent of accretion in output and its multiplier effect .
according to the rbi , the net accretion to output in the kharif crop has been 2.5 million tonnes .
cmie estimates that this year the rabi output will be 104 million tonnes , or 11 million tonnes more than last year .
in other words additional spend in the rural economy will be up by around rs 10,000 crore even if one factors a multiplier effect .
but the finance ministry spiked the proposal saying such a fund was not envisaged in its financial procedures .
the ministry , however , made it clear that it was willing to provide supplementary grants as and when required .
the serious delay in this year ' s acquisition programme and the need for proper utilisation of resources was raised at the recent combined commanders ' conference .

there were other reasons .
the latter offers indian doctors an opportunity to apply directly to the authorities without going through recruitment agencies .
indian doctors in the uk are excited about the move and have welcomed it .
professor r . c . gupta , vice chairman of the overseas doctors association said : " this is a brilliant move .
there is a high demand for specialists in radiology and psychiatry . "
also , no doctor can practise without being registered with the gmc .
there are reportedly about 40,000 indian doctors registered with the gmc .
the number is likely to rise under the new scheme .
doctors are , however , unhappy with plab saying indian doctors could lose out on seniority because of such a test .
adds gupta : " more specialists should be appointed at the sub - consultant level instead of making them join at a far lower level . "
however , this will make quick visas easier .
the scheme also facilitates the entry of foreign students graduating in the uk into the national health system .
the scheme would further allow eminent scientists to base their research projects in the uk and would encourage the movement of business and financial experts to london .
says lord rooker : " it gives those at the top of their chosen profession the choice of making the uk their home . "

" by referring to the us example , they have willy - nilly emphasised on quality , which is a welcome sign , " he says .
however , his counterpart andre beteille flinches at the idea of extending job quotas .
" social change through reservation is a 19th century idea .

currently , 40 per cent of the rs 2,700 crore worth of pesticides produced in the country goes into protecting cotton crop .
naturally , the widespread use of bt cotton , they point out , would be detrimental to the growth of pesticide companies .
the pesticide manufacturers , on their part , say " the charges are not only unfounded but ridiculous " .
it is now for the union government to convince the farmers about the risks .
despite the raging controversy , it is yet to withdraw its directive on the destruction of the bt crop .
but unless it scientifically validates its arguments against the seed , the matter could get out of hand .
gujarat ' s cotton farmers are waiting .
the brutal killing of abdul haq has been a setback in the us plans to divide the taliban .
resigned : prabhat kumar , as governor of jharkhand , after being linked to corruption - tainted flex industries chief ashok chaturvedi .

jehadi revenge , an attempt at extorting ransom or an indian plot to defame pakistan ?
investigators now say they are on the verge of solving the case .
of the three , hashim " arif " qadeer had been identified earlier as a former harkat - ul - mujahideen activist .
the three suspects were picked up from their home when the police traced the e - mails to their computer .
sheikh was also the man pearl had gone to meet in karachi .
" now that we know who the people are , it is only a matter of time before they are tracked down , " he says .
a few investigators , however , doubt this .
" this operation is too well - organised to be the work of a few people , " says an investigator , who did not want to be named .
here ' s how it works .
if in march , he deposits another rs 10,000 , the full amount goes into a new fd .
suppose in april , the account holder needs to withdraw rs 15,000 .
the bank automatically debits rs 10,000 from his savings account and rs 5,000 from the latest fd .
the balance rs 5,000 in the march fd is shifted to the savings account .
there ' s good news for those who hold a ppf account with the state bank of india ( sbi ) or any of its associate banks .
filling up an application form is all they need to do to get an sbi credit card .
of this rs 1,55,400 crore went into fixed deposits and savings accounts and rs 17,694 crore in current deposits .
rs 25,668 crore in the past one year .
a reason for this could be uncertain investment environment .
the leaner , narrower page is in keeping with international trends . . .

he was also arrested .
strangely , the ad reappeared recently in leading newspapers .

part of the mountainous rubble of metal beams and frames that came down with the twin towers , it was shipped to chennai by a local scrap dealer .
he bought it at $ 122 per tonne from a dealer in dubai who in turn had bought it at a new york port authority auction .
right now , the scrap is being melted and made into ingots at smelting units near chennai and being ploughed back into new buildings as sturdy construction rods .
wtc might just find a way into chennai homes now .
amid the hurly burly of uttar pradesh elections , the man nobody ' s bothering to remember is ol ' ram prakash gupta .
apparently all bills had been paid as power consumption was low anyway .
an astonished gupta had to call up his successor , rajnath singh , for the bulbs to be lit again .

typical hysterical indian reaction to the one - day series against england ?
most of all , far too early to panic ?
in fact , not a moment too soon .
hussain , a curious mix of bottle and whine in india , said it over and over again .
on the other hand , these cricketers are worth at least a dozen runs in the field each , a skill not to be discounted .
but for a team which considers batting as its strength , this is a gaping crack and it must be filled in by the world cup .
after the hunters at the top - tendulkar , ganguly , sehwag - do their job , it ' s the gatherers who lose their way .
in fact , hussain ' s men had a poorer net run rate than india , scored fewer runs in the series and hit lesser boundaries .
even the three hunters at the top were guilty of fuzzy logic when the field spread and their boundaries got fewer .
even so , haq was captured 20 km from jalalabad .
he managed to send an sos to an american businessman friend in peshawar who in turn called robert mcfarlane , national security adviser to president ronald reagan .
mcfarlane contacted the cia .
nothing helped haq .
american hopes are now pinned on former afghan deputy foreign minister hamid karzai .
he represents the last senior non - taliban pashtoon who is still active in afghan politics .
intelligence reports say that nearly 2,000 taliban men crossed the durand line into pakistan ' s north west frontier province and the tribal areas .
delhi believes around 14 leaders ( see graphic ) in the former taliban administration are currently in and around the tribal areas and refugee camps near peshawar .
a large number of the taliban fighters have also been sighted in baluchistan , karachi , and pakistan - occupied kashmir ( pok ) .
other experts say over four taliban organisations have recently come up in pakistan .
the taliban is said to be regrouping at tshahi kurgam which is at the tip of the wakhan corridor in xinjiang province in china .
a significant number of the taliban have also used the baluchistan - zahedan route to move from kandahar , nimruz and helmand provinces into iran .
understandable , given the fact that washington is convinced musharraf will deliver on his promise to tackle terrorism on its soil .
pakistan was asked to emulate the uae example and deport these fugitives , 14 of whom carry indian passports .
a 1989 protocol on handing over criminal elements to each other may now perhaps come useful .
a . it is important .
he was emerging as the kingpin of a crime syndicate in india .
we have enough documentary evidence to show that he has been indulging in crimes in india .
q . given that sheikh is involved in the daniel pearl abduction , is there any possibility of a joint fbi - cbi interrogation ?
q . ansari had a genuine pakistani passport .
a . it goes without saying that the pakistani passport found in ansari ' s possession could not have been issued without somebody ' s patronage in pakistan .
q . getting a criminal from dubai without extradition procedures is unprecedented .
how did it happen ?
it was the result of painstaking efforts put in by the cbi .
the cbi team led by neeraj kumar planned the exercise meticulously and executed it with the finesse and secrecy it deserved .
also , the deportation was made possible with the cooperation of the dubai authorities and the efforts of our mission in abu dhabi and dubai .
" our country should n ' t be catering to america ' s needs . "
even more sensational than his indication of his motives was sheikh ' s claim that pearl had been killed .
" as far as i know , " he said , " he ' s dead . "
pearl ' s kidnapping cast a cloud over musharraf ' s first state visit to the us since he seized power in 1999 .
on pakistan ' s agenda were major trade concessions , increased monetary support , foreign investment and pushing for a greater international mediatory role in kashmir .
but the pearl case threatened to sideline these issues , at least as far as the media were concerned .
if anything , the us seems now to have gone a step further and linked a step - up in economic aid to a continued crackdown on extremists .
in 1822 she fulfilled her desire of building a church in honour of the virgin mary at sardhana .
built by anthony reghelini , an italian architect , the only blot in the church ' s appearance is that the approach does n ' t face the facade .
but the true faithful are known to look beyond the externals .
in november they come from all over .
" a quarter of the devotees come from punjab alone , " says father mendonca .
for roque albert , the church ' s security supervisor who is named after two saints , it ' s the busiest time of the year .
" queues start to form from four in the morning , " he says .
on other days visitors can take a guided tour of the church for re 1 .
on display are the vestments presented to the church by the begum in 1829 .
there is , in fact no single type of modern sari .
rama chandra krishan chandra , a once conservative shop in delhi ' s chandni chowk area , now stocks saris in delicate net with lacy borders .
look further and another traditional sari shop , the popular meena bazaar has " sari sets with innovative blouses by new designers " .
they now make their much loved kanjeevarams in lighter silks , keeping the tastes of their buyers in mind .
" the sari is no longer just a part of a trousseau collection , " says proprietor sanjeev manglani .
but there is still huge opposition from vested interests ranging from cabinet ministers and senior political figures to ordinary workers and newspaper editors .
do you know why ?
quite simply we cannot afford this any more .
ali had claimed that bhalla paid him by cheque in return for a regular supply of cocaine between june and august 2001 .
the other user who issued cheques , businessman robert suri , has fled the country .
suri , who holds a british passport , is now a po with lookout circulars against his name at all major airports .
investigators have traced some of bhalla ' s cheques to the new delhi south extension - i branch of hsbc .
in police custody , bhalla admitted to having paid for the cocaine at least a dozen times .
bhalla ' s arrest is significant .
he paid ali for the coke and we have proof , and this is important evidence in the case . "
when is the best time to buy and sell in the stock market ?
the simple rule is buy when the market is down and sell when it is up .
a good hedge against such volatility would be a fund based on the price to earnings ( pe ) ratio .
the pe is the ratio of the stock price of a company to its earnings per share .
some fund managers feel that it may not be easy to restructure the portfolio .
however , pioneer ' s new offering has impressed even its rivals .
when the market is in a bull run , most of the money ( 90 - 100 per cent ) would be invested in debt . "
true , the pe ratio fund will book profits while the going is good without waiting for stupendous gains .

that translates into a mere 2.1 per cent rise in the average income of indians .
most of indian industry is in deep recession with sales and profits falling between april and december 2001 .
worse is the continued investment faminepublic or private , domestic or foreign .
that puts paid to any chances of an early economic upsurge .
to cap it all , not many are ready to believe sinhas words any more .
the question is : will sinha serve a full meal of reforms in his fifth budget on thursday ?
and will that meal be nutritious enough to take the economy out of the onset of an eclipse of recession ?
a tough poser to rattle any accomplished brain .

hindu nationalism and issues like temples and islamic terrorism can bring power within grasp but they are completely useless when it comes to running governments .
for this you need new ideas and a new kind of leader .
digvijay may not have been quite so melodramatic in his approach , but has worked towards improving access to schools and speeding up rural development .

the central government needed a total overhaul when vajpayee became prime minister but he chose to do nothing .
well , despite the gloomy news from the assembly elections , there is no threat to the vajpayee government .

q . the initial reactions to your budget have been very adverse and business sentiment seems to have been badly affected . . .
a . business sentiment will have to help itself .
i have done whatever i wanted to .
now it is up to the business sentiment to respond . . .
stock markets are bewafaa - there are a lot of factors responsible for their ups and down .
q . the economic survey identified stagnant demand as one of the main causes of low economic growth .
but the budget has burdened the middle - class with higher taxes and fewer exemptions .
that is what i have demonstrated in this year ' s budget .
but the revenue shortfall is largely on account of the income tax concessions that i had given last year in the budget .
q . you have been criticised for promising a lot more than you can deliver . . .
a . what is in my hands ?
take the case of banking legislation to reduce the government ' s equity in public - sector banks to 33 per cent .
it is now with the standing committee of parliament .
the budget is the budget of the government , not the budget of the finance minister alone .
q . the implementation of most second - generation reforms depends on the states . . .
a . yes .
i have clearly spelt out the role of the budget .
that ' s one way to provide incentives to states to reform .
the state that will reform faster will get more funds .
q . is the role of the budget and the finance minister getting limited ?
a . i do n ' t think so .
i think part b of the budget speech should be one - page long ( 12 pages in budget 2002 ) .
because everything should be so set that people do not expect ups and downs in the budget .

thanks to the pressure from the anti - ban lobby ( read shark exporters and some state governments ) , the protected list was modified in december 2001 .
the commercially viable elasmobranchii subclass of sharks and ray fish was downsized to include just nine kinds .
environmentalists are now crying hoarse at the centre ' s appeasement policy .
especially in the face of studies that showed a sharp fall in the country ' s shark population .
and ironically , the indian shark export industry itself .
at the hub of this fishy fracas is the elasmobranchs , whose hunting was prohibited by the july 2001 blanket ban .
that lesson has not been lost .
someone needs to spend bigger sums to make movies technically on a par with bollywood .
also a real regional star - someone of the stature of chiranjeevi , rajnikant or even silk smitha - will have to emerge to inject life into hackneyed storylines .
the films have to find audiences outside the state too , perhaps in madhya pradesh and neighbouring areas like nagpur .
only if the current enthusiasm is sustained can chhattisgarhi films hope to carve a niche like the one enjoyed by marathi cinema .
but the biggest international release of of warner bros will reach india only next summer .

so is spirituality triumphing where politics has failed ?
" the time has come for all brothers and sisters to come together for the resolution of ayodhya .
ram and lakshman , even though they had different mothers , lived as brothers .
just like them , all are brothers , the sons of bharat mata .
sugreev and bali , despite being sons of the same mother , fell out .
that should not happen again . "
" there is a reaction for every action ( godhra ) .
" i think so .
the media too should act to complete the work . "
but all those talk about the secular versus the religious . . .
" when there is no religion , there ca n ' t be any secularism .
that is why the very word secularism is wrong .
only religion can save the world . "
and what was it that brought you to this disputed politics of ayodhya ?
for jayendra saraswati , the spiritual has never been static .
it is dramatic and very this worldly .
his social activism is often in conflict with the lofty aloofness of the orthodox brahmin .
for good box - office measure , director kumar jay throws in a terrorist ( sharad kapoor ) and six songs .

the film incidentally dwelt on a girl left to fend for herself by an irresponsible mother .

gauri karnik , 24 , is no exception .
tanuja chandra has cast her in her next film sur opposite lucky ali .
chandra took her on board for her " prettiness and strength of character " .
seems like the crash course really helped .
it must also mean that they wanted revenge and blood - letting instead of justice .
we are told that those who instigated the violence in godhra were members of the congress .
if this is so , it would have helped contain public anger if these details were made known instantly .
why should we believe them now when they tell us that it was not the isi but the congress ?
it might go some way in easing the shame of gujarat .
february 28 was a day of collective mourning for the indian middle classes .
as if that was not enough , the surcharge on income tax was raised from 2 per cent to 5 per cent .
the angst is unabated .
" the middle class has become the sole milch cow for the government , " laments padmini sharma , a textile consultant and a mother of two .
others ca n ' t fathom what sinha is up to .
lakhotia now has to suggest less lucrative or less safe options to her .
" the government has not thought much about the older lot who do not have any social security in india , " he says .
a more substantive complaint is against the manner in which rebates have been withdrawn - all of a sudden with no pre - plan or road map .
that has left people like rama vaidyanathan , a professional classical dancer , in a lurch .
" i feel trapped .
if i had known the rebates were going , i would have invested elsewhere , " she laments .
historically , tax compliance has come down every time income - tax rates have been raised .
the lesson : remove exemptions , but combine that with a reduction in tax rates .
in this atmosphere , civilised discourse is as likely to be uncomfortable with acharya giriraj kishore as with osama bin laden .
it does n ' t matter if one bears a gun and the other a rosary - in the contemporary reckoning they are blood brothers .
even if indians ignore international opprobrium , their innate sense of decency and fairplay will not allow them to stomach the events of the past weeks .
they may or may not want a temple or a mosque in ayodhya but they certainly do n ' t want a return to golgotha .
due to a variety of reasons , the ram janmabhoomi movement became a mass phenomenon a decade ago .
the mood has passed .
it is no longer the number one issue on people ' s minds .
rather , it is the number one cause of fear .
that is gujarat ' s warning , for the killers of godhra , for the extremists in the vhp - for mother india .
three men armed with youth and bamboo sticks advance menacingly towards a man shrunk with age .
but just as the sticks come raining down , a radical change comes over the puny old man .
and in his movements are grace and rhythm that have sustained through nearly a thousand years .
a harmonious blend of deft moves , silambam is a defence skill now , a dance the next .
" i must have trained more than a thousand youth , " says selvam .
the steps are not too difficult " but some youngsters are so impatient that they want to rush ahead without knowing the basics .
perseverance is a requisite if you want to learn silambam " , says selvam as he readies for another round of demonstration .
this time , the combat is more furious .
" delayed reaction such as this can cost you your life .
now you know why you should practise regularly , " he admonishes the student .
born in puliyankulam village of sivaganga district , selvam started learning silambam at 18 .
he completed the basic training the same year under periyaambillai , a renowned trainer in virudhunagar district .
after serving under several established landlords , selvam took up a job in thanjavur to train the youth in the region .
he moved to madurai only about five years ago where he now owns a petty shop .
but the silambam expert refuses to dispense with his skill for propagating needless aggression .
" for me , silambam is the sacred art of self - defence and mind control , " he explains .
" it hurts me when i see it being used for violence or when it is performed on political platforms as part of the stop - gap entertainment . "
film club had done a similar job with rudyard kipling ' s jungle book .

it is not clear how many companies have violated their agreements .
what bothers him more though is the fact that a number of large companies operating in india will be out of the ambit of any detailed scrutiny .
that has a direct bearing on the issue of corporate governance .
foreign companies have often led the way for indian companies in adopting global corporate governance practices .
this peer pressure may cease after the companies get off the stock markets .
why have the courts taken so long to decide ?

in the coming weeks , praveen togadia is likely to become even more of a tv personality than he is .
the real goal , he says , is to replicate the " gujarat model " across the country .
academically brilliant , togadia was a favourite of his school principal .
where mythology is a computer game and the language of power is not sanskrit but english .
where scriptures of the vedic age are less influential than the country report in the economist .
suddenly there is blood on the highway : india has been ambushed by those crazy stereotypes .
godhra . ahmedabad . ayodhya .
an inferno of a train in which death has a religious identity .
a murderous riot on the street where victimhood has a religious identity .
an unrealised temple on a disputed - or non - disputed - land where history has a religious identity .
and a doddering government in half - control that has a religious identity , though the government itself may be too dishonest to admit it .
it is a dream , and dreams demand permanent deactivation of conscience .
in the evening of the last century , history intervened to expose the pretence - the lie .
familiar ghosts in religious robes staged a comeback and what followed was an intimate , violent assertion of identity - reaching out to the nation in memory .
as it was in the balkans .
and parallel to the post - communist eruption of religious urge , there was the rage of the crescent .
the neo - hegelian prophecies of the end of history were mocked by history itself , a history made furious by faith .
that bloody progression from ayatollah khomeini to osama bin laden .
there is no escape from the politics of faith .
there is no escape from the mad mahant , who is very much a man of the zeitgeist .
equally grave is the altering demographic profile of the state .
mohammed amin seth , a social worker from modasa , explains , " the game plan of the hindutva brigade is clear .
the state government claims it is aware of the problem .
" we are taking steps to create confidence in the minority community , " assures chief minister narendra modi .
but few are willing to believe him , given the police ' s record during the initial phase of rioting .
modi now faces an unenviable task : to propose an economic scheme for the regeneration of the displaced muslims while providing them with adequate security .
for compounding the muslims ' problems is the campaign calling for an economic boycott of the community .
in the present phase of the ayodhya movement , the eight worst cities listed above will have to be watched .
in gujarat , after ahmedabad and vadodara , godhra has traditionally been the third worst .
surat runs the risk of becoming a new casualty .
though historically peaceful , it had its first hindu - muslim riots after nearly 70 years in 1992 - 93 .
the tearing down of the babri mosque constituted the spark last time and the sprawling shantytowns were the sites of nearly 200 deaths .
surat slums would yet again need careful watching .
another low turn in hindu - muslim relations can only weaken the country , domestically as well as internationally .
the banks are only too willing to lend .
while women in orissa have unarguably benefited from the programme , there have been gains for local politicians too .
it was just as well for the chief minister that his assembly constituency was in ganjam district .
" it is about improving lives and empowering women . "
whatever the political motivation behind the scheme , the statewide campaign is bringing about unprecedented synergy among the women .
rita roy , a sociologist with the bhubaneswar - based utkal university , says orissa ' s women are finally beginning to forge an identity of their own .
for years , the women of panijia were little more than voiceless entities .
although illiterate , deo and other sangh members were clear that their children should be educated .
so they went about planning a school in the village .
while they provided the money for the structure , their men agreed to put it up free of cost .
with their rope units and brick kilns , these women are building the road to hope in orissa .
like most girls her age , 11 - year - old kavisha jagasheth , a schoolgirl from mumbai , loves studies and hates exams .
earlier , musharraf had justified pakistan ' s reversal of afghan policy on the grounds that it was necessary to safeguard pakistan ' s " national interests " .
he is now in the unenviable position of having to explain how they have been safeguarded in afghanistan .
apparently they have orders from taliban supreme leader mullah omar to withdraw from the cities and prepare for a prolonged guerrilla battle from these areas .
" this is the real danger for pakistan , " says salahuddin .
this will have an impact on pakistan ' s kashmir policy .
privately some officials may also hope that rifts will appear among the alliance ' s component parties in the bid for political power .
of course , there are other ways to keep the customer away from the counters .
net banking , for example .
most banks today offer customers the convenience of e - banking .
a customer can log on to the internet , access his bank account , even transfer money to any account without issuing a cheque , through e - cheque .
some banks allow you to pay your phone and electricity bills through the net .
wap - enabled mobile phones even allow customers to buy and sell stocks and shares while on the move .
the meteoric rise of the short messaging service ( sms ) has allowed banks to provide an array of basic banking services .
but there is a problem .
so banks have invested millions of rupees in setting up call centres that allow customers to speak to someone in case of a problem .
the change is as drastic culturally as it is commercially .
of citibank ' s five lakh customers in india , more than 40,000 are blue - collar workers .
students of educational institutions in manipal use icici bank debit cards to pay for photocopying , to buy books and stationery , even settle the canteen bill .
icici bank calls it the e - purse .
does all this mean that banks will now be manned by just a few senior officials and supercomputers ?
" the role of banks would be to provide a long - term investment strategy to customers , " says kudva .

anthrax overkill : among the many monsters of its creation that have returned to haunt the us , anthrax is one .

banks will need to tie up all these loose ends if they want to keep the customer satisfied .
the jagasheth sisters are not the only pre - teens with plastic money .

by the time kavisha is old enough to sign cheques ( 18 is the age as per law ) , there may be no cheques to sign .

after all , only four days earlier he had successfully tackled the vishwa hindu parishad ' s shiladaan programme in ayodhya .
but barely had vajpayee settled down , when he faced a verbal assault .
if they want me to go back to the sangh , i will go . "
the vajpayee government was smug enough to believe that the vhp was in no position carry out any threat .
it was only when vhp workers started trooping to ayodhya to attend the 100 - day - long purnahuti yagna programme in february that the centre woke up .
the crisis was subsequently defused , but the bjp ' s relations with the rss had by then sunk to an all - time low .
in gujarat for example , the rss is functioning in coordination with the ruling bjp which is alleged to have abetted the post - godhra riots .
in the ongoing campaign for the municipal election in delhi as well , the sangh cadres are out on the streets sweating it out for the bjp candidates .
sources say union ministers campaigning in delhi have been quietly instructed to refer to the temple construction in their speeches .
the bjp brass would rather that the rss stick to its cultural agenda and refrain from interfering in economic policies or administrative issues .
so it is to vajpayee ' s credit that he has resisted them .
in the process , though , it is doing us the unintended favour of exposing the ugliness of hindutva ' s underbelly .
but who is going to listen to those who justify gujarat ' s violence on the grounds that it was " natural and spontaneous " ?
it is now generally accepted that the bjp is unlikely to win any more elections .
part of the blame for this must go to the prime minister who has been for most of his term a weak and ineffectual leader .
but we also need to acknowledge that his government might have done a lot better if his hindutva pals had not been a permanent thorn in his side .

it was their karma .
while some in the village cultivated land , the rest were artisans following their hereditary occupations depending on the castes they belonged to .
these artisans were not paid in cash , but received a traditionally fixed share of the produce after harvest .
the self - sufficient lifestyle of the village community and its attendant features were not something special to this country .
they were to be found in other countries at a similar historical stage of industrial development .
the swadeshi spirit surfaced rather late in the day .
during the years following the first world war , many new modern industries came into existence .
but the problem of traditional industries still continues today .
they have now to compete with their indian rivals in an organised sector .
the decline of the traditional industry and the rise of the modern industry in india were neither simultaneous nor causally connected .
it is said that the company , starting in 1780 , spent large sums of money only to incur huge losses .
exports on private account were encouraged , though the company had a monopoly of trade .
indigo plantations developed under european control but not , like tea and coffee , under their management .
thus there were no european ' planters ' of indigo as such .
they merely advanced money to the growers and bound them for delivery of the produce at an agreed price .
in some cases , land owned by the planters was leased to the cultivators for growing indigo .
in course of time , however , there were many variations from this general arrangement .
prices slumped in the wake of severe competition from coal - tar dyes .
the price of one factory maund fell from rs 232 to rs 130 in 1912 - 13 .
the respite provided by the first world war was short - lived .
the planters made fortunes while the cultivators were reeling under the weight of inflation .
but , generally , the condition of the peasant deteriorated everywhere .
the indian tea industry suffered an initial set - back when the first world war broke out .
it resulted in the loss of russian market and shortage of tonnage . but soon the demand and prices picked up .
in the meanwhile , efforts were initiated to facilitate research for improvement in the quality of tea .
essentially a small - scale enterprise , coffee plantations did not create the human and social problems associated with tea and indigo .
even when the industry fell on evil days , and plantations were abandoned , there was hardly any human suffering .
labour requirements of the industry were modest and the area of operation , unlike those forbidding ones of assam , were characterised by a healthy , equable climate .
only a few big plantations used mechanical power for removing the pulp from the coffee beny .
demand for labour on coffee plantations was not steady round the year as it was in tea gardens .
temporary hands were drawn from among the agriculturists of the neighbourhood .
even among the permanent hands a considerable number sought supplementary means of livelihood outside the plantations .
large european joint - stock companies had 17,000 acres under rubber in travancore by 1911 .
india had imported , in the past , considerable quantitites of rubber across its land frontier .
but after the turn of the century , indigenous production expanded , making exports possible .
the size of the estates varied considerably , but the average area and the number of persons employed per estate was small .
mechanical power was not common even in the bigger plantations .
thus this infant industry was struggling to find its feet when the first world war broke out .
the plantations were , in modern jargon , agro - industrial activities .
it was a decade of pioneering work , demanding the best of indian engineers , technicians and common workers .
the western ghats were conquered in the early sixties , and the hinterland was opened up for bombay .
the story of the conquest of the ghats is in a way the story of the indian railways .
five per cent was a good return in the circumstances and did not induce economy or efficiency .
there was also no chance of competition from unguaranteed companies as long as the guarantee was forthcoming .
a uniform broad gauge all over the country would perhaps have been a luxury unwarranted by the nature and volume of the traffic at the time .
in the meanwhile , gold price was rising in the international markets , and government liability in terms of interest and loan repayment in england was increasing .
between 1870 and 1880 , about 2,000 miles of railways were added at an additional cost of rs 25 crores .
the government of india protested in vain .
conditions were propitious for the state take - over .
the secretary of state continued to favour construction by companies even by guarantee .
productive lines were leased to the companies and unproductive ones retained by the government .
if some railways were owned and administered by the government , some others were owned by them , but worked by guarantee companies .
the plethora of administering agencies is apparent from the fact that in 1900 there were thirty - three of them .
this ensured a certain degree of financial co - ordination .
under these circumstances , there could be no well - thought - out long - term railway development programme .
enquiries were constituted with a view to toning up the administration .
mileage owned by state and worked by companies 18,680
exchange losses were quite heavy during the nineties .
the railway contracts were made when the exchange was at is 10d .
in 1892 , the rupee - sterling parity fell to is 4d , proportionately increasing government ' s sterling obligations .
at this parity , the return on sterling obligations worked out to 5.43 per cent .
most of this capital came from overseas investors .
the railways ' net earnings on capital outlay worked out at 5 per cent in 1900 - 01 and at 6.2 per cent in 1913 - 14 .
this figure comprised some 8,000 europeans , over 10,000 anglo - indians , and the rest indians .
the railways were by far the biggest commercial undertaking in the pre - war years .
the war created a milieu in which the railway programme , policy and finance acquired a new perspective .
an adequate and dependable source of power is an essential precondition of mass factory production and of the extension of railways , and of other modes of transport .
in britain and europe , coal , steam and the consequent mechanical applications constituted the prime movers of the industrial revolution .
india was not endowed with plentiful timber , which could have been a source of industrial power .
in point of time , coal and railway development preceded industrialisation in europe , and again , railway construction followed coal mining .
in india , however , this sequence was somewhat reversed .
what is true of coal is also true of iron and steel , which came much later in the chain of industries .
during the decade 1897 - 1907 , exports increased from 2 lakh tons to nearly a million tons .
it appeared as though indian coal had a lucrative market abroad .
but , after 1908 , exports dropped and the imports increased , though the latter were still lower than exports .
this showed that the coal production was being outstripped by the needs of the coal - consuming enterprises .
the railways were still the main consumer , and their off - take of foreign coal was reduced to almost nil by 1902 .
there was a similar movement in the proportion of the coal consumption by railways as against the total coal output in the country .
indian coal was the cheapest available but , considering its quality this constituted no great advantage .
the price of coal depended on two factors : ( 1 ) labour productivity , and ( 2 ) properties of coal .
mining conditions were generally very favourable .
the seams were thick and the mines shallow .
it was about 280 tons in other countries of the british empire .
the degree of occupational risk , leading to death or injuries , was comparatively less in india .
the universally used system of ' board and pillar ' was wasteful .
coal was yet another industry founded , owned and controlled by europeans .
the process of ' indianisation ' was slow .
in 1911 there were in bengal fifty - three companies owned by europeans or anglo - indians against only six owned by indians .
the organisation and management of the companies came under criticism on various counts .
five years ago , the indian mission in kabul was evacuated barely 12 hours before the taliban entered the city .
the indian decision was swift with mukhopadhyay and his team being sent to afghanistan with a satellite phone as the only communication link to delhi .
the liaison officer ' s name was cleared hours before the team landed at bagram airbase near kabul .
this had a double disadvantage for the country .
the process of industrialisation , based on coal and steel , suffered and the industries sustained by imported machinery could not hold their own against foreign competition .
there were many ventures during the 19th century to start iron and steel manufacture on modern lines .
the first cotton mills historically , the cotton spinning and weaving industry , originating in india , migrated to other parts of the world .
but its home - coming in the modern times was considerably delayed .
the mill founded on the bowreah estate near calcutta , around 1818 , ought to be mentioned only because historically it was the first of its kind .
there was no further progress for the next thirty or more years .
the first mill in the bombay region , which in the years to follow established its supremacy as the cotton manufacturing centre of india , was established in 1851 .
but it went into production only after 1854 .
a dozen more mills were set up during the next ten years .
the policy of the government during the years following the crisis was one of protection and encouragement .
as we shall see in later paragraphs , the policy pursued by the government of india presented a sad contrast .
the progress of the japanese industry was not impressive till the eighties and , in quantitative terms , was far less than recorded by its indian counterpart .
it may , however , be noted that this was achieved through higher efficiency as well as through double - shift working .
the working conditions were not as good as those obtaining in the indian industry .
the excise duty on the handloom cloth was abolished , and so also the import duty and excise on yarn .
however , it was precisely in these overlapping categories that the excise levy sought to wrest an advantage from the indian mills .
the next three decades were years of steady progress .
the number of looms and spindles increased much faster , as can be seen from the following table .
this can be seen from the relatively more rapid growth of spindles and looms .
the efficiency of indian labour had increased , making it possible for the industry to diversify its output .
with a growing world demand for packing materials , the golden fibre industry was indeed bidding fare to becoming a gold mine for india .
but there is something more to the story .
initially , the exports of jute manufactures were modest as compared with those of raw jute .
on an average , about half the local jute produce was exported , but in later years the ratio was declining .
dundee was the major customer of indian jute , followed by germany , france and america .
the direction of trade in manufactures , however , was different .
the most common need felt periodically was restriction of output in keeping with the fluctuating demand .
the need was felt , therefore , to organise a formal , representative organisation to facilitate concerted action .
ten per cent of the sacking looms were also sealed for a short period in 1890 , and there was a moratorium on the expansion of spinning capacity .
conditions however soon improved , and another spell of prosperity followed .
in 1891 - 92 , the investment comprised rs 1.4 crores plus 17.57 lakhs .
ten years later , the figure was rs 4.35 crores plus 17 ' . 41 lakhs .
for the year 1909 , wallace estimated the total investment ( paid - up capital and debentures ) at rs 15 crores .
however , even though the share of rupee capital was growing , it was not as though the indians were getting increasingly into the ownership of the industry .
we have seen that the numerous efforts made to start an iron industry were not successful .
efforts were also made to organise leather and glass industries on factory lines .
the petroleum industry was one of them .
this industry was , however , confined only to burma , where it was a fairly old industry .
one of the important mineral industries that emerged after 1900 , was manganese mining .
india soon emerged as one of the leading managanese exporters .
in the absence of any local steel industry , all the output was exported .
the production of other minerals like zinc , tin , copper , etc . was either nil or negligible .
finally , a brief reference may be made to textile industries other than cotton and jute , and to paper and sugar industries .
in 1895 there were only six woollen mills employing 3,000 hands .
sugar refining by the traditional method of progressive refinement of gur was a thriving occupation , particularly in up and bengal .
it received a serious set - back in the 1890s , when cheap beet - sugar found its way into the indian markets on a large scale .
besides , there were numerous small refineries .
but there was no significant progress of the industry on modern factory basis till the 1930s when , under protection , it made rapid strides .
paper making by modern methods is also a 20th - century phenomenon .
but there were solitary examples like the serampore paper mill , which had a much longer history .
it was reported that in 1895 there were eight mills employing 3,500 persons .
there was no increase in this number for years .
this indicated a substantial rise in the capital invested over the previous years .
however , indian mills were facing tough competition from cheap and superior imported paper , and the prospects for them were not particularly bright .
what was the dimension and quality of industrialisation of over half a century in the country ?
what prospects did it open up for future growth ?
over three million people were employed in hand spinning and , particularly , in weaving .
in fact , the pressure on agriculture progressively increased after 1890 .
so , counting them among the industrially employed may be statistically justified but would hardly brighten up the employment scene .
the pace of urbanisation was slowin fact , stagnant .
it fell slightly to 9.42 in 1911 .
but it cannot be said that even this small urban population came under the spell of modern industry .
as it happened , the regional development of industry was most uneven and unbalanced .
the rest were consumer industries .
after ranade wrote , progress was further accelerated , and that would have heartened him .
but it was achieved mostly by further expansion of the existing industries .
the industrial pattern did not change in the next twenty years .
a new awareness came to or was forced upon the government by the situation created by the war .
the commission submitted its report in 1918 , and recommended in strong terms the urgent need for government initiative and intervention in industrial affairs .
the rehabilitation programme costing rs 150 crores , recommended by the railway finance committee was opposed by the inchape committee on grounds of financial stringency .
but during 1924 - 32 , the years of unprecedented prosperity , the railways found themselves with windfall surpluses in their hands .
they were in a hurry to execute sanctioned schemes .
after 1931 , gross earnings fell , while expenditure remained steady , thus raising the operating ration .
it went up from the pre - war average of 94 per cent to about 98 per cent during 1919 - 23 .
on the other hand , the imports of south african coal averaged around a million tons a year .
the indian coal industry had a small export market and it could have been preserved and enlarged .
in sharp contrast was the policy of the south african government , which extended substantial help to its industry in capturing foreign markets .
as it happened in most similar cases , if the government ' s policy was not positively helpful , the industry ' s conduct was not blameless either .
it lost the trust of the foreign buyer by exporting sub - quality coal .
the railway rates policy was also not oriented to increasing competitiveness of local coal .
a grading board was set up the same year .
all these steps had a salutary effect on exports , which showed an improvement after 1925 .
coal production and consumption increased steadily through the inter - war years .
apart from the railways , which continued to be the main consumer , the beginning of iron and steel industry gave a fillip to coal consumption .
except for the depression years 1931 - 34 , production continued to increase from year to year .
the price may be immaterial where power consumption is a small fraction of manufacturing expenses .
but , in power - intensive industries , it may become the limiting factor .
in bombay the unit price during the thirties was 6 pice , perhaps the cheapest in the country , and at that price steam was a serious competitor .
the munitions board calculated that under optimum conditions , it should be possible to make power available at 2 pice per unit .
this was in sharp contrast to the government ' s attitude to early railway construction .
though left to private initiative , government direction and keen interest in the railway development was very pronounced .
but , on the whole , the pre - war trends continued to operate .
the number of mills and spindles , both in bombay and in the rest of india , as also their distribution inter se remained stable through the war years .
the number of looms , however , increased by 25 per centan indication of further contraction in export trade in yarn .
thus the exports fell from 30.3 per cent of the total production in 1913 - 14 to 11.7 per cent in 1918 - 19 .
imports from japan were just 1.7 per cent of the total imports in 1915 - 16 .
they rose to 13.6 per cent at 4 million pounds and subsequently to 72 per cent at 27 million pounds in 1918 - 19 .
secondly , food prices rose steeply in 1917 , adding to the economic distress of the working classes .
pressures for wage rise were mounting , resulting in labour trouble .
the next few years marked a period of depression .
the exports of yarn and cloth continued to decline during the post - war years .
the tariff board , therefore , went systematically into the need for protection and reported on it in 1927 .
the board estimated that about 40 per cent of japanese imports competed directly with the staple products of indian mills .
this was in the case of goods of counts below 30s , comprising long cloth and shirtings and drills and jeans .
the imports of these categories from the uk were negligible .
here probably japan had expanded its exports to india , cutting into those from the uk .
and , as it often happens , wisdom dawned only when capital was lost .
anyway , the tariff board in 1927 was convinced , on balanced consideration , that there was a case for protection in the existing circumstances .
the industry was given fiscal protection , first in 1927 , and then this was extended or enhanced from time to time during the thirties .
g . s . hardy was asked by the government to investigate and report .
his report endorsed the view that there was an ' unfair ' competition from japan .
but by this time the fiscal policy of the government was in the process of undergoing great changes under the compulsions of a deteriorating economic situation .
thus the imports constituted an insignificant portion of our needs in respect of both yarn and piece - goods .
japan and china , on the other hand , gained impressively and supplied 56 per cent of yarn imports .
the internal demand was dull and the mills had to carry sizeable stocks .
coimbatore , kanpur , calcutta , sholapur , etc . , where labour was cheap and markets were in close proximity .
mill machinery was cheap and there nough second - hand equipment for sale .
they could not agree to any concerted action to or prices .
double - shift working was common to all
in historical perspective , its expansion phase was over , and an era of consolidation , technical improvement and diversification of output was ushered in .
however , the industry did fairly well through the twenties , till it fell a victim to the great depression .
the demand for jute goods was maintained and an increasing proportion of raw jute output was converted into finished goods .
of these as many as seventy - two were in bengal and of the rest , three in madras and one in up .
they had a capital investment of rs 17.50 crores .
there was near doubling of jute consumption by the mills between 1910 and 1920 .
profits were high at rs 11.65 crores and rs 12.54 crores in 1919 and 1920 , respectively .
the other centres did not aggregate even a thousand looms and 20,000 spindles and employed a mere 6,000 hands .
the indian industry compared favourably with its counterparts abroad which were mainly fed by indian raw material .
there were about 100 mills in scotland , sixty in the usa , forty in italy , twenty - eight in germany and twenty - three in france .
there were also a few mills in canada , brazil and japan .
jute was among the worst victims of the depression . not only was the initial blow severe , the recovery was painfully slow .
among our major customers were the uk , the usa , france and germany they used to buy the major part of our raw jute exports .

how will they respond after suffering under the most gender - repressive regime in modern history ?
will they burn their burqas in flaming heaps , or storm government buildings to demand jobs and better healthcare ?
capital costs were particularly high .
the next decade saw a great improvement in operational efficiency ; works costs steadily fell .
but the prices were low and the profits small .
the ordinary shareholder had to go without dividends during 1921 - 35 .
even depreciation could not be adequately provided for .
conditions improved after 1934 , but the tariff board found a need for basic modifications in the plant to keep it abreast of the technological changes .
the performance of the duplex plant had not come up to expectations .
the board recommended the adoption of modern open - hearth furnaces .
from the beginning , preference shares were given a significant place in the capital structure of the company .
the latter became a highly speculative script and remained so till they were abolished years later in the fifties .
thus the capital structure was further weighted in favour of preference capital which now constituted about three - fourths of the share capital .
some rs 7 crores were raised through loans .
thus the company was over - capitalised on account of the predominance of preferred capital in the capital structure .
apart from the steel plant , the tinplate company of india and half a dozen smaller enterprises constituted the complex .
and in 1937 a new phase in labour relations was inaugurated when a scheme of profit sharing was introduced .
attention paid to housing , medical facilities , education , etc . of workers ensured a stable and relatively contented workforce .
an eight - hour working day was introduced back in 1921 .
right from the beginning , the plant was conceived as a fully integrated one .
there was no doubt that india had a clear advantage in the first stage .
even at this level , their cost of production was less than half the cost in america or england .
the cost of production of steel , which was competitive before 1916 - increased upto 1925 , while imported steel was becoming cheaper all this while .
we have already seen that these factors were present in this country to sustain a growing iron and steel industry .
india not only remained a british arsenal in the east , as during the first world war , but it also turned into an active theatre of war .
the entry of japan in the hostilities brought the war to india ' s doorstep .
a programme costing rs 4 crores for the manufacture of armaments and explosives was launched in 1941 .
the ordnance factories , strengthened with the assistance of trade and railway workshops , started producing 700 varieties of munitions .
during the immediate post - war years , the ' older ' industries generally received a set - back .
india was a loser in terms of markets as well as skilled labour that migrated to pakistan .
the strain on the equipment increased as the war progressed .
the disruption caused by partition brought down earnings but not the expenses .
diarrhoea kills because it dehydrates and the body loses vital salts .
the body becomes weak , and in severe cases , the kidneys may fail .
statistics show that if 30 per cent of those struck with diarrhoea in the country use ors , 40,000 deaths can be prevented every year .
" ors packets should be part of a home medical emergency kit , " advises bhan .
it ' s important that the salts are reconstituted in the correct concentration - one packet dissolved in five glasses of boiled water .
ors can also benefit the elderly who are often dehydrated because they are slow to recognise thirst .

the volatile debate over the prevention of terrorism ordinance ( poto ) leaves me puzzled .
but this is india folks and for the average indian , the police already has draconian powers .
what happens to the policemen who execute these extra - judicial killings ?
nobody knows .
by the time they are brought to justice - usually after 20 years - nobody remembers or cares except the relatives of their victims .
this is not to say that we should happily support a law that gives the police even more power .
our problem is that we emulate only the easy stuff .
these things would take too long and require too much work .
so , why not place a ban on smoking ?
why , for instance , does the chief justice not consider fining judges and lawyers who allow cases to drag on indefinitely ?
would this not be more important than a ban on smoking in public places ?
what about the massacres of sikhs in 1984 ?
the congress , responsible in its time for a much uglier law called tada , is hugely exercised over poto .
fine , but would sonia gandhi like to publicly declare why she does not demand that those who killed innocent sikhs in 1984 be brought to justice ?
after our foreign minister graciously escorted them to kandahar in exchange for the passengers of ic - 814 they have gone on to achieve mighty feats of terrorism .

fast forward to december 2001 .
rollbacks are back in vogue .
imf , ncaer , cmie and cii trim their growth projections .
even the rbi declares that gdp growth could be as low as 5 per cent .
the corporate world feels it will be closer to 4.5 per cent .
india today looks at the myths and the realities of economic growth .
myth : the government and rbi say the economy will grow at between 5 and 6 per cent .
juxtapose this with the size of the country ' s gdp : rs 25 lakh crore .
this means an accretion of less than 0.4 per cent .
the question then is whether this is enough to trigger a revival .
myth : ctv sales are buoyant and signal a revival in spending because of the robust agricultural growth .
reality : during october , ctv sales went up only 6 per cent compared to last year .
very simply , the higher volumes have been achieved on the back of price cuts and squeezed margins .
the biggest in the business are struggling to maintain both topline and bottom line growth .
besides , only ctv sales are up .
the solution is simple . making people realise that is proving a great deal more difficult .
mirror pace : molecules that are mirror images of each other are called " chiral " .
medicines often have these molecules , and the wrong form can be harmful .
that is why it is vital to be able to produce each chiral form separately .
their work involved freezing matter into a new pure , coherent state called bose - einstein condensate .
myth : the government ' s plans to spend rs 58,000 crore over six years on roads and highways will help revive the economy .
reality : this is only partially true .
sure , in the long run the projects will boost cement and steel sales .
the roads project will require an estimated 2.7 million tonnes of cement , or 2.4 per cent of the installed capacity .
ditto with steel .
in the conventional sense though this is not true .
is this money going towards productive expenditure ?
no .
in the first six months of the current fiscal , plan expenditure has risen by 6 per cent compared to 10.6 per cent in 2000 - 1 .
this takes the real interest rate in the us , at price inflation of 2.6 per cent , into the negative range .
myth : flooding of imported goods is hurting the indian industry .
reality : in the past five years , imports have grown in single digits ( barring 1999 - 2000 ) .
in the previous year imports were down by 0.16 per cent with 36 of the 65 categories registering negative .
even in 714 items where quantitative restrictions have been lifted , import growth was just rs 247 crore .
this year ( april to august ) non - oil imports have grown but by just 6.7 per cent or by about $ 1.8 billion .
but south block evidently underestimated the power of the " babu " .
this year , having utilised even lesser , it runs the risk of surrendering an even bigger amount .
yet another reason cited by the ministry officials for the deferment in acquisitions is the inordinate delay in setting up the defence procurement board .
simply put , the board will reduce the number of steps that are taken to strike a defence deal without compromising on transparency and quality .
at present , the defence ministry and service headquarters have to go through 32 formalities before a decision on acquisition is taken .
the board is expected to facilitate officers from the department of defence , finance division and service headquarters to work together as a close - knit team .

a two - lakh - strong crowd witnessed 778 couples tie the knot - way short of the record that was sought to be created .
the only hitch , as the embarrassed organisers discovered later , was the presence of at least five child couples .
chimmanakatti ' s team apparently undertook a filtering process to select the 1,001 couples , 80 per cent of whom came from villages in bagalkot district .
but somewhere down the line , the stress being on creating a record , the organisers failed to block the child couples from being there .
" our motive was to help these poor people get married and ensure that they saved money , " says chimmanakatti .

pure gold is " 24 carat " but is too soft to work on .

since december 13 our political leaders have taken to holding forth on civilised societies and the manner in which " civilised " countries should behave .
the implication is clear , even to the politically uninformed , that india is civilised and pakistan barbaric .
he appears to prefer cocooning himself in the embrace of his bureaucrats who do not want any changes because of the danger that their own powers may be curtailed .
" we ' re scared , " says section superintendent s . m . joshi bluntly .
delhi , kolkata , and other cities witness similar scenes and apprehensions .
the fear is of anthrax , a usually rare bacterial disease that claimed the lives of two postal workers in the us .
the pair , suspected to be victims of a terrorist " bio - attack " , unknowingly inhaled powder mixed with anthrax spores present in envelopes they were sorting .
following the events in the us , " suspicious " packages have appeared around the world , keeping governments on the edge , and sending pranksters into gleeful overdrive .
in india , victims range from union home minister l . k . advani and family welfare secretary a . r . nanda to villagers in remote areas .
in less sensitive times , the incidents would have amounted to a black comedy .

if religion is so irrelevant in pakistan , so is our existence as a state and our demand for kashmir . "
though the police have failed to establish a direct pakistani connection , of late , fundamentalist islamic groups have been active in gujarat .
this is in keeping with the isi strategy of creating islamic bases in states bordering pakistan with pockets of sizeable muslim population .
in bhuj last week , several muslim leaders delivered provocative public speeches but the police refrained from taking any action .
a . we are aware of the general anti - incumbency feeling in the city .

a matriarch who had the trendiest colours in her wardrobe and on her lips .
trps rose maddeningly , creating a profusion of family soaps .
kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi became star plus ' flagship serial in 2001 , leaving behind even the amitabh bachchan anchored kaun banega crorepati .
kahani ghar ghar ki quickly filled the number two slot and there came a slew of more .
" in the soaps , the camera does n ' t move out of the house .
it is confined within the four walls , symbolising the status of the woman . "
instead of intelligently evaluating sons and husbands , these women tread the judgmental land of black and white .
sons are either a kalank ( blot ) on the family izzat ( respect ) or an adarsh beta ( ideal son ) .
no grey areas , thank you .
even the actors who portray the old witches in new robes agree that there is a reality jam .
" in the urban educated society , there are many interesting women who are grappling with numerous changes .
ironically , even the mothers - in - law who watch these serials and boost their trps find it difficult to identify with the tv shrews .
like delhi - based shashi gupta , 54 , who says her change from the ghunghat to western twin - sets , has been slow but steady .
" i am beginning to get over my possessiveness about my son , " she says .
so if the tv mom - in - law is neither real nor radical how do you explain the high trps ?
do people really love watching what they do n ' t want to be ?
it is after all the regressive behaviour of these moms on tv that is creating a success formula for producers .

musharraf , in his 62 - minute address , managed to do all three .
significantly , the speech ended with a domestic focus , with india mentioned almost in passing .
india was caught on the back - foot .
instead of the immediate and expected gromyko - style " nyet " , india was forced to wait 18 hours before giving it a " cautious welcome " .
by that time , india ' s friends in the west had given a thumbs - up .
rather than any capitulation , it was musharraf ' s " courage " that was being lauded in western capitals .

the tuition is free and many receive free board and lodging .
their demand was the government should " remove all obstacles " to the building of a ram temple at the former site of the babri masjid by march 12 .
the demand was first articulated at the dharma sansad - literally religious parliament - convened by the vhp in allahabad during the kumbha mela in january 2001 .
it had given the government time till march 12 , 2002 , mahashivratri , to facilitate the temple building .
in november 2000 , the parishad began a ram jap ( chant ) programme across the country as a preliminary mobilisation measure .

singhal asked the hindus to take on islamist extremism , not remain fragmented and to unite under one umbrella .
chief minister rajnath singh does not see ayodhya as a major issue for the bjp in this election .
having said that the bjp is not unmindful that the vhp support base is part of its political constituency .
the parishad ' s unending army of sants has been frequently mollified as was done on january 21 itself .
the acharya was protesting against the fact that , especially over the past two years , the government has barricaded much of the city of ayodhya .
this caused some discomfort to ordinary citizens . it also made it difficult for the vhp , or any other organisation , to pack the streets with crowds .
paramhans wanted these barriers removed before he began the march .
the barricades were soon removed .
the speculation was this would make the vhp ' s february rallies easier .
precisely what does the vhp want ?
so it wants the control of the 67 acres on the periphery of the makeshift temple .
a non - bjp government can more easily be labelled " anti - hindu " .
out of power bjp leaders may then be more inclined to publicly back the vhp .
now if only it was n ' t so tiresomely familiar .

that bt cotton had boiled down to a clash of interests was no secret .
led by veterans like sharad joshi and bipin desai , farmers threatened the government with dire consequences if it went ahead with its plans to destroy their crop .
even union textiles minister and mp from surat kashiram rana threw his weight behind their cause .
" clearly , it is the clout of the strong pesticides lobby which is responsible for the campaign against the seed , " says desai .
farmers who have used bt cotton swear by its virtues and are willing to prove their point even in court .
a group of 25 farmers have filed a petition in the gujarat high court against the centre ' s move .
" the bt seed has come as a blessing to the debt - ridden farmer , " he says .
he also warned pakistan to prevent further intrusions .
though india brought this to the notice of us secretary of state colin powell during his visit to delhi last month , the official remained silent .
this is precisely what is happening beyond the afghan capital .
another battle is on in the key western province of herat .
despite iranian denials , teheran has traditionally backed former afghan resistance leader ismail khan .
earlier appointed as khor governor , khan was shifted to herat after a violent pashtoon uprising .
the us has beefed up its military presence at the shindand air base to curb the perceived iranian interference .
it is in this scenario that afghanistan is interested in strengthening the uk - led international security assistance force to extend stability beyond kabul .
karzai ' s visits to the us , pakistan and gulf countries indicate that he wants more monetary support for the country ' s reconstruction .
his immediate aim , however , is to maintain peace in afghanistan and prepare for the loya jirga .
india believes pakistan will make it tough for afghanistan by playing the taliban card .
muller ' s dubai stop - over on his way back was no coincidence .
the sheikh chose to give credence to ansari ' s indian passport and not the false passport issued to a safeer mohammed rana by the pakistani authorities in lahore .
ansari ' s game was up .
for the uae government , deporting ansari was an opportunity to demonstrate to the world that the emirates was committed to fighting terrorism .
since september 11 , the uae had been under pressure from the us to curb the hawala transactions .
the uae action had repercussions on other countries as well .

one of them is of a seated begum sumru holding the scroll of emperor shah alam ii which conferred on her the jagir of sardhana .
after her limp suicide attempt the begum suffered the ignominy of being captured and tied to a gun carriage by her rebellious troops .
but always the child of destiny , she survived - even thrived .
to the end she entertained the most influential people of her time .
the begum even maintained a band of european musicians .
quite a life she lived - especially for someone who had once been forced by straitened circumstances to take up dancing as a profession in delhi .
and today the legacy of the remarkable begum farzana joanna sumru lives on in the church she built - one which has both history and spirituality on its side .
for , the presence of an increasing number of members in parliament is beginning to appear more a chance occurrence than a foresworn duty .
and it takes rare occasions like the december 13 attack to see an unusual surge in attendance .
while it is social or professional commitments which keep most members away from parliament , there are others who simply consider it a futile exercise .
they attend parliament once a month to ensure continuance of their membership .
how can we keep him from contesting when he is so popular ? "
malhotra too says his party mps are attendance - conscious as they know the prime minister is keeping a close watch .

bjp general secretary sanjay paswan feels the mps who do not raise their electorate ' s problems in parliament should be thrown out of the party .
thats why india today brought together six experts to deliberate on the state of the economy and the challenge it poses for budget 2002 .
jairam ramesh , an india today columnist and adviser to past prime ministers and finance ministers , moderated the discussion .
the two - and - a - half hour brainstorming resulted in some refreshing ideas and analysis .
that the government is on the verge of bankruptcy is beyond debate .
but the way to solvency is no more through spending cuts , its through higher income generation .
thats a departure from the past years when expenditure reduction was considered the key to cleaning up the fiscal mess .
the shift in thinking is not without reason .
in the 1980s , the government collected 10 per cent of indias gdp in taxes .
that ratio fell to 9 per cent in the 1990s .
not according to him .
" in future , a lot of issues are going to revolve around economics , " he says .
for the moment , he runs a trendy coffee shop in delhi with sister sarika .
now that he ' s joined up , will rama hang up her boots ?
" i ' m not old enough to retire , " the mother counters .
when in america , he decided journalist daniel pearl was alive and well and " victim " of a fundamentalist conspiracy against musharraf !
hours later , omar saeed sheikh , mastermind of pearl ' s abduction , was telling a pakistani court the american was dead .
the judge - he must be a cousin of musharraf - pretended not to hear .
on his part , musharraf kept to his " look i ' m so good " act .
at a public function , he chided cricketer imran khan - famous for his anglo - lahori drawl - for asking him to speak in urdu .
he was proud of his english , the general said , and would help pakistanis teach it to the chinese to make them better it professionals .
it ' s the sort of reasoning they specialise in musharraf ' s cute little madarsas .
appointed : hardeep puri , as india ' s permanent representative to the un in geneva .

though the high court granted a stay order the government wants to ensure dalit rights are not ignored .
so apart from the 20,000 jobs on offer this year the 5,500 posts to be filled through promotions will also be reserved .
those objecting to reservation maintain that this will lead to a situation where the entire administration will be run by reserved quota recruits .
the court order is awaited .
so where will the demand come from ?
a . i am sorry , the demand does not come from the middle class .
last year i had given lots of tax breaks to the middle class , but demand still did not pick up .
demand must come from the rural sector , where 70 per cent of the people live .
and that ' s where i have concentrated this year .
q . your last budget was hailed as a landmark one but this year there is disappointment all around . . .
a . last year , i set the roadmap for the second generation of reforms .
now it is time for consolidation .
q . how would you control the fiscal deficit in an economy hit by a slowdown ?
a . we have to ensure that our revenues pick up and expenditure is under control .
all that nair is presently looking forward to is a sequel to popstars : " ladies first , boys next . "
the ownership changed hands with the lowering of the union jack .
the conflict is old and so are the parties .
says mohan : " somnath just rammed the issue through .
written submissions of all those members who were not present were not even considered or read .
the so - called adopted report was not discussed clause by clause .
amendments proposed in the old report were not even considered . "
the cpi ( m ) leader refuses to " discuss standing committee proceedings " .
he maintains that all contentious issues had been thrashed out in a two - hour discussion .
" why should so much importance be given to standing committee reports ?
the government is not bound by our recommendations .
it can go ahead and do whatever it wants , " says chatterjee .
the fdi supporters have now written to prime minister a . b . vajpayee and information and broadcasting minister sushma swaraj not to entertain the committee ' s recommendations .
entrenched newspapers thus get the volumes as they drop prices , at a very high cost though .
the gains from advertisement comes much later , after the price war has burnt holes in the management ' s pockets .
fdi is regarded as a source of capital that can set right the built - in imbalance between the old players and the new .
the political class has been squeamish in tackling such an issue because of the entrenched media ' s clout .
bjp rajya sabha member balbir punj says , " the standing committee ' s decision is a retrograde step .
at a time when there is virtually no control on the electronic media , why should the print media be discriminated against ? "
this is a question that the government will find increasingly difficult to answer in the coming months .
ever hear about the paan vendor who provides his customers a stain remover to erase betel juice stains from their shirts ?
or the airline carrier that gave a flier five new shirts because the stewardess accidentally spilled a drink on his ?
these are not myths , just true tales about people who provide remarkable customer service in the most mundane of professions .
these people , and hundreds of others like them , would remain unrecognised if it was n ' t for a media organisation that prepares annual reports for corporates .
the diaries are designed to cater to a customer ' s business environment .
or how j . r . d . tata allowed his competitor in a race , aspy engineer , to fly ahead of him .
another compilation lists people who have made india proud .
mahatma gandhi , who was a hero to later - day leaders like martin luther king jr and nelson mandela , could not be excluded , of course .
but do they know that he so impressed adolf hitler in the 1936 berlin olympics that the feuhrer offered him german citizenship ?
the man behind many of the imaginatively etched stories has a prosaic explanation for why his " mission statements " tick .
" we are like a pharmaceutical company that sells vitamins to people . "
it regularly runs up huge bills at flea markets and second - hand bookstores .
the two men have broken very big barriers in just venturing out on the epga tour .
he broke the shackles of being the boy who had everything . "
it is the way the extraordinary stand apart from the ordinary .
atwal wanted to be back in the throng of the tough us circuit just like jeev who hacked out the first path .
the senior pro is glad for the company .
now there ' s someone to speak to in the same language , " he says .
there is a fractured verdict and legislators here are notorious for switching sides .
the congress , with 20 seats , heads the new secular progressive front comprising four parties .
the opposition 13 mla - strong federal party of manipur could prove a headache .
but singh , who had been elected to the manipur assembly twice before , is confident of putting a halt to horse - trading and infighting .
right now singh has a more important task on hand : fighting insurgency in the state .
after more than 150 dives and frequent snorkelling in the next four years , kulkarni encountered a mere five sharks .
of these , only one was fully grown , the rest were baby sharks .
a clear indication that the shark populace around the islands had dwindled - and drastically so .
the cmfri though admits that the government needs to " manage " marine species systematically .
the centre maintains that it made the changes keeping in mind the " socio - economic " impact of the ban .
however , species such as the grey sharpnose and reef sharks which are hunted in a big way have been taken off the list .
he adds that the hardest hit by the blanket ban were exporters rather than the fishermen as sharks form a small part of the total catch .
even in the past week , acharya giriraj kishore , vhp leader , said as much .
on march 7 , however , singhal repudiated that statement .
he promised to abide by the court ruling , a dramatic shift for the vhp .
this letter was handed over to the shankaracharya and , in a sense , became his trump card .
convincing the muslim side has n ' t been as easy .
almost all of them !
advani , fernandes , joshi . . .
so go the exclamations from those who are in the know .
swamiji , please wake up .
a door opens and divinity leaps out .
there is no religion in this . "
is religion let down by politics ?
" it is always politics that causes anger and violence .
the time has come for all religions - hinduism , islam and christianity - to unite to save the country .
let religion become more important than politics .
only then will politicians see the light . "
you met quite a few .
could you make them wiser ?
there are shankaracharya watchers who believe that jayendra saraswati ' s dramatic disappearance for three weeks from kanchipuram in 1987 was a kind of protest against puritanical pressures .
a close devotee reads the seer ' s mind : " i ca n ' t appease everyone .
i do what i think is right . "
today it looks like every player in the disruptive ramleela at ayodhya is appeased , for swami jayendra saraswati is doing what sober india thinks is right .
the couple are not taking calls , but sources close to haasan say sarika made the first move .
after the incessant tv clips of terrorists storming parliament , there will now be a 70 mm interpretation called sansad .
we have not even learnt to distinguish between a communal riot and a pogrom .
in 1984 what we saw were organised pogroms against sikhs and in gujarat what we have just seen are organised pogroms against muslims .
riots are a different thing altogether and it is important that we make a distinction .
one of the key assumptions of tax reforms in the 1990s was that low tax rates are good for both : people and the government .
sinha has altered that assumption .
tax administration , of course , is n ' t yet efficient .
also , there will now be tax deduction at source .
there is another good news that only a few want to hear right now .
" we will move away from our mental block of investing just to save tax , " admits kamesh .
" the government has brought about long - term thinking by law , " says dhirendra kumar , director , value research .
once again religious violence is searing the land .
once again the economy is in the doldrums .
once again pessimism and hopelessness are having a field day .
there is one profound difference between the world of a dozen years ago and today .
especially after september 11 , 2001 , the global community is less tolerant of religious bigotry and the violence it foments .
swinging into action , vyas posed as a muslim cattle trader and arrived at the tankaria mosque .
the notice board confirmed his worst fears .
he immediately informed the police .
on d - day , however , the 40 - constable force was no match for the villagers who went ahead with the ritual slaughter .
the police were challenged by stone - pelting mobs and had to open fire .
vyas managed to capture everything on video .
the state government employees have 171 days - almost six months - off in a year , with a smashing 10 - day durga puja holiday as the highlight .
" ten days might be too long , but it ' s a tradition . "
there is another tradition that bhattacharya is unable to break .
his order that all employees report to work by 10 in the morning fell on deaf ears .
but that too is only for 194 days in a year .
state employees get 30 days of earned leave , 14 days of casual leave and 21 notified holidays .
add 104 saturdays and sundays to the list and that amounts to half the year off .
next come the restricted holidays .
several incidents in the recent past do appear to link the madarsas with the jehad movement .
investigation revealed that he had received the consignment from one kifayatullah , alleged to be an isi - controlled operative .
" the deoband school has even supported india ' s freedom movement . "
vishwa hindu parishad international general secretary pravin togadia claims this " jehadi virus " has resulted in the current upsurge against the muslim community .
admits minister of state for home gordhan jhadaphiya : " after godhra , there are several lessons to be learnt . "
many more to be unlearnt too .
so d ' souza took the chop and says , " they looked for a scapegoat and found one .
it ' s okay with me . "
english coach malcolm wood said mournfully , " if you ever pray , pray for indian hockey now . "
only divine intervention could have helped the indians who after a disastrous start , were left fighting for the 9th position in the cup standings .
drawing closer , he asked , " but where was the hockey ?
india was not playing what they should have been playing . "
jagbir believes it is time to look deeper and further .
" most of the players have not even played domestic matches .
do we even have a domestic league from where we can pick performers for the team ? "
the chief minister is happy to report , " some employees are more secular than others .
all of them take the restricted holidays irrespective of their religion . "
if that ' s not enough , the ruling left front usually helps out with some bandhs .
like " moderate taliban " , " bengal ' s work culture " is a charming oxymoron .
chief minister a . k . antony is facing a joint attack from his own congress party as well as the rss .
the cause of this unprecedented alliance ? kozhikode police commissioner vijay sakhare .
first sakhare refused permission for the rss vijay dashmi rally .
on october 31 , he outlawed the congress ' jyothi yatra .
so congressmen went berserk and joined the rss in demanding sakhare ' s head .
it ' s the " after " that indian hockey lives for .

we need to know who was responsible and we need to know urgently .
and we need to know it next week , not in the usual 10 years it takes for inquiry commissions to submit their reports .
understanding why godhra happened and who was behind it is crucial to understanding the sudden resurgence of religious fanaticism in india .
this is a pretty twisted idea of secularism but that is how it has always been , specially when reporting ayodhya .
neither is acceptable and we need to be clear about this .
meanwhile , to return to that temple in ayodhya , is there no way of settling the matter once and for all ?
october 24 , 1994 : the supreme court rejects the single - point presidential reference on whether or not a temple existed before the mosque .
it upholds the ayodhya acquisition of 1993 .
february , 2001 : at the kumbh mela the vhp sets the deadline for beginning the construction of the temple for march 2002 .
travellers in pursuit of the antique enchantments of the orient added their own discoveries - awesome and awful - to the swelling opus .
gods with funny physiology in a permanent costume drama . the hindu as an overbearing character in karmic vaudeville .
crazy rituals and divine circus , not to speak of the snakecharmer ' s roadshow and the naked sadhu ' s nirvana rites .
the india of eastern esoterica was the civilisational voyeur ' s favoured pornography .
india has survived that image in prehistoric sepia .
where the new travellers from distant lands are not civilisation junkies but marco polos of the supermarket .
" that may have emboldened the thieves to try their luck in as big a temple as the lingaraj , " says a senior police officer .
but that does n ' t explain why the burglars spared other antique idols and the silver platforms on which the idols were placed .
could it be that one faction pulled off the mischief to malign the other ?
what is clear , though , is that the security around orissa ' s 3,000 - odd temples and archaeological sites is extremely porous .
to guard the lingaraj temple , the police has just four constables while the archaeological survey of india has deployed another two .
the special cultural theft squad of the crime branch comprises nine police officers for the entire state .
so perhaps the burglaries are n ' t much of a surprise .
in the past five years , 39 antique thefts have taken place across the state , and 25 thefts reported from temples .
" the numbers are still not very high , " says a police officer .
the new india has become the oldest india , inhabited by crazy hindus in frightening fancy dress .
truth , suddenly , has the shape of a trident .
they are haughty , foolishly vain , self - conceited , and stolid . "
passion plays of religion cannot be explained by stereotypes alone .
ideology , essentially , is an imposition .
its promises may be as ambitious as the promises of religion : a kingdom of justice , of love , of eternal brotherhood .
it is an enforced idyll under which the basic instincts of humanity are supposed to die away .
the much celebrated secular mind of nehru was a repudiation of everything that was religious .
it was almost marxian in its view of religion : the masses addicted to this particular drug ca n ' t progress .
the alternative was the concoction of secularism .
nehru laid a false foundation .
and his legatees , from indira gandhi to rajiv gandhi to narasimha rao , played out the worst religious politics on that secular foundation .
they wanted the hindu , they wanted the muslim , and they wanted communities to be segregated by - no , not barbed wire - ballot boxes .
it was the secular version of divide and rule .
the end of the congress century , like the end of ideology elsewhere in the world , coincided with the return of the nation dressed in religion .
clearly , the fires are not doused and the haze of communal hatred continues to engulf the state .
his actions have evoked strong reactions , earning him either fulsome praise or bitter wrath .
sixteen years later , the story of the 52 - year - old gujarat chief minister is exactly the same .

the outcry that followed saw him backtrack the next day but he had already made his point .
" they were able to get back their voices , " says sanjeev mishra , the current collector of ganjam .
tales of the ganjam women ' s success soon travelled to the neighbouring districts .
as profits trickled in , they began calling the shots .
they even roped in the police to teach the man a lesson .
to make matters easier , satpathy was now serving in the chief minister ' s secretariat itself .
using satpathy ' s expertise , patnaik soon kicked off mission shakti .
during the 18th century , currency and monetary disorders were frequent .
the weakness of the insulated village community forcefully showed up in the radically altered circumstances .
this started the process of totally altering the complexion of trade of the east india company .
an outstanding event of the century was the rapid decline of the indigenous industry in india .
in the early years of the century , however , the lancashire industry was able to hold out against indian competition only through heavy tariffs on indian products .
as it is often seen , one of the most harmful effects of foreign rule is the imposition of the ideals of the conquerors on the conquered .
the educated classes in india then promptly turned their back on everything indian and took to things european .
some of the traditionally famous and prosperous urban centres of industry were completely crushed under the weight of the foreign competition .
the london exhibition of 1851 , however , stimulated interest among the europeans in the traditional artistic handicrafts of india .
imitating their western masters , the richer classes in india too feigned a sudden fondness and taste for local handicrafts .
thus there was some kind of revival of the indigenous industry .
but , on the whole , it had a contrary effect due to ' indiscreet european patronage ' and a blind imitation of the europeans by the indians .
the handicraft industry had fallen on evil days many years before the beginning of the factory system based on machine production .
the factory system must be regarded as a symbol of modern industrial organisation .
but individual artisans working directly for the market was the rule .
business carried with it a social stigma and the businessman ' s place in society was not particularly high .
no information was forthcoming from private owners regarding the order of their investment .
the coffee plant is said to have been introduced into india in the 16th century by a pilgrim from arabia .
in bengal , some 4,000 acres were under coffee in 1830 , but the results were not encouraging .
subhash lost on both counts .
sadhu , unlike what his name suggests , is n ' t one to renounce worldly pleasures .
there has been of late around the government of shri atal bihari vajpayee the atmosphere of a sinking ship .
her contribution to the promotion of art and culture was immense and priceless . "
is vajpayee on the verge of joining the congress party under the leadership of sonia gandhi ?
how else to explain his words of needless praise ?
they were not subjected to the regulations applicable to industrial units .
thus they enjoyed considerable freedom in management and over their labour force .
there was a positive side too .
they opened up huge wastelands hitherto out of bounds for cultivation .
while about 90 per cent of tea output was exported , almost all the coffee and rubber production was earmarked for export .
indigo , the old timer , was still leading in 1882 - 83 , the value of its exports in that year being rs 3.9 crores .
the guarantee agreements with the two railway companies were signed the next year .
and the first ' iron horse ' trotted between bombay and thana in 1853 .
the bombay - thana line was followed by the calcutta - raniganj line in 1854 , and the madras - arkonam line in 1856 .
it was a decade of pioneering work , demanding the best of indian engineers , technicians and common workers .
the western ghats were conquered in the early sixties , and the hinterland was opened up for bombay .
the story of the conquest of the ghats is in a way the story of the indian railways .
five per cent was a good return in the circumstances and did not induce economy or efficiency .
there was also no chance of competition from unguaranteed companies as long as the guarantee was forthcoming .
the railways , however , provided a great boost to the plantations .
one of the express objects of rail / building was the prevention of famines , and the railways did succeed in mitigating the rigours of famines .
thus there is no doubt that the railways played a significant role in the economic transition leading to the commercial revolution in the country .
the progress , however , continued to be slow until the jute mills of calcutta were started .
after 1860 , the progress of the coal industry became rapid and prosperity was ensured .
the opening of the calcutta - raniganj railway line in 1854 was timely .
upto 1870 , the raniganj coalfields were the only ones that had been exploited .
after that , new areas were opened up .
these included the mohpani area in the central provinces ( cp ) and the karharbari mines in bengal , both of which started production in 1870 .
the latter contained a larger proportion of moisture and volatile hydrocarbons .
but they had a particularly low ash content and a high calorific value .
ash and moisture are the two deficiencies of coal , and they were rather high and varying in indian coal .
ash content averaged between 10 and 30 per cent compared with just 3 per cent in england .
these deficiencies underlined the difficulty of getting enough coking coal which would be the basis of the metallurgical industries .
in 1854 , the east india iron company was formed to take over these works .
all these ventures proved failures in spite of the high quality of local iron ores and the admitted sincerity , dedication and perseverance of the promoters .
the futility of small - scale production using charcoal as fuel was all the more forcefully exposed by these developments .
it had a long and chequered career , but met with reasonable success in the end .
the company , formed in 1874 , put up its works at kulti .
it had two furnaces with a daily production capacity each of 20 tons of pig iron .
production was on the whole inefficient and the cost of production high .
schemes of reconstruction involving heavy expenditure by the prevailing standards were mooted , but the financial burden was found too heavy for the management to shoulder without government assistance .
in the meanwhile , things continued to deteriorate till the works were acquired by government in 1882 .
the coke oven capacity was now 40,000 tons of coke per year .
the foundries turned out sleepers , pipes and other castings .
government was actively helping the company by placing orders with it .
accordingly , a prospectus was issued in 1907 .
the public response was overwhelming .
the cynical british official who had mocked that he would eat every pound of steel made in india had now to eat his words .
the significance of this event was not confined only to the tatas and the steel industry .
it instilled confidence and faith in indian entrepreneurs and industrialists , paving the way for industrial expansion by indians with local capital and resources .
it symbolised an industrial break - through for a country which was hopelessly struggling to overcome economic stagnation .
the tata iron and steel company , with tata sons &amp; company as its managing agents , started the construction of the plant in 1908 .
three years later , in 1911 , the first iron streamed out and the first indian steel was manufactured in 1913 .
thus was realised the dream of jamshedji tata , though he himself had passed away in 1904 .
india was then importing on an average over five lakh tons of steel annually .
its own production of pig iron was a bare 40,000 tons per year , while steel manufacture was non - existent .
with an original rated capacity of 160,000 tons of pig iron and 100,000 tons of steel , the tatas were assured of a ready market .
earlier the government had agreed to buy 20,000 tons of steel rails per year for a period of ten years .
the plant employed some 2,000 persons , the supervisory staff being mostly foreigners .
the original plant was rather an assorted assemblage of equipment from the united states , britain , germany and belgium .
that was the reason why there were " americans at the blast furnace , germans , italians and swiss elsewhere " .
the americans were in overall charge .
whereas the management and control of the company were exclusively indian , its dependence on foreign technicians exposed it to a certain weakness .
the blast furnaces had a rated capacity of 175 tons of pig iron a day each , but they soon averaged 250 tons a day .
a battery of 180 copper non - recovery coke ovens , with the necessary equipment for crushing and handling coal , was originally installed to produce coke .
the products turned out comprised rails of various weights , beams of several specifications , fishplates , rounds and flats , light angles and channels .
the entire plant was serviced by a foundry , a machine shop , a blacksmith shop , a pattern shop , a locomotive shop and a store .
weaving was an ancient art in india , and exquisite indian textiles , along with silk , spices and precious stones , were a great lure to the europeans .
but this ancient industry was eventually swamped by american cotton and the power - driven mills of lancashire .
so its rebirth in the form of modern factory manufacturing was to the indians a revival of the past glory with visions of a great future .
if trade brought the europeans to india , protection to lancashire was among the factors that tightened the grip of the british over this country .
this lent a political edge to the economic issues surrounding the cotton textile industry , which acquired on this account a deeper swadeshi hue .
the business leadership as well as capital for this industry was provided exclusively by indians , though technical know - how and skilled hands came from lancashire .
thus the industry acquired the character of a truly indian enterprise - the only one of its kind in the last century .
the great spurt in cotton exports virtually paralysed the bombay mills .
the seventies witnessed hectic progress .
during the last two decades of the 19th century , progress was steady and continuous .
expansion was particularly marked between the years 1885 and 1895 .
during the decade 1891 - 1901 , if the number of looms increased by 69 per cent , the number of spindles went up by only 52 per cent .
the imports of twists and yarn of lower counts from britain were falling , in keeping with the increasing domestic supply and the contracting demand from the handloom industry .
another change that gradually came over the industry was in the form of a shift in weaving in favour of finer counts .
here again , the factors making for this change were similar to those that contributed to the shift from spinning to weaving .
the demand for coarse yarn was directly related to the demand for coarse cloth which , in india , depended largely on the state of agriculture .
thus , if there were no chances of quick fortunes being made in weaving as in spinning , there was also no fear of violent fluctuations in demand .
but the output of the handloom sector had also to be reckoned with .
it is difficult to estimate this output with any degree of precision .
the following table summarises the contribution of the industry to india ' s foreign trade in the years just before the war :
the industry had an almost simultaneous beginning in both the countries .
the progress of the industry in japan was not as rapid as in india in the initial stage .
however , teheran apparently reminded islamabad of its links with the taliban and the killing of iranian diplomats during the fall of mazar - e - sharif in 1997 .
it is perhaps in light of this that delhi has kept the kabul cell directly under its control .
now over to mission goodwill hunting .
in the past three years marksmen from johri , 50 km from delhi , have won medals in national and international shooting tournaments .
seema tomar won a gold and a bronze at the 1999 kathmandu south asian federation ( saf ) games .
zakir khan and shweta choudhary won medals at the meeting of shooting hopes contest held at plzen in the czech republic .
vivek singh - gold medal winner at the asian , commonwealth , saf and national games - even got the arjuna award in 1999 .
the 19th century opened the era of free trade policy , which was promptly foisted on this country as well .
even those import duties , which remained unrepealed , were counter - balanced by excise duties which neutralised their protective effect , if any .
variants of this gene protect cells in the immune system called macrophages , which are the first to be attacked by anthrax .
the added weight behind compensates for this .
this evolutionary pressure to remain on their feet while pregnant spurred the growth of the fatty deposits .
health diarrhoea sipping back to life that diarrhoea is a leading child killer in india is tragic .
what is worse is that the deaths can easily be prevented .
a fifth of infants below five who die in india are victims of diarrhoea .
that should not be the case , is the verdict of an international conference on diarrhoeal diseases and nutrition held in delhi recently .
even as late as 1850 , the exports of handloom jute manufactures fetched over two million rupees in foreign exchange .
however , forces had been working for some years past which before long brought about a rapid decline of the industry .
the emergence of a powerful modern jute industry in europe was the main cause of this decline .
the crimean war stopped the russian supplies of hemp and provided a further impetus to indian exports .
no statistics of the area under jute for any year prior to the 1870s are available .
in later years , cultivation was extended very rapidly .
indians had a negligible share in investment , but none whatsoever in control and management .
the industry , however , produced only for export and , the world demand being unpredictable , there were vicissitudes in its fortune .
the reserves were so impressive , in some cases , " as would allow the payment of good dividends even though the mills should burn to the ground " .
it cannot , however , be said that the workers had any share in the growing prosperity of the industry .
between 1873 and 1892 , exports of manufactures and semi - manufactures more than trebled , but manufactured imports rose only by 39 per cent .
the pace of exports of raw materials in the same period was less than half the rate at which corresponding imports increased .
we have more specific and comprehensive information for later years .
according to the industrial census of 1911 , there were over 2.1 million persons employed in various industries .
under the montague - chelmsford reforms , the industries portfolio was transferred to the provinces which set up their industries departments .
they also passed the state aid to industries acts , under which they gave direct financial assistance to industries .
government control of industry increased .
export of some goods was banned , while output of some others was earmarked for sale to the government at contracted prices .
the supply and distribution of coal were regulated .
this was no great concession , but at least meant correction to the old policy of procuring stores abroad as a rule .
rajpal divides time between his work at municipal corporation of delhi dispensaries and the shooting range in johri .
" i believe in lighting one candle with another .
now people i have trained are imparting training to others in johri and other places , " he says .
for instance , farooq pathan , a former trainee , now coaches at meerut university and kuldeep tomar is the official coach of delhi university .
rajpal himself has trained the national shooting teams of nepal and mauritius .
he also helped punjab chief minister parkash singh badal set up a national shooting academy in badal village in his state .
fear of political and administrative interference has prevented rajpal from approaching the government for funds .
" i will ask for the government ' s help only after my trainees prove their mettle , " he says .
sai has not responded to his request for the adoption and upgradation of the johri rifle club .
a little incidental relief ensued when britain went off the gold standard in 1931 .
thus was gravely exposed the risk involved in having a country ' s currency tied to the apron - strings of a distant , unconcerned sterling .
while the principle of protection was being accepted and practised , efforts were under way to sabotage its effects .
the idea of imperial preference , which was mooted as far back as 1905 and then successfully resisted , was once again raising its ugly head .
however , not much progress was made in the implementation of plans contemplated in the twenties to construct numerous feeder lines to open up the rural areas .
this was followed by the appointment , in 1926 , of a railway advisory committee to safeguard the interest of the public , and to consider complaints .
however , there were no major changes in the rates policy .
the next year there was a permanent increase in all the maximum rates .
subsequently , there were certain reductions .
on the whole , rates ruled comparatively low in india .
experience had proved this in the case of first and second - class fares .
inland water transport was not important , but coastal and international shipping was significantly increasing .
india ' s foreign trade received a spurt after 1850 , and the opening of the suez canal gave it an unexpected boost .
india , however , did not have adequate port facilities and its few ports had to cope with a fast increasing trade .
a scheme costing rs 10 crores was implemented by 1919 , considerably extending the facilities at bombay port .
a similar , though less ambitious scheme , was envisaged for calcutta in 1913 , and subsequently through the war years .
india had a substantial ship - building industry and a fleet of ships before the advent of the iron or steel steamship .
india ' s foreign trade increased almost twenty times between 1850 and 1920 , but the country ' s share in shipping was reduced to a negligible fraction .
the coal industry ' s progress was on the whole satisfactory and quite commensurate with the needs of industry and the railways .
however , its peculiar geographical distribution made its product uneconomical at far - flung industrial centres like bombay and madras .
substitutes like oil and electricity , therefore , came into vogue .
a majority of the bombay mills had switched to hydro - electirc power , and the rest to fuel oil by the thirties .
this was also true of the whole of south india .
at the ports , oil was competing with bunkering coal .
certain sections of the n . w . and g . i . p . railways were electrified .
electricity was not cheaper than bengal coal , but it was clean and reliable .
the burma oil company was established in 1886 , followed by the assam oil company in 1899 .
the inter - war years , however , saw the beginning of a modest expansion of hydro - electric power generation .
the first ever hydro - electricity generated in , india was used to electrify the kolar gold mines .
but the first ambitious scheme for generation of power from water came from that great industrial visionary , jamshedji tata .
soon the capacity was raised to 40,000 hp with a capital of rs 3 crores .
the supply of power started in 1915 .
the first adventure having met with phenomenal success , there were many more to follow in quick succession , the major ones being launched by the tatas themselves .
the biggest of them all was the tata power company , with a capital of rs 10 crores .
the war saved the industry from the threatened recession and brought about an unprecedented prosperity .
this prosperity , however , came only after the initial set - back experienced by the industry , following the dislocation caused by the war during its early phase .
the industry lost its markets on the continent .
the tonnage available for export was considerably reduced , particularly for yarn export to china .
but there was a vigorous revival of the internal demand .
interestingly , for the first time in the history of the industry , the seasonal downswing in the demand muring the monsoon failed to make its appearance .
in the latter year , the share of the united kingdom had come down to just 25 per cent at 9 million pounds .
imports of piece - goods from japan also expanded but not as fast as those of yarn .
the imports of white and coloured goods also increased , but they constituted a small quantity .
all cloth imports from japan constituted 21 per cent of the total imports in 1918 - 19 , almost all the rest coming from uk .
however , these factors had their dampening effect only after a time lag .
production costs had in the meanwhile increased .
thus profits were being squeezed out progressively .
depression in the industry led to a demand for protection .
for this the bombay mills were themselves to blame to some extent .
the policy pursued by them regarding dividend distribution makes an interesting reading in such a situation , and constitutes an indictment of their attitude to sound financial management .
after 1922 , they declined sharply to the low figure of 2.2 per cent .
naidu will apparently consider the health profile while choosing candidates for various slots both in the party and the government .
that ' s certainly an incentive for party workers to shape up .
but naidu is not one to give up easily when it comes to training - be it of the body or the mind .
besides exhorting tdp members to be fit , he has urged them to hone their organisational and managerial skills and use the latest gizmos .
the last instruction has met with mixed results - some ministers carry palmtops on which they note down appointments that they do not keep .
but tdp general secretary lal jan basha believes , " all this is beneficial in having a youthful and alert party . "
their trait of preferring commerce to manufacture was more dominant in their mental make - up a hang - over of their past role as businessmen .
lack of enterprise also reflected in the absence of any deliberate effort towards diversification .
it transferred in 1934 half of the revenue from the export duty on jute to the jute - producing provinces .
a central jute committee was set up in 1936 for the study of the problems of the industry and for rendering advice from time to time .
this led to a voluntary agreement , which was valid for five years , restricting working hours .
by now , however , the war clouds were gathering and the industry was looking forward with optimism to better days .
nor was there any appreciation of the versatility of the weed they were processing .
other countries were experimenting with jute cultivation ^ and development of substitutes .
before concluding this section , it may be relevant briefly to refer to the cost of protection to the iron and steel industry .
it has been claimed on behalf of the tatas that the company more than repaid the nation for the protection it received .
it is not easy to measure in quantitative terms the success of protection .
their share in the total internal availability of iron and steel goods in 1914 was less than 10 per cent .
the tatas ' efforts to bring down the cost of production were on the whole successful .
steel production consists of two stages : first , the production of pig iron and , second , its conversion into finished steel .
the development of these new industries also got reflected in the number of companies registered and their paid - up capital .
to check speculative enterprise , capital issues control was instituted in may 1943 .
no estimates of fresh investments in industry are available for the war years .
this was in addition to rs 125 crores of imports of machinery for replacement purposes in the existing industries .
in the field of chemicals alone , including pharmaceuticals , capital worth rs 60 crores was authorised to be issued .
however , the broad sweep of the consequence of these two phenomena for the industrial structure may be indicated .
i think it will take time before most women feel free of fear . "
i wept in anger because i had been made a prisoner without having committed a crime . "
" it was as if there was a long pause in my life , " says said .
in fact , quite the opposite has been happening .
we now have a ban on smoking in public .
did the supreme court judges who imposed it think about how this ban was going to be policed ?
reality : the gdp cake is made half of services and a quarter each of agriculture and industry .
last week the ncaer forecast that the growth in the three sectors would add up to a 4.83 per cent increase in the gdp .
even this seems optimistic .
that is unlikely .
on the current trajectory , industry would contribute 0.5 per cent to the gdp pie .
as for agriculture , despite a good monsoon , growth is expected to be under 4 per cent .
each tank costs rs 14 - 20 crore .
the ministry ' s options for getting a better deal in terms of technology and pricing on future defence purchases have now widened with the us lifting sanctions .

scores of superrich nris are flocking to punjab with cash and clout for a hands - on encounter in the poll arena .
at least two nris are in the fray , while many others have pitched in by sponsoring candidates of their choice .
never before has punjab seen such intense jockeying for party tickets by nri lobbies .
the foreign influence is most pronounced in the dollar - rich doaba region .
the jalandhar , nawanshahar , kapurthala and hoshiarpur districts are home to 14 lakh expatriates and send 25 legislators to the assembly .
incidentally , the elections have conveniently been scheduled at a time when most nris fly back in droves for winter holidays .
his message : " unite and i will fund the campaign . "
his efforts have been in vain so far , but bains has not returned .
" i will be supporting only good candidates , " he insists .
perhaps more important than the expatriates is the huge funding - pegged at rs 50 crore - they have brought into the election campaign .
small wonder that tohra was the star speaker at hundal ' s inaugural election rally where his nri friends made up half the audience .
money is , however , not the only factor for the nris entering politics .
" their usp lies in the pockets of goodwill they enjoy , " says state congress chief amarinder singh .
one such influential outsider is paul sihota .
sihota has pitched in with donations of rs 7 lakh .
many expatriates have been cultivating a do - gooder image by nurturing their constituencies .
dhaliwal has contributed rs 5 crore to welfare projects in patiala .
" a finger in the pie of punjab politics will make the nris the catalysts of change , " he says .
on a less philanthropic plane , the nris ' political clout serves to further their business back home in the west .
but for punjab too , it may be the harbinger of nri investments .
that the nris already form a powerful lobby is obvious .

his ominous tone echoed pakistani concerns about the lack of representation of the majority pashtoon community within the northern alliance .
whatever strain the northern alliance takeover of kabul may put on pakistan - us ties , it has certainly put musharraf under immense pressure .
opposition politicians such as those of the rightist jamaat - e - islami are already criticising the general ' s alleged gullibility in putting his faith on the us .
" general musharraf will now be subject to severe criticism both within and outside the military , " points out liberal political commentator ghazi salahuddin .
thus , a number of towns were centres of specialised production of highly artistic or quality articles meant for royal courts , wealthy urban classes or for export .
many of these industries were in the urban areas .
according to sir watt , in 1906 , there were 31,827 plantations , employing 24,447 persons permanently and 46,044 temporarily .
among these were a large number of women and children . rubber
rubber , however , was a minor industry in comparison with tea and even coffee .
the imperial government operated its own plantations in assam , but the results were not encouraging .
the breakthrough came in 1900 , when the ruler of travancore successfully introduced rubber in his state .
during the following years , cultivation spread to cochin , coorg and malabar .
the prospect before the plantation industries was either certain extinction or limitless growth .
if indigo cultivation remained now only in name , tea was poised for greater heights of progress .
coffee and rubber were minor industries , uncertain about their future and perhaps , therefore , inherently incapable of substantial success .
among the factors which constitute the infrastructure of growth , some are economic while others are non - economic in nature .
we shall concentrate only on three major constituents of the economic pre - conditions which were directly and vitally related to the process of industrialisation in india .
the enterprising j . n . tata started the empress mill in nagpur in 1887 , and morarjee gokuldas launched his enterprise at sholapur at the same time .
during the first stage of the movement of the industry away from bombay , we observe a preference for centres within the bombay presidency .
there was one more mill set up at baroach in 1861 , and simultaneously the first ahmedabad mill was founded .
the first unit outside the presidency was established at kanpur in 1865 .
sholapur and nagpur had their first mills in 1877 .
the exchange crisis cast a cloud over the exports of yarn .
as a result , the pace of progress was somewhat slowed .
between 1900 and 1905 , only ten new mills were added .
conditions , however , improved after 1905 and , in spite of the general overall depression of 1907 , the progress was well maintained till the war years .
but the development of the petroleum industry was very slow .
petroleum resources were confined mainly to burma and most of , the output was supplied to the mainland .
besides these , there were oil deposits in attock , but they were minor in comparison .
assam showed distinct potentialities and was rapidly developed during the early twenties .
in 1924 , burma produced 253.4 , assam 33.5 and attock 19.2 million gallons .
the demand for petrol and kerosene was , however , growing fast and imports were increasing in sympathy .
while imports of petrol were yet insignificant , those of kerosene were substantial , internal output meeting only about 40 per cent of the demand .
when , in 1937 , burma was separated , the country was left with no oil - fields of any consequence .
dividends were paid between 1923 and 1925 only by drawing on reserves .
the extraordinary profits were given away in dividends .
they paid a high dividend in 1921 at about 61 per cent of the paid - up capital .
industrial development was spurred by inflation and scarcities , and not by long - term considerations of viability .
considerations of enduring availability of raw materials , finance , skills , market or of favourable location , scale , etc . were ignored .
the resultant development was bound to be lopsided .
war - time easy profits led to speculation , inter - locking of funds and general financial imprudence at the cost of the consumer and the shareholder .
guided by past experience , the industrial community was bracing itself for the post - war slump , which did not quite materialise as a world - wide phenomenon .
these were mostly in the form of delay in the post - war reconstruction programmes , coupled with unsettled economic and political conditions in the country .
unfortunately , very soon the partition of the country threw everything out of gear .
table 7.3 would give , at a glance , the effect of partition on the industrial economy of the country .

on the second narration , khan agreed to play the feisty villager bhuvan .
but finding a producer who was willing to invest in a rs 25 - crore rural period film proved more difficult .
khan , the son of producer - director tahir hussain , had promised himself that he would never produce a film .
with lagaan , he decided to break the promise .
of course , the question is what is lagaan ' s long - term impact ?
bollywood has always believed in " bhed - chaal " , a herd mentality that follows a successful formula without asking questions .
so will we see a plethora of rural sagas or even sports - centred films ?
perhaps not .
lagaan is too difficult a proposition to emulate .
three thousand people worked for six months in harsh conditions to create the film .
but will the bollywood director or writer , spurred by lagaan ' s originality and vision , let his imagination run unfettered ?
perhaps .

they won their third grand slam title at roland garros this june , almost two years after their second .
they will win more but cannot turn the clock back and hope to find the momentum they had when they were at their most majestic .
in 1999 , instead of maximising what they brought to the table together and treating the tennis court as their common ground , they turned it into disputed territory .
it was as calculated a choice as that step up the incline .
all india ' s champs this year will have to make similar choices soon .
while their achievements , happily in plenty , have been enjoyed and celebrated , it is those decisions that will tell us what they are really made of .

that made her the mata or mother , until the next person decided to do sanlekhana .

nineteen possessed men changed the course of world history on september 11 .
the scale of destruction that a hundred of them now in india could unleash is too difficult to comprehend and too terrifying to imagine .
the government sought to feed this delusion in september last year when it banned the students ' islamic movement of india ( simi ) .
only for the unsavoury truth to be reiterated when 123 simi activists were arrested in surat last week .
more significantly , it unearthed simi ' s hitherto unknown us connection .
suhel is also said to be in constant touch with badr ' s legal adviser in delhi , anees , regarding the funds .
a decade down the line simi is as active and its objectives as undiluted .
it will perhaps take sterner measures than an easily flouted ban to curb the fundamentalist fervour of a fanatic organisation .

small wonder : agni i fills a gap in india ' s missile capability
it may go by the handle of india ' s most famous nuclear missile .
for pakistan , however , india had since the late 1980s secretly prepared its mirage 2000 aircraft to carry atomic bombs .
agni i , as it was christened , has major differences from its longer range cousin .
apart from being shorter by 5 m - its current height is 12 m - agni i is powered by a single - stage solid fuel rocket .
this launches the missile at a speed of 2.5 km per second , enabling it to cover the distance of 700 km in just 10 minutes .
in comparison , a boeing 737 would take 50 minutes to cover the same distance .
they have also made the missile road mobile , which makes concealing and deploying it much easier .
and he attributed this to " heavy snowfall in kashmir and jhelum valleys " .
elimination of cross - border infiltration is one of the key indian " expectations " from pakistan before delhi takes a decision on lessening troops on the border .
as a result , india has linked troop withdrawal on the borders with " visible " improvement on ground .
another proposal envisages a regular interface between the intelligence and military establishments of the two sides .

most of his collages are simple , though some have a salvador dali touch to them .
he usually opens his lectures with a vedic chant and then invites questions from the audience .
the mind , he tells you , is like clay which can be easily moulded .
and the fresher the clay , the better the impression .
for balu , the medium and the means of communication are as vital as his message .
the effort is to go about it in a manner that is as unimposing as possible .
collages , he feels , are very effective in this respect .
as he points out , the very medium is significant because it is created out of torn paper and other material that is generally considered waste .
the concept blends perfectly with his basic premise that peace is a state of mind , it is what one makes of a given situation .
collage communication apart , balu also draws from a vast repository of insightful stories , anecdotes and verses to regale his young audiences .
american president abraham lincoln , he once related , was found polishing his shoes .

on october 3 , abhyankar flew to the uae to operationalise communication links between the agencies of the two countries .

there have also been instances when he has smuggled in drugs , arms and ammunition into india .
q . what about his links with sheikh ?

senior administration officials in the us privately say the time has come for musharraf to walk the talk .
the reiteration of return to democracy by this september was obviously an uncomfortable moment for the general .
but the us administration believes that it is an integral element in the long - term strategy of weaning the country away from the clutches of islamic extremists .
it fears that the political vacuum created by military rule would get filled by religious extremists .

breaking with tradition , patnaik had personally campaigned in the elections for the local bodies , virtually putting his and his government ' s credibility at stake .
rivals , however , insist that the probes are motivated , either to nail political opponents or to sweep contentious issues under the carpet .
take bijoy mohapatra , one of patnaik ' s strongest rivals and president of the orissa gana parishad .
a vigilance case was slapped against him for " misdemeanours " committed as irrigation minister under biju patnaik .
there are others who are unimpressed by patnaik ' s love of probes .
the raging discord over the probes may be disconcerting but with popular support to bolster him , patnaik is unlikely to stem his fascination for probes just yet .
charting the careers of his children aryan and juhi , who are soon making their film debut , is also a matter of priority .
which , of course , leaves little time for sundry errands .
like attending the lok sabha , where he represents the important agra constituency .
babbar attended the lok sabha for only five days during the 2001 winter session .
sharad pawar ( lok sabha ) party : ncp state : maharashtra attendance in session : 12 days
sahabuddin ( lok sabha ) party : rjd state : bihar attendance : 7 days
9 . s . s . . vaghela ( lok sabha ) party : congress state : gujarat attendance : 12 days
suggestions , however , are redundant in face of the nonchalance with which the mps play truant .
rules , after all , are meant to be broken .
uttar pradesh has long determined the fate of indian politics .
right now though there is an uncanny similarity between the politics of that state and the state of the indian economy .
the future of both hangs in balance .
only the stakes are very different .
in uttar pradesh , if rajnath singh loses mulayam or somebody else wins .
the sins of past failures are already showing .
as desired by the majority of the members , the standing committee secretariat was advised to put up a revised draft approving fdi of up to 26 per cent .
the members also decided to meet on the second day of the budget session to consider and adopt the revised draft .
on february 26 , a different drama unfolded .
then to the surprise of mohan and others , the 10 congress members voted to prevent fdi in print media .
the samajwadi party too did a volte face .
the about turn could well have something to do with the uttar pradesh assembly election results that has seen most major parties suddenly turn ambivalent on sensitive issues .
pro - fdi members are livid with the way chatterjee conducted the proceedings and accuse him of bias .
normally once issues are conclusively settled at a parliamentary standing committee , it is not changed .
the debate over fdi is as fierce as the stake is large .
india has one of the biggest communications industries in asia , with 6,830 english and 39,825 vernacular publications in the country .
with a cumulative circulation in excess of 120 million , the indian print media ranks fifth in the world .
the argument that the print media alone needs protection , they say , is specious .
the country has 70 million television households , half of which have cable and satellite connections .
tv channels broadcasting foreign programmes have viewership incomparably larger than newspaper readership .
fdi is permitted up to a limit in the electronic media , and the cap may be raised considerably as the convergence bill becomes a law .
the group has realised that the most remarkable stories are found where least expected .
companies this year placed orders for betw ` een 500 and 5,000 copies of the diaries , and each cost around rs 50 .
however , the diaries are not for sale in the retail market , which is how trisys sidesteps copyright problems .
after the initial diaries were circulated , trisys found itself flooded with orders .
a media consultant took several samples to a pr conference abroad , and called back to ask for more .
a bengal politician wants to distribute them among the mlas in his party .
" perhaps one reason for the demand is that about 60 per cent of our content is indian , " feels a trisys employee .
this diary item then is easier to relate to than a tale of gumption set in an obscure american town .
it also makes for good bedside reading .
his name is arjun atwal , he ' s going to be 30 on march 20 and he comes from kolkata .
shake his hand .
atwal had wiped his doubts clean in singapore .
not even the sight of the great faldo loping up ahead of him took his eye off his own game .
" if there was anyone who was going to beat me , it was me , " he says .
this winter , his first five epga events came and went without a top 10 finish .
two weeks before singapore , atwal seized the lead in two asian tour events , the hero honda masters and the london myanmar open , before letting go .
but all the time in his bones he knew that the exchange between ball and club was getting both smoother and sharper .
" i thought i was going to win this year and i figured it would be soon , " he says .
an epga title victory is an elusive butterfly ; as singh has discovered after five tough years on the tour .
performances other than those on the dance floor ?
druvpal godara , a hyperactive 24 - year - old forward who plays for the oberoi blues , is now almost a certainty for a handicap of six .
mcdowell ' s shamsheer ali , 20 , is a skilful stick - worker and gritty forward who topped with about 60 goals this season .
players make rs 50,000 - 60,000 per tournament .
" next time we ' ll probably include chandigarh as a venue , " says player and game promoter adhiraj singh .
good . . . the sleepy city needs to have more fun .
passenger fares , especially of the lower classes , will go up by 6 to 15 per cent from april 1 , 2002 .
it will boost the railways ' earnings by rs 910 crore as over 90 per cent of the total passenger traffic is in these classes .
prahlad kakkar , a prolific diver supporting the rmci , counters this .
kakkar points out that fishermen earn only 20 per cent of the sale value of a shark .
moreover , fishermen will be adversely affected when the marine ecological balance is disturbed eventually , not traders who could move on to other trades .
india is one of the largest exporters of shark fins today .
until then , the shark population in the country will continue to swim in troubled waters .
the atal bihari vajpayee government ' s attempts to negotiate a settlement to the ayodhya dispute are probably its most extensive diplomatic manoeuvre .
in contrast , mobilising international opinion against pakistan would seem a cakewalk .
the government ' s hopes are now pinned on swami jayendra saraswati , shankaracharya of the kanchi kamakoti peetam .
to the orthodox hindu , the shankaracharya occupies one of the most revered seats in the faith .
he embodies an honourable escape route for all parties .
the shankaracharya arrived in delhi on march 4 .
pmo official sudheendra kulkarni always seemed to be around , as did samata party spokesman shambhu srivastava .
every evening jayendra saraswati drove down to 7 race course road to brief the prime minister on his peace initiative .
the dispute in ayodhya relates to the 80 ft by 40 ft ( or 0.31 acre ) former location of the babri masjid ( see graphic ) .
in january 1993 , this land was acquired by the union government .
also taken over was a surrounding area of 67 acres .
the shankaracharya ' s proposal sought to insulate the 0.31 acre .
it had three broad components .
the vhp would agree to abide by the judicial ruling on the ownership of the 0.31 acre .
part of the shankaracharya ' s proposal was a rehash of what the vhp , led by its international president , ashok singhal , had been demanding .
the vhp had announced it would begin construction of the temple on march 12 .
the vhp ' s call to vajpayee to give back its 43 acres was referred by the prime minister to his law minister .
jaitley ' s opinion , it is understood , is not unfavourable .
it suggests that the government will be within its rights to transfer possession of the undisputed land .
the shankaracharya ' s formula is not altogether new .
not at this moment , for the goddess herself is gazing benignly at the posterior of a formidable mercedes , which almost blocks the entrance to the temple .
somewhere inside this mandir , the answer to the unrealised mandir is having its post - lunch seista .
so it is anticipation time inside the temple complex .
" oh , he had such a hectic schedule . . . you know , from four in the morning to 12 in the night .
yesterday was really bad .
how many of them !
which is perhaps why breathing life into the state ' s muslim community seems less of an option , more of an impossibility for now .
it is a community oppressed by figures .
of a death toll numbering 750 according to official records , but probably double that .
this last is the most forbidding .
for besides their homes , many thousands have lost their livelihood .
speculation is rife on the reason for the attacks on this section of the community .
they feel muslims want to benefit from secularism without making an effort to strengthen it .
a stage has come when the hindus are just not prepared to be at the receiving end . "
thakar believes there was rioting on such a large scale only because of a spontaneous hindu upsurge .
the vhp ' s alleged involvement in inciting violence was , therefore , incidental .
thakar ' s views find a diametrically opposing expression in some of the camps housing displaced muslims .
a man steeped in the rss philosophy , modi knew his natural constituency .
within the sangh , modi is immensely popular with the party workers because of his eagerness to commune with them and his ability to deliver .
but rivals say he is vainglorious and never misses an opportunity to promote himself , something quite un - rss like .
this perceived high - handedness was a factor behind his six year political exile from gujarat - he first offended shankersinh vaghela and , subsequently , keshubhai patel .
in rss circles , modi has another minus point .
he enjoys the good things of life : designer kurtas , expensive watches and the latest cell phones .
last year , when he returned to gujarat as the chief minister , there was a widespread feeling that modi had mellowed .
the one - time firebrand was seen to be soft - pedalling on his pet hindutva .
" he has become another victim of the vajpayee virus , " it was said .
the resurgence of the ayodhya agitation and the violence surrounding it raise two important questions .
what was the pattern of violence during the previous turbulent phase of the ayodhya movement ?
and what might one expect now ?
the 1989 - 92 period can legitimately be described as the peak of the ayodhya agitation .
whichever way one looks at it - national , state or local - it was the worst period of communal rioting in india since partition .
the previous high was in 1969 , primarily as a consequence of the horrific rioting in ahmedabad .
the worst affected states during 1989 - 92 were maharashtra and gujarat .
the city has 531 tanneries , of which tangra , or chinatown , has 230 .
they do their part of the job - of socking , liming , pickling , chroming and tanning - under the unwavering attention of a patriarch .
besides manufacturing facilities , clc has provisions for providing 40 million litres of water a day , a key input for tanning .
not only is the cost of labour a lot cheaper in tangra , but moving away from their loved ghetto will bring cataclysmic changes in their lifestyles .
the chinese run restaurants in a big way , and the english - educated new generation is moving into corporate careers .
plus , there is also the " benefit " of excise - free liquor .
there are ford ikons and honda accords parked behind the high walls .
" the tannery is the umbilical link between us and india , " says paul chung , assistant principal of don bosco school in kolkata .
the hakkas were driven from their original home in present day xianjiang province around 250 a . d . by drought and the invasions of locusts .
the " guest people " have forgotten most of the hakka customs and languages in the west but not in india .
till the day she heard of women ' s self - help groups in the state and decided to join .
the amount she wanted was n ' t huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home .
" we have n ' t become rich , " says dhal . " but the future looks brighter now . "
like dhal , there are many other women leading anonymous lives in the remote regions of orissa who are now daring to dream .
" it is as if a silent revolution is on , " says anu garg of the state government ' s social welfare department , who heads the mission .
garg should know best .
although a full - fledged campaign to form self - groups began only last year , the idea is not entirely new .
but unlike most children her age , she does n ' t ask her parents for pocket money .
instead , she just uses her debit card to withdraw money from the atm .
kavisha ' s sister urvisha , 7 , also has a debit card .
he banks from his house and even while on the move - through the internet .
ditto for p . j . b . noble , who works for a bangalore - based tech start - up .
noble and his wife anitha do n ' t have the time to go to the bank and stand in a queue .
they just log on to their bank through the internet or give instructions on the phone or hop across to the neighbourhood atm counter .
some nationalised banks too are shedding their stodgy images and jazzing up their services in a bid to keep up with the trend .
" customers are short of time and want to deal in their own time .
and the northern alliance ' s president , burhanuddin rabbani , has stated recently that the former king may return " only as a private person " .
on the positive side , the pakistan and the northern alliance may be trying to build bridges .
it is being claimed that musharraf received reconciliatory feelers in his meetings with iranian and turkish leaders who have influence in the northern alliance .
this would be of mutual benefit .
one criticism of pakistani policy has been that ideologically motivated intelligence operatives had made pakistan put all its eggs in the taliban basket .
all these political manoeuvrings are , however , based on the belief that the fall of kabul and other major cities spells the end of the taliban .
given the fluidity of the situation and mullah omar ' s calls for a guerrilla war , such a presumption may be too early .
in which case , renewed conflict in afghanistan would certainly spill across the durand line .
the rest of the party too is having second thoughts .
the simulated local demand was not backed by an adequate appreciation of the quality , design and workmanship or by a readiness or ability to pay remunerative prices .
the result was that there was a surfeit of cheap , crude articles which ruined the true craftsman and his art .
thus the artisans were reduced to the status of mere wage - earners and could hardly aspire to become master craftsmen .
bijapur , once at the peak of prosperity , lost its glory with the fall of the adil shahi .
so did golconda , ahmednagar and tanjore .
in the north , lucknow met with a similar fate with the fall of the nawabs of oudh after the mutiny .
his opinion on disinvestment was ditto .
it ' s just the sort of decisiveness the congress needs .
few are more remarkable than converting om prakash chautala into a self - appointed stickler for legislative propriety .
" my only regret is not having a good opposition , " he said .
" i have to act as a saas ( mother - in - law ) as well as a bahu ( daughter - in - law ) . "
well , for the chautalas politics has always been family business , has n ' t it ?
the company , therefore , turned its attention to plantation industries , starting with indigo .
it is not easy to demarcate the stages of industrial revolution in india as one would in europe or england .
during the next fifty years die factory system became entrenched in this country .
the year 1850 may be regarded as the watershed which marked this country ' s graduation to modern industry .
plantations preceded the emergence of the modern factory industry in india by some decades .
however , with the progress of machine production of textiles and the decline of output in the west indies , the european demand for indian indigo increased .
indigo cultivation thus did not mark the beginning of capitalist organisation in india .
in fact it offered little scope for capitalist development .
later , it encouraged planters by guarantees to purchase their crops and by advancing loans against future deliveries .
at this stage , the planters , in turn , ensured delivery by cultivators by adopting similar measures .
experienced planters from the west indies were brought to facilitate the adoption of the plantation techniques in indigo cultivation .
after the 1860 enquiry , however , indigo cultivation was forced out of bengal .
it shifted to bihar and up ( where conditions were not so oppressive ) and the new areas of the punjab and madras .
in spite of the troubled times through which the industry was passing , production kept on increasing during the 19th century .
exports also increased pari passu .
in the closing years of the century , however , german synthetic dyes appeared in the market which posed a serious competition to indian dyes .
in the background of a century of phenomenal progress , the result of this development was disastrous .
between 1896 and 1914 the area under indigo and its exports had a precipitous fall .
it dropped to a mere tenth of what it was eighteen years before .
delhi : the government ' s move to amend rajya sabha election laws removing the domicile criterion for candidates has unusual takers .
at a congress working committee meeting , nearly everybody endorsed the idea .
the sole dissenter was kamal nath , the only cwc member who has never sat in the house of elders .
nath should put his money where his mouth is and seek rajya sabha election from his state of domicile , west bengal .
patna : chief minister rabri devi ' s brothers , subhash and sadhu yadav , are at loggerheads yet again .
the subhash group is far from happy .
" sadhu has played his cards discreetly .
when he was made chairman of an assembly committee , he warned his supporters not to publicise it , " recalls an rjd mla .
in the best year , exports reached a level of rs 3.5 crores .
but , with the onslaught of competition from synthetic dyes , neither the indigo exports nor its production could retain 1 pound = 0.5 kg .
the extinction of this industry , with its melancholy past , must be viewed with a certain amount of relief mixed with the customary sorrow . tea
it constituted , by the turn of the 19th century , a staple item of trade of the east india company with europe .
efforts were made to import tea plants and seeds from china for plantation in india .
this monopoly , however , ended in 1833 , and in the following years vigorous steps were taken to explore the scope for tea cultivation in the country .
tea plantation turned into a mania .
the recovery that followed was slow .
the expansion of tea cultivation in bengal and madras was considerable but not as rapid as in assam , in the next twenty years , progress was rapid .
the total acreage rose to 284,000 acres in 1885 , and to 433,133 acres in 1896 .
acreage was in assam , one - fourth in bengal and the rest in up , the punjab , madras and travancore .
men and women were employed in equal numbers and children too found work in plucking operations .
on the manufacturing side , however , mechanisation was rapid after 1860 ; it was almost complete after 1870 . much of the machinery was automatic .
but labour had to be attracted from distant areas to inhospitable assam .
wages in the sixties varied between rs 2 and rs 5 per worker in assam .
in good times , a man earned rs 6 , a woman rs 5 and a child rs 3 per month . the factory rates were a little higher .
workers were deployed from the garden to the factory or the other way round , depending on the needs of the situation .
the plantation and the factory constituted one management unit although the latter came to be regulated under the factory act after 1922 .
the bengal sun was too hot for coffee .
cultivation was next tried in the south , and it met with success in the bangalore and coimbatore regions .
coffee had its share in the consequent prosperity .
in the meanwhile , however , many disquieting developments were taking place .
if the tea boom at the time burst under its own weight , the coffee industry received a severe blow from a dreadful affliction .
in 1862 tree - borers appeared , followed a few years later by the deadly leaf - blight .
the three together thus earned rs 9 crores , which contributed one - eighth of the total earnings of rs 72.6 crores from twelve principal items .
indigo exports improved in the next ten years , touching a high of rs 5.35 crores in 1895 - 96 .
at the end of the next ten years , i . e . in 1906 - 07 , the exports fell steeply to rs 70 lakhs .
and by 1910 , neither indigo nor coffee figured among the twelve most important items of export .
tea improved its position , earning an average of rs 13 crores during 1909 - 10 in a total of rs 192 crores netted by the dozen major commodities .
tea , coffee and indigo exports were characterised by the fact that their export was largely directed towards a single destination , viz . the uk .
the era of modernisation and expansion of the indian transport system may be said to have been ushered in during the fifties of the last century by lord dalhousie .
earlier in 1845 , two private associations , the east indian railway company and the great indian peninsula railway , were formed with schemes for railway construction .
but the promoters found it difficult to undertake their schemes without financial assistance from the government .
this came to be known as the guarantee system .
a staunch supporter of laissez faire , he thought that railway building was none of government ' s business .
he favoured private companies undertaking this work .
they charged a heavy commission , but neglected proper maintenance and development .
coal mining was a very loosely organised industry , though this was somewhat inevitable by the very nature of its operations .
iron and steel manufacture is the very foundation of modern industrial structure .
however , it too , like coal , did not keep its date in the sequence of growth in india .
india ' s economic development was basically a by - product of , and a supplement to , the growth of britain .
as a result , india ' s industrial development lacked logic and perspective .
this was nowhere more true than in the case of the development of the iron and steel industry .
india has also pledged one million tonnes of wheat for afghanistan .
the medical component of the liaison cell is expected to revive the indira gandhi hospital for women and children in kabul .
india has been running a hospital at farkhor in tajikistan all along .
during the taliban regime , russia , iran and india backed the northern alliance .
the only indian diplomatic contact with the taliban was during the ia hijacking .
the nineties , however , saw the beginning of exchange difficulties in the wake of a progressive decline in the value of the rupee .
so by the year end it was decided to bring cotton goods also under the levy .
but the outcry from lancashire was so great that the government was coerced into imposing a countervailing excise duty of 5 per cent on all indian cotton goods .
the latter was a symbol of the government ' s helplessness in the face of manchester interests and of utter disregard for the interests of indians .
there was a lengthy debate as to who was the sufferer because of the duties .
the manchester representatives argued that the duties , whether on import or in the nature of excise , only made the cloth costlier for the indian buyers .
the government , unable to satisfy either , had to readjust the levies further .
the most glaring examples of this related to the two sister textile industries , cotton and jute .
between the indian and england jute industries , there was a community of interest , both being owned by the scots .
it seems that jute as such was not particularly favoured for cultivation in india by the company officials .
the realisation , therefore , soon followed that jute cultivation on an extended scale could meet these needs .
handloom weaving of jute fabrics was an old industry in bengal .
the manufacture of finer cloth , which was a substitute for silk shirtings , was also not uncommon .
the rising demand for gunny bags , created by increasing food exports to europe , gave a fresh stimulus to jute cultivation and the handloom industry .
the bengal handloom weaver enjoyed a world monopoly in gunny bags and jute cloth .
thus began the history of the great dundee jute industry which , in the past , had been known for its linen manufacture .
by 1850 , dundee was making extensive use of jute .
thus was lost another indian textile industry to europe .
unlike the cotton textile industry , however , it was not too late in homecoming .
four years later , the baranagar jute mills came into existence , to which goes the credit of introducing powerlooms for the first time in india .
the man behind the transformation of this tiny village is a native who works in delhi as a physician .
but it was rajpal ' s decision to set up a 10 - m shooting range at his village that put johri on india ' s sports map .
started in the courtyard of a dilapidated haveli , the johri rifle club failed to generate enthusiasm .
the club started with four trainees , most of them children of rajpal ' s friends .
the turnaround came when two elderly women became members .
during her regular visits to the club - she escorted her granddaughter to the range every day - prakasho tomar , 68 , developed a fascination for shooting .
encouraged by rajpal and her own family , tomar started practising seriously .
soon her sister - in - law chandro , 65 , joined in .
this sharpened the conflict between dundee and calcutta .
the dundee chamber of commerce brought to bear influence on the secretary of state for india to institute an enquiry into the working of the indian mills .
but looms and spindles recorded impressive gains all through the years till 1907 - 08 , after which period growth was somewhat slowed down .
all this while the mill - loom and mill - spindle ratios continued to improve .
this was another reason why efficiency of the industry increased .
it enjoyed the economies of management as the size of each individual unit increased .
if the cotton industry produced mainly for domestic consumption , jute and jute manufactures were essentially export items .
with its monopoly in jute , india had a unique advantage in jute exports .
the jute industry earned an important place in the indian economy also for reasons other than its foreign exchange earnings .
thus the industry generated higher incomes every succeeding year .
however , jute was the first factory industry in which the initiative , enterprise , capital and expertise were so wholly supplied by the foreigners .
the control and management by foreigners was total and exclusive .
their number increased rapidly after 1890 .
rice milling , which had been mostly confined to burma so far , spread out to madras and bengal .
however , all these activities did not constitute manufacturing proper and were insignificant in the context of industrial development .
the engineering industry followed in the wake of the railways .
the dawn of the 20th century saw wider application of mechanical power , and small workshops , flour mills , etc . rapidly sprang up .
according to the 1911 census , there were almost one lakh persons employed in the railway workshops .
mineral production in the last century was confined to coal and gold mining , the latter taking the pride of place .
even as late as 1911 , gold mining provided livelihood to more than 28,000 workers .
however , more important mineral industries were coming into existence , not to mention the phenomenal growth of coal mining .
however , the figures may be considered fairly representative of the dimensions and the composition of investment in modern branches of the economy .
according to findlay shirras , the total capital invested worked out to about rs 800 crores in 1914 - 15 .
cotton and jute mills accounted for rs 21 and rs 16 crores , respectively , while the share of tea companies alone was rs 34 crores .
together with trade , transport and banking , etc . , the industrial sector ' s investment was less than a fifth .
the railways alone had about two - thirds of the capital sunk in them .
according to an estimate , the total foreign capital invested in india was rs 450 crores .
modern industrialisation was a new phenomenon on the indian horizon , and the industrial skyline was changing exotically , after stagnation of centuries .
however , shorn of its novelty , progress was on the whole slow and sporadic .
even in itself , the industrial structure as it evolved during the five or six decades following the great uprising of 1857 was not viable and balanced .
it was historical logic that the industrial revival in india was led by an industry producing for mass consumption , viz . the cotton textile industry .
thus there was no parallel progress along the entire line of industry stretching backwards from the end product to machinery making .
while coal was a solitary example of basic industry , there was no capital goods industry as such .
the commission observed that india ' s record of industrialisation was disappointing , and that it was necessary to impart stimulus through protection .
it did not formulate a definite policy , but recommended the creation of a tariff board to examine the claims for protection .
the recommendations were accepted by the government and a tariff board was set up in 1923 .
after all , what are the ' natural advantages ' an industry should possess ?
how is any industry to prove that it would not grow without protection , or that eventually it would be able to do without the crutches of protection ?
we shall have occasion to go into numerous case studies of its application and to examine the soundness of the policy .
the munitions board , set up in 1917 , was yet one more indication of the government ' s readiness to encourage indigenous production .
in fact , it underlined the need and advisability of the government undertaking active production .
the railway management underwent ' an almost revolutionary change ' in the twenties .
as we have seen earlier , the railway programme was subjected to the general financial exigencies of the government .
the acworth committee , which reported in 1921 , recommended separation of the railway finances from the general budget .
road transport development was quite significant during this period and gave rise to the phenomenon of rail - road competition .
the problem of co - ordination of the two systems and their proper development in the future engaged the attention of the authorities and the public .
the political climate was , in the meanwhile , changing rapidly ; it had important economic implications .
the culmination was seen in the government of india act , 1935 , which envisaged an all - india federation based on a responsible self - government .
political consciousness was now superimposed on economic consciousness .
probably this was a sign of the country having arrived politically and of getting braced up for the economic tasks ahead .
the inter - war years were characterised by near stagnation in railway expansion .
this was in marked contrast to the vigorous development of earlier years .
but it was clear that the vigorous and major phase of expansion was over by the early years of the present century .
railway workshops were geared to production of war materials . as a result , the railways emerged from the war much poorer in shape .
he sat down , and it was left to foreign minister jaswant singh to get him back on his feet , but the legs must have been hurting .
he sat down yet again with still a paragraph to go .
more than a thousand people have been arrested since the ban .

patna : who is the asli ( real ) yadav in bihar : laloo prasad yadav or his one time friend - philosopher - guide ranjan yadav ?
if ranjan is to be believed , laloo is a gararia ( shepherd ) while he ( ranjan ) is a khanti ( pure ) yadav .
maybe the cows can decide on this one .
the fitness conscious telugu desam party ( tdp ) president is putting party members through rigorous health checks .
this , he believes , is vital for the future of the party .
soon doctors will recommend measures and prescribe medicines to tone up the health of the 5,000 members of the party ' s general body .
its completion in 1927 raised the capacity of the tata companies to 246,000 hp .
this met the power requirements of bombay city and its industries , tramways and suburban railways .
mysore had two new schemes , raising its capacity to 89,000 hp .
the later schemes , like pykara and mettur in madras , were combined with irrigation facilities .
india had established , on the eve of the second world war , a capacity of around 400,000 hp or 3 lakh kw .
but power in india was neither cheap nor adequate .
hydro - electricity in india involved heavy overhead expenses in view of the seasonal nature of the monsoon .
the price per unit was five to ten times higher in india than in some of the western countries .
the conventional trade cycle was submerged under the impact of the rising prices all round .
the difficulties of imports from manchester , mainly of bleached and dyed goods , opened up a new avenue of demand for the industry .
in an increasingly seller ' s market , they were not worried over the loss of the chinese yarn market .
government too stepped in to reap its share of this prosperity through the levy of an excess profits tax and higher income - tax rates .
the speculation cycle now seemed to be set in the reverse gear .
the war years were a period of arrested development of the industry in view of the difficulties of importing machinery and stores .
it observed that the financial assistance provided by shipping subsidies must have been considerable .
moreover , it argued that state aid to industry was a universal phenomenon .
even then , it had to admit that the japanese exports had got stimulation in the past .
if so , such encouragement must have been a factor in enabling japan to get a hold in the indian market .
the industry , particularly the bombay mills , however , cannot be absolved of the charges of mismanagement , financial imprudence and a general lack of enterprise .
after seventy - five years of growth , the indian cotton manufacturing industry continued to spin lower counts , irrespective of the changing world and indian demand .
even the progressive ahmedabad mills had made only a limited shift to finer counts .
the bombay mills lagged behind in their share in finer categories of piece - goods like dhotis and bleached varieties .
whatever ' unfair ' advantages japan might have enjoyed , there was no belittling the rapid technical progress that country was making .
if an average japanese operative looked after 240 spindles , the number was only 180 in india .
the figures for the uk and the usa were still higher at 500 to 6,000 and around 1,100 respectively .
it could not be said that indian labour was inherently inefficient .
a lack of foresight and progressive outlook was evident in the failure of the mills to adopt improved techniques of production .
the tariff board found that they offered no solution , particularly to the problems facing the bombay mills during the inter - war years .
it is difficult to establish the comparative advantage of this arrangement ; but it is of some significance that the tariff board ( 1933 ) opposed preference .
there was popular opposition to it in india , leading to its virtual abandonment in favour of bilateral trade agreements .
in the meanwhile , in 1933 , the mody - lees pact was signed to govern the cotton goods trade between india and lancashire .
now imports were restricted to varieties not produced in india in the required quantities .
the tariff board was called upon to conduct the third enquiry in 1936 into the effects of tariff changes since 1930 .

his worst known nightmare is compulsory college education for women .
the decade before the second world war saw a modest but promising start of the powerloom , the hosiery and the rayon - weaving industry .
the jute industry was riding on a mounting wave of prosperity when the war broke out .
but the dislocation of trade caused by the war , combined with a bumper harvest of jute crop , had a depressing effect on prices .
they also manufactured more sophisticated products out of jute , such as shirtings , curtains , carpets and rugs .
finer varieties of jute were mixed with silk and wool .
the stalk of the jute plant had an immense potential as raw material for paper making , which was hardly being explored .
bleaching and dyeing processes had been successfully evolved , but the indian industry was not too eager to seize the opportunities opened up by science and technology .
the tata iron and steel company continued to be the only manufacturer of steel for the best part of the 1914 - 39 period .
the war broke out soon after it attained full capacity , and it made increasing demands on it .
during the period of the war , the tatas supplied to government 1,500 miles of rails and 3 lakh tons of other steel material .
the depression of the early twenties created a glut of steel and the prices went tumbling .
the estimate of cost too was far from that expected .
this meant an increase in interest and depreciation charges and higher capital costs .
the delay in putting up capacity also involved a loss of production in the meanwhile .
this infant industry , with a great potential , was struggling to find its feet in the face of great odds .
government came forward to safeguard the interests of the industry by passing the steel industry ( protection ) act , 1924 .
in the meanwhile , however , the depreciating continental exchange rates were partially neutralising the effect of protection .
so the company approached government for further protection , and the latter extended a grant of rs 5 lakhs by way of special bounty on ingot steel .
the protective tariff at 15 per cent ( and 10 per cent of revenue tariff ) was ensured for the next seven years .
however , soon there was a further fall in the world steel prices .
others eagerly await the chance to continue their education in the open and without fear of reprisals .
conditions for women are still appalling by international standards .

the demographics of kabul have changed , as many educated and professional women fled the country and many rural women with traditional backgrounds flocked to the city .
profiles of three such women :
myth : improved corporate profitability indicates better days .
reality : sales are actually negative in the first half of the year compared to a 7 per cent growth last year .
and if one removed other income , the drop in net profit would be 41.8 per cent .

myth : government is pump priming the economy for growth .
reality : the monetarists at the rbi tend to agree .
after all , money paid in salaries is in a way creating spending power whether or not assets are created .
small wonder then that even at these lower rates there are few takers among corporates .
if this was n ' t bad enough , some financial institutions are so risk - averse that they lend only to aa and aaa clients .
so the biggest beneficiary really of the interest - rate cut has been the government which now has access to funds at 8.10 per cent .
the loser : low and middle - class investors and pensioners who have been targeted for lower returns on their deposits .
myth : global recession has affected india ' s prospects and this year ' s gdp growth .
reality : there is a goebbelian attempt to paint this as the truth but it wo n ' t stick .

so what ' s new ?
( ntpc ) was therefore set up in 1978 to recommend a comprehensive national transport policy for the next decade .
the committee suggested , therefore , that transport planning should aim at optimum energy conservation .
in fact , there would be scope for expansion of different modes of transport as needs increased .
it is still the largest industry in the country employing about a million people .
during the quarter century ending 1975 the mill sector showed some signs of growth .
however , there was only a marginal rise in loomage from 1.91 lakh to 2.08 lakh numbers .
the fortunes of the mill sector were interlinked with those of the handloom and powerloom sectors in yet another and more basic manner .
the government set up the textile modernisation fund effective from august 1986 .
the fund provided for assistance of rs 750 crores over the next five years on considerably liberalised terms , including access to the fund for healthy mills .
it must not be forgotten that the mills must reckon with the two facts of lifesurplus capacity and competition with the powerlooms .
this is only to be expected as only they can have the ability to supply quality fabrics in an intensely competitive market .
fluctuations in the production of raw jute , low yield , cost inflation , labour unrest , uncertain demand and obsolete machinery are some of its major problems .
there has been no significant change in the number of units and their capacity over the years .
on the whole , however , capacity utilisation has been rather low in recent years .
during the last ten years , it has varied between 80 and 90 per cent .
this percentage came down to about 60 in the early seventies .
the industry faces many problems and its future will depend on how effectively and speedily these are tackled .
the indian sugar industry has expanded sgnificantly since 1950 .
the industry ' s expansion has taken place not only in terms of output but also in its regional spread .
this has lent a broader base to the sugar economy .
after the 1950s , the industry found a new and more prosperous home in the south and took on a new organisational appearance .
the policy of developing a cooperative sector in the industrial field has met with some remarkable success in the industry .
this was proposed to be achieved through setting up twenty - six new factories in the cooperative sector , eleven in the private sector and eighty substantial expansion schemes .
however , the very next year proved to be one of the worst in a decade .
the total output of sugarcane in any given year depends on the state of the monsoon as a substantial portion of the crop still depends on the rains .
but the plantings are , in the first instance , governed by the relative prices of substitute crops like rice , wheat and cotton .
the sugar policy which does not reckon with all these factors is not likely to succeed .
it has been found that the amplitude of fluctuations of area as well as production is less in the tropical belt than in the subtropical belt .
extension of cultivation to the peninsula has , therefore , contributed to stabilising output to some extent .
it recommended a rs 345 - crore programme of irrigation fertilisers , communication facilities , etc .
besides , it proposed a rs 90 - crore modernisation and rehabilitation programme .
the merger of uneconomic units was recommended involving a cost of rs 66 crores .
the sugar enquiry commission,1965 ( sen commission ) generally endorsed these recommendations .
further , it made valuable suggestions for the use of by - products .
however , there was no worthwhile follow - up .
the need for a firm long - term policy was stressed by expert committees for many years .
however , all this government help was aimed at keeping the yard breathing rather than , putting new life into it .
finally , in 1952 , the inevitable was accepted , and a government company , the hindustan shipyard ltd . , was formed
visakhapatnam was an ideal site .
but , in the absence of ancillary industries , the shipyard had to manufacture everything itself for its use .
the machine tool industry had not adequately developed , nor had the motor manufacturing industries .
the government take - over , therefore , did not basically change the economics of the yard .
the time has come to plan for a rational use of land and water , both extremely scarce resources .
there is a clear case for setting up a national commission on land and water use .
however , achievement was not always up to the targets set in the plans .
the shortfall was particularly substantial in the third plan .
the performance of the industry during the seventh plan period was much improved .
there was no production of newsprint in the country when the first five - year plan was launched .
the nepa unit had originally a capacity of 30,000 tonnes .
the demand for newsprint was increasing and there was an acute shortage in the country .
this was expected to continue even after the commissioning of the unit .
thus there was scope for further expansion .
as against the target of 27,000 tonnes , the production of newsprint in 1955 - 56 was just about 4,000 tonnes .
in the meanwhile , the demand for newsprint was increasing .
it was , therefore , contemplated that at least one more factory of the capacity of nepa be constructed during the second five - year plan .
during the first three plan periods the growth rates achieved were rather high and capacity and production moved in tandem .
this also meant that the new capacities created were taking longer to yield additional output .
as a result , capacity utilisation declined in later years .
capacity utilisation was around 90 per cent during the best part of the first and second plan years .
the tariff commission had , from time to time , recommended relaxation of the rigid price and distribution controls .
the government accepted this recommendation and announced a new price formula for cement .
the government also announced a package of short - term and long - term measures for the industry ' s revival and growth .
this saw the dawn of a new era in the history of the industry .
in terms of the new policy , a minimum return of 12 per cent on net worth was assured .
the sixth plan provided for expansion of cci ' s capacity to 3.4 million tonnes .
however , everything was not well with the corporation and even its projects in hand were slipping .
due to constraints of funds the corporation had to stagger even the ongoing projects , not to speak of starting new ones .
in the meantime , the track record of the corporation was deteriorating , production of its units was declining and losses were mounting .
so the government appointed a committee in 1982 to enquire into its working .
the corporation has been a victim of mismanagement , if not gross corruption .
rourkela ' s contribution , therefore , could be reckoned with only in the third plan .
mep was however , modified in 1955 , as were the other expansion programmes .
as a result the tatas had the mep dovetailed into a larger 2 million tonne programme ( tmp ) .
and the misw had a scheme to raise its capacity to 100,000 tonnes of finished steel .
the third plan continued the emphasis on rapid industrialisation , with accent on investments on capital goods and producer goods industries .
in steel the country had by now a nucleus for rapid growth .
the third plan set the target at 10.2 million tonnes of steel ingots , almost all the additional capacity being earmarked for the public sector .
it was expected that these expansion programmes would lower the investment per tonne of finished steel from rs 2,000 to rs 1,500 .
since , however , there was still an expected gap of 1 million tonnes , it was decided to fill it by setting up a new plant at bokaro .
the neyveli pig iron project was also included in the plan , which , it was expected , would pave the way for a steel plant in south india .
but there was no preliminary investigation conducted prior to its inclusion in the plan .
bokaro was expected to contribute 0.3 million tonnes of saleable steel in 1965 - 66 .
the third plan was ill starredwhat with two wars and three bad monsoons in five years .
even so , they averaged rs 100 crores ( pre - devalu - ation ) a year .
the techno - economic report was received by government in 1963 , but the collaboration proposal fell through .
this was followed by a round of negotiations with the soviet union .
finally , in early 1966 , the memorandum of acceptance of detailed project report on bokaro was signed .
( of course , half a century ago , american engineers had played a crucial role in the building and running of the tisco . )
if bokaro was considerably delayed , there were other proposals all in the private sector which did not materialise for various reasons .
among them was the tatas ' expansion programme .
but the company decided in 1966 not to follow up the 4 - million - tonne programme in view of lack of finance .
thus the steel programme was so designed as to create an additional capacity of 3.3 million tonnes over the period of the fourth plan .
however , as it turned out , no fresh capacity could be created between 1969 and 1974 .
nor was any progress made on the programme of expansion of iisco .
thus both capacity and production of steel remained stagnant during the fourth plan period .
in fact , production performance of the main producers was not at all satisfactory even with the given capacity constraint .
of the two mild steel plants proposed , it was only the vizag plant which was taken up for implementation .
consequently the capacity target was 14.5 million tonnes9.8 million tonnes for the public sector and the rest in the private sector .
capacity utilisation improved in the beginning of the plan owing to improvement in the availability of infrastructure .
midway through the plan , infrastructure constraints , particularly inadequacy of coking coal , affected production adversely .
a scientific advisory committee has been set up to advise on the initiatives to be taken for concerted technological development in the steel industry .
the committee would render advice on the development of domestic capabilities , design engineering and research in iron and steel processes .
but the revival of steel demand in 1970 gave them a big boost .
the government also encouraged them to expand output through the use of scrap which was otherwise exported .
as a result , the number of mini steel plants multiplied in the seventies .
but as many as 121 units were added the next year .
in the beginning of 1976 , there were 202 electric furnaces which were registered or to which letters of intent or licences were given .
the company has installed a forge plant to manufacture certain high speed and highly profitable types of special steel .
the plant with a capacity of 77,000 tonnes started production of special steel in the late sixties .
from over 34,000 , tonnes in 1970 - 71 , production increased to nearly 62,500 tonnes in 1973 - 74 .
the performance of the unit has not been satisfactory because of old equipment , and management problems , in addition to power and other critical shortages .
a modernisation programme has , therefore , been undertaken .
a scheme for balancing and optimisation of facilities is under implementation .
a comprehensive study was undertaken in 1965 for setting a special steel plant at salem .
it was decided in 1970 to go ahead with the implementation of the project .
aluminium is a versatile metal capable of diverse application .
at the same time , aluminium manufacturing is extremely energy intensive and power accounts for about 40 per cent of its cost of production .
the availability and cost of power , therefore , become critical factors governing the economics of aluminium production .
considering the small base of the industry on the eve of the era of planning , its progress since would appear phenomenal .
the output of virgin metal increased from a nominal 4,000 tonnes in 1950 - 51 to 7,400 tonnes in 1955 - 56 .
it increased further to 151,500 tonnes in 1971 - 72 .
during the early years , production was less and the demand increased fast .
it was expected to commence production in 1987 .
about 41,000 tonnes of capacity was added in the private sector .
while the capacity achieved at 3.62 lakh tonnes exceeded the target production was only 2.76 . lakh tonnes .
on account of power shortage , capacity utilisation averaged only 60 - 65 per cent during the plan period .
demand also slackened mainly on account of lower off - take from the power sector .
against the anticipated demand of 4.5 lakh tonnes , the actual demand was only 3.1 lakh tonnes , reducing dependence on imports .
the proposal was implemented when , in 1953 , civil aviation was nationalised and two corporations , were set up .
on the eve of the first five - year plan , there were seventy - two aerodromes under the civil aviation department .
in fact , the dependence on coal relatively increased for a time consequent on the loss of the oil produced in burma .
production increased and prices rose .
nor have they been able to absorb any of the technologies imported by them .
many technological changes have taken place in the interval .
many cost of reduction measures are possible , particularly in the downstream areas of rolling , extrusion , and casting of aluminium .
this expertise needs to be developed in the country on a priority basis .
application technology is another area for major r &amp; d effort .
aluminium can substitute scarce materials like wood , copper and brass .
in the transport sector , light aluminium coaches , wagons , tankers , etc . can contribute to considerable energy saving .
there is considerable scope for use of aluminium in the packaging industry .
as we have observed , aluminium is extremely energy intensive , and energy is a scarce resource .
but it is late in the day to open the issue except for future expansion of the industry .
during the years 1956 - 61 , a beginning was made in the production of paper , sugar and cement machinery and other engineering products like compressors .
the construction of the heavy electrical plant at bhopal was in progress , but its commissioning was delayed .
the third plan continued the emphasis on " machine - building programmes and the acquisition of related skills , technical know - how and designing capacity " .
output of machine tools increased four - fold during 1961 - 66 .
however , there was no decline in imports of machinery .
the output of machinery in 1965 - 66 was estimated at rs 500 crores .
the initial phase of vigorous growth of the machinery sector came to an end in 1965 - 66 .
industrial development decelerated in the following years .
the fortunes of this sector are extremely sensitive to business fluctuations and depend crucially on investment in the public and private sectors .
the growth rate turned negative during the three annual plan years ( 1966 - 69 ) .
besides , there were specific factors affecting demand for individual products .
the progress of the major industrial machinery groups is reviewed below .
the plight of hec has been particularly pathetic as it has been saddled with capacities which are either not utilised or are not suitable for our requirements .
hec , which symbolised the early visions of industrial take - off , has been reduced to the fate of an incapacitated giant .
hec is now undertaking a programme of product diversification .
they must adopt a consortium approach for taking up major contracts including systems design , process know - how and supply of equipment .
led by the public sector bharat heavy electrical ltd . ( bhel ) , the electrical machinery industry has made great achievements .
the real problem is one of adequate demand in view of the slow down of the power programme or import of equipment because of tied aid .
cement capacity and output have expanded rapidly since 1980 .
simultaneously , large capacity plants with modern technology are being put up , mostly in collaboration with foreign firms .
this called for , among other measures , ' electronification ' of not only the industry but also of transport , energy and services .
introduction of process control instrumentation , automation and computerised design activity on a large scale had to be undertaken if productivity were to be improved .
the plan emphasis , was therefore , on development of electronic components and materials .
there was to be considerable expansion and digitalisation of telecommunication network besides the already fast - expanding tv network and satellite communication facilities .
the seventh plan set the production target at rs 10,860 croresa five - fold increase during the plan period .
the sector - wise targets are indicated in table . 12.2 :
thus the plan envisaged a major shift in production in favour of control instruments , communication equipment , computers and components .
the share of consumer electronics was to decline from 31 per cent in 1984 - 85 to 20 per cent in 1989 - 90 .
the indian petro - chemicals corporation was formed in 1969 to undertake the implementation of the koyali complex .
the udey unit , which was commissioned in the early seventies was set up with italian collaboration .
it was designed to extract 109,000 tonnes per year of catalytically reformed gasolene and to manufacture 33,000 tonnes of benzene .
the rest is used for the production of polyesters , insecticides , detergents , etc .
the naphtha cracker and the downstream units were commissioned in 1978 .
the commissioning of as many as fourteen production units constituting the complex was unique in many respects .
it represented the culmination of the collective endeavour of indian and foreign equipment manufacturers , research organisations and technicians .
imports were virtually banned and consumption was restricted to domestic production .
domestic production of thermo - plastics increased three - fold and synthetic fibres sixteen - fold .
in recent years , the pace of expansion has been further accelerated .
petro - chemicals have now penetrated most of the important end - uses in spite of the various restrictions imposed on them .
in fact , there is hardly any area of economic activity in which petro - chemicals do not play a significant and often an indispensable role .
fortunately for the country , the prospects for expansion of the industry are fairly encouraging .
the discovery of crude oil and natural gas on the west coast and recently on the east coast has provided a new impetus to the industry .
the accent was on competitiveness , productivity and efficiency .
it was thus crucial to reduce costs on these downstream industries through improved efficiency of the petro - chemical sector .
r &amp; d programmes as well as programmes for training and technical assistance to the industry needed therefore to be greatly strengthened . production targets
in the private sector union carbide and indian explosives were closed down , affecting production of ldpe .
the shortfall was due to the slippages in commissioning schedules of haldia , hazira , paradeep , namrup iii , goa ( expansion ) and mangalore plants .
schemes of modification of equipment design and captive power generation were therefore undertaken .
the two coal - based plants at ramagundam and talcher were commissioned in 1980 - 81 .
these are the first such plants in the country and the second of this size in the world .
though the technology is proven , defects in equipment and imbalances in facilities , caused low capacity utilisation .
six of them would be based on gas , one on coal ( restart of korba ) and one on naphtha in the north - western region .
the economies that could be effected on transport , if coals were washed before hauling , were self - evident .
but the progress in this direction was slow .
the only washeries were the two set up in 1952 by the tata iron and steel company .
a committee set up in 1953 underscored the great benefits of washing coal , even if it meant reducing the ash content only by 5 per cent .
the indian bureau of mines , set up in 1948 , was empowered to enforce adoption of scientific methods and employment of scientific personnel in the mines .
the indian school of mines and applied geology , established in 1926 , was the solitary institution in the country imparting high - level technical education .
the turnover , therefore , of high quality research personnel was limited .
the knowledge of the composition of coal and of the factors that influence its behaviour when heated was limited .
the progress in the discovery of new deposits was also not very satisfactory .
the general index of industrial production with 1970 as base rose to 149.7 in 1979 .
thus , during the nine years of the seventies , industrial production grew by about 50 per cent .
thus , there was a slow recovery in the growth rate of industrial production since the end of the third five - year plan .
it marked an improvement over the growth rate recorded during the fourth plan period , viz . 4.5 per cent per year .
it compared with the growth rate for the entire period 1961 - 73 at 5.5 per cent per year .
it was , however , still lower than the plan target as well as the growth rate of about 9 per cent achieved in the early sixties .
in perspective , the five years of the third plan remained the high water mark of industrial growth .
even so , the fact remains that even the absolute level of public sector investment in real terms was not maintained during 1966 - 69 .
there was only a nominal recovery during the fourth plan .
this evidence supports the assertion that there was a virtual investment famine in the country during the decade 1965 - 75 .
the fifth plan marked a significant revival of public sector investment .
there were important sectoral differences in the relative increase in investment from plan to plan .
this was as may be expected because investment allocations by sectors was a major instrument of implementing the plan strategy .
the second and the third five - year plans emerge clearly as industry - power - transport plans .
in the third plan , while the growth rate of investment in manufacturing declined considerably , it went up impressively in the case of power .
to quote the seventh plan document : " the first 500 mw thermal generating unit was commissioned and the manufacture of 500 mw turbo generators and boilers has commenced .
there has been systematic upgradation of production technology for other equipment needed by the power sector .
a strong base has been laid for the rapid development of the electronics industry . "
the plan set a target of 8 per cent growth per annum in industrial production .
hydro - electric power , which was cheaper and more enduring , was very inadequately developed .
the consumption pattern was changing , showing the increasing importance of industry as a consumer of power .
industry took as much as two - thirds of the power generated and textiles , cotton and jute were the largest purchasers .
agriculture was yet to emerge as a substantial consumer .
thus power development was inadequate and extremely lopsided .
it would be meaningful to investigate what steps were taken or contemplated by the government of free india to correct these deficiences .
the damage to man by insects is far outweighed by the good they do .
insects appeared on our planet much before there ever was an indication that man would one day stand erect on the ground !
insects were among the first air - breathing land animals .
they soon dominated the earth then and created all the essential prerequisite conditions for the appearance of man .
if in future man does inevitably eliminate all other wild animals , with his ever advancing technology , insects would still dominate the scene .
the extinction of man will not abolish insects , because insects do not depend on man , but it is man who is dependent on insects .
the insect giant is over a thousand times the insect dwarf !
many are iridescent and coloured metallic green , blue or coppery - red .
most have bright spots , bands or marks , with beautiful patterns of contrasting colours .
some beetles , butterflies and moths are objects of great beauty .
an ancient group the insects are an ancient group of animals .
they are known as fossils from the carboniferous epoch of the great palaeozoic era ( 300,000,000 years ago ) .
the oldest known insects belonged to an extinct order called palaeodyctioptera .
many of our common insects have no doubt popular names .
further , popular names naturally differ from place to place and thus add to the confusion .
under such conditions scientific documentation and retrieval of information becomes impossible .
such names do not also indicate real affinities of the different species , so essential for classification and filing of data .
both as aquatic larvae and as aerial adult , these insects are voracious hunt - ers .
the dragonflies rest with the wings spread out , but the damselflies fold them back behind when resting .
often as many as several dozen gnats may be found in this basket .
the larvae feed on all sorts of water animals , often including mosquito larvae , tadpoles , small fish .
earwigs live mostly underground and feed on roots of plants .
the female is wingless and male has two pairs of narrow pigmented wings .
the first tarsal segment is greatly swollen and contains silk glands .
they are an ancient group , fossils of which occur in geological strata as old as 250,000,000 years .
most cockroaches are gregarious and nocturnal and some species are semi - aquatic and still others live in caves or nests of ants .
though most lay eggs , some species are viviparous .
actually , however , they are not praying , but " are preying on insects .
with the toothed forelegs , the mantid waits motionless for the prey to come within approach .
there was only one refinery , that of the assam oil company at digboi , with an output of 180,000 gallons a day .
it could meet only 5 per cent of the country ' s requirements .
within about three decades following 1920 , the total energy supplied by oil and natural gas increased from 15 per cent to 50 per cent .
the progress in india in this direction was not so spectacular , yet it was unmistakable .
the world - wide preference for oil in place of coal was due to certain advantages going with the former .
uniformity of quality , convenience of storage and handling , less loss of wastage and relative ease of temperature control were some of them .
wing beats are brought about by the rapid contractions of muscles in the thorax .
when the insect is on the ground , the contractions of these muscles move the legs when the insect walks or runs or jumps .
the marvel of the whole series of events is the co4ordinated action of different muscles , varying widely in size , position , power , etc .
there are many basic differences between the flight of insects and of birds .
most insects are voracious eaters , yet many of them survive prolonged starvation .
the caterpillars of butterflies and moths are heavy feeders , but the adults either suck the juices of rotting fruits or sip nectar from flowers .
although as a class insects do eat almost anything , it is true that every insect has to work very hard for a living !
the insect has been wise to this trick long before there ever was an indian wedding !
in the nests of termites , ants and wasps the same conditions prevail , of course for a different reason .
they do not have the time to notice an unobtrusive intruder .
she goes underground and starts nursing her first brood of young by feeding them with a special secretion of her own saliva .
the queen thenceforth concentrates on egg laying and continues to lay eggs for about another fifteen years or so .
an ant colony usually contains over half a million individuals .
ants nests are built underground , on trees , inside hollow tree trunks , thorns , old nuts and fruits and among leaves .
when the rains come next , the workers bring out the seeds and sow them around their nests .
after a harvest , the workers neatly pile the unwanted chaff and sticks in a circle around the nest entrance .
the leaf - cutting ants , belonging to the tribe attini , cultivate a cherished fungus as food , on a specially prepared culture medium bed inside their nests .
the pieces of leaves are held aloft over the head like an umbrella , so that the worker may run freely and reach the nest with least delay .
a band of workers now brings the spores of the food - fungus and inoculates the culture bed of cut leaves with the spores of the fungus .
any foreign fungus that may appear as weed is promptly removed and destroyed by the ants .
many of them like the beetles , spiders , and silverfish look very much like ants .
some crickets serve as grooms and clean the body of ants . iii .
how does the newly emerged moth or butterfly know that it should fly to a particular flower for nectar ?
how do wings develop within the pupal skin , filled with unorganized tissues , which are being broken down ?
why do moths and butterflies undergo metamorphosis , but bugs do not ?
they live in a highly lethal environment , in which the chances of survival are not very bright .
the adult insect is usually capable of moving from place to place , finding its food and avoiding dangers .
care of eggs the insect mother does not carelessly scatter her eggs .
grasshoppers often push the eggs down to great depths in the soft soil , with the help of their extraordinarily extensible abdomen .
the female aquatic beetle hydrous builds simple egg rafts of silken threads and bits of leaves of water plants .
she often gathers shreds of roots and other fibres , which she webs together into a capacious basket , to contain her eggs ( figure 69 ) .
other water beetles prepare very complicated egg rafts of silken threads , webbing odd bits of leaves .
the raft is a massive silken boat , closed on all sides and cleverly comouflaged by leaves .
the female builds a complex of several pot - shaped cells of clay .
when the pot has been adequately provisioned , she tears off its circular rim and with the mud thus obtained , closes the mouth of the pot !
work on another pot then begins .
the spider - hunting wasp sceliprhon builds about a dozen elongated cells of mud , placed side by side .
she builds the nest exactly to the size of her own body , since her children are not likely to be larger than herself .
very often the mother herself prepares the necessary food or cultivates and stores up in the nest the special food plant on which the larva will feed .
as soon as they are born , they promptly climb to their mother ' s back and remain there protected under her wings .
the young cockroaches leave the mother only after one or two moultings , when they are able to fend for themselves .
our common mole cricket glryllotalpa prepares an underground nursery chamber , in which she deposits her eggs .
her solicitude continues until all her eggs have hatched .
the young larvae now crowd together and crawl under the mother very much like chickens under a hen .
they disperse in search of food and when fully fed , come back to the mother .
his wife is aware of his mean and evil ways and so out he goes without even a farewell from her .
if she does not lick her eggs , they fail to hatch .
if she is in some way disturbed , she carries her eggs to another place of safety .
the newly hatched young earwigs are gregarious and always cluster around their mother .
she even lies on her back and lets her children run over her and have fun for themselves .
if any larva strays away , she at once seizes it in her mouth and brings it back to the fold .
here is a life totally devoted to her children .
direct feeding of the young by the mother is also known .
the most remarkable instance is that of the sexton beetle necrophorus .
an orthodox biologist will , however , tell us that their activities do not show any mind comparable to that of man .
is the insect then moved only by instinct ?
is there no gleam of intelligence in insect behaviour ?
does not parental care among them acquire an emotional tone at some level ?
he found that the bee went on with the routine of egg - laying and closing the tube , utterly unmindful of the disappearance of the larval food .
the smaller units needed organised assistance by way of finance , raw materials and marketing facilities .
the orientation in government policy from protection to development was slow in coming .
the diesel engine has certainly been a boon to modern industry , agriculture and transport .
it is more economic and efficient than the steam engine , which it fast displaced .
its importance and utility in a country of continental dimensions , and a predominantly agricultural economy like india , can hardly be exaggerated .
the cooper engineering company and kirloskar brothers were the only manufacturing units before the war .
now we throw a number of crickets before a female digger wasp , which we had seen was once hunting for them .
but supposing she had done so , she would not have gained anything .
the paralyzed cricket would soon have recovered from the anaesthesia of the sting administered by the wasp , but there was no place to drag it into !
the wasp must at all costs avoid a frontal attack and jump on the victim from behind .
the interesting thing in this is that the wasp does all the three things , depending on circumstances !
they can recognize new situations and can alter their behaviour accordingly .
it is our common experience that women are governed largely by instincts and are most often right where children are concerned !
although man has done everything to drive them out of their natural homes , insects still successfully hold on to their own .
the slowing down of development during the winter months is called hibernation and the similar retardation during the host summer is called aestivation .
this slowing down is a physiological necessity for a normal grasshopper life .
they are usually coloured yellow or green , differently from the adult .
they feed voraciously , grow rapidly and moult their skin five to seven times .
the wings appear as ever - increasing lobes from the third moulting or sometimes the fourth .
the adult grasshoppers turn brown or red .
most grasshoppers have a single generation in a year , but others have two of unequal duration .
rarely some kinds of grasshoppers pass through several generations in a year .
there are over a thousand species of grasshoppers in india .
the best known and perhaps also the most common and colourful of our grasshoppers is poecilocerus pictus , the painted - grasshopper .
this breeds in abundance on the milkweed plant calotropis and though common all over india , is essentially a denizen of semiarid localities .
the yellow coloured young ones have bright black and red spots and as the moultings take place , the colour gradually turns to blue and bright yellow .
gastrimargus marmoratus is a brilliant orange and black coloured species common among grass in the plains .
hieroglyphus banian and oxya velox are generally found on grass , but damage various crops , particularly paddy .
fulgoridae or leaf - hopper bugs , brightly coloured bugs that secrete copious waxy secretion as in hilda occurring on ficus .
pyrilla sucks sap from sugarcane .
idioceus the mangohopper bug that causes damage to mango blossoms belongs here .
cicadidae or the cicadas , the famous insect musicians , are placed among the homoptera .
they are typically forest insects , but do occur elsewhere also .
the cicada is remarkable for its prolonged infancy .
some males have grotesquely shaped horns , spines and tubercles on various parts of their body .
most beetles are swift runners , others dig underground , but many live in bushes and tree trunks .
they undergo complete metamorphosis , often with different types of larvae .
the order coleoptera is divided into complex suborders , superfamilies and families , which are too numerous to be listed here .
they are large , metallic - green insects with red reflections .
the iridescent elytra of these beetles are used as inlays in gem work .
most click - beetles are about a centimetre long , but some are three times longer .
when one of these beetles falls upside down on its back , it does not struggle helplessly , kicking its legs , like every other beetle .
the most abundant and very conspicuous beetles during the monsoons are the blister - beetles , also calledcantharids .
the buried dung ball serves as the brood - pear ; the egg is deposited on it and the larva feeds on the dung .
it develops for a whole year or even more before pupating .
it is found through - out the plains , particularly wherever cocoanut grows .
the adult beetles fly during the night and eat into the soft growing point of the palm through the folded fronds .
when the cocoanut , frond opens out , it presents rugged holes .
in the case of others , the young ones do all the feeding and the adult does not generally live longer than is necessary to lay eggs .
the wasps and hornets belong to the order hymenoptera .
there are many different kinds of them in our country .
some of them lead a lonely life , but others are social insects .
the colony of social wasps consists of queens , workers and drones .
the former is a larger yellow and reddish species and the latter is mostly honey - yellow and somewhat smaller .
the honeybees are social insects , but all bees are not social ; there are many solitary bees in india .
not all bees gather nectar and produce honey ; but all of them gather and store up pollen grains .
it is the honey of this species that is gathered by forest personnel and sold in our markets .
during the process of digestion , the different kinds of sugars present in the nectar are all changed into glucose .
the bees and their larvae feed on the honey and pollen .
it is a large shiny black species , the male of which is covered by soft yellow pubescence on the thorax .
it is a long - tongued bee that gathers mainly pollen , but not nectar .
it is of considerable importance in effecting cross - pollination of flowers .
it flies actively back and forth from flower to flower the whole day long and even at night when there is full moon .
it visits between thirty and forty flowers every minute .
our wealth of butterflies and moths is truly great and varied .
the majority of them are not only harmless , but are also indispensable members of nature .
they are responsible for bringing about the cross - pollination of most of our flowers .
butterflies and moths are at once distinguished from other insects by their large , colourful wings and the long coiled proboscis .
the colour of their body and wings is due to the arrangement of minute , flat , thin , delicate structures , called scales , in definite patterns .
they are placed in the order lepidoptera , a group of very recent origin , compared with the ancient orders of grasshoppers and cockroaches .
silk is really the solidified saliva of the caterpillar .
on the surface of the pupa we may notice indications of the legs , wings , etc , of the future butterfly .
butterflies are often confused with moths , but with a little care they may be readily distinguished .
most butterflies are diurnal , and most moths are nocturnal .
the antennae of butterflies are usually long and somewhat knobbed at the tip , but most moths have short , plumose or branched , but not knobbed antennae .
in most butterflies the base of the hind wings is expanded to fit tightly under the fore wings during flight .
butterflies there are over 1500 species of butterflies in india .
the largest of our butterflies is also the most beautiful troides helena minos , popularly known as the birdwing butterfly .
this has a wing - span of 190 mm .
the smallest butterfly is zizeeria trochilus , with a wing span of 12 mm .
half male and half female or gynan - dromorph forms are sometimes met with .
a return flight follows next spring .
the butterfly pieris , for example , migrates from the himalaya to the north indian plains during winter and goes , back to the himalaya in summer .
they remain clustered , totally covering the plant , for days together , before becoming scattered some day .
the common butterflies of india are hesperids , danaids , papilionids , pierids , nymphalids , satyrids and lycaenids .
they are generally stout and sombre coloured butterflies , with clavate antennae , which are also curiously hooked at the tip .
the larvae feed mainly on grasses , ginger , turmeric and other related plants .
baoris mathias is the well known rice - skipper , which also breeds on many other grasses .
udaspes folius causes some damage to ginger and turmeric crops by devouring the leaves .
their caterpillars are smooth , generally yellowish - green and with characteristic black bands .
some of them bear short fleshy tubercles or horns .
the lilac coloured caterpillars have four pairs of fleshy processes and breed mostly on the leaves of ficus bengalensis , ficus glomerata , nerium , etc .
though mostly black or brown , their beauty is enhanced by varied colour markings , with bright red and yellow .
their hind wings often have a long tail and hence the name swallow - tail butterflies .
they are common in the forests , grasslands , plains and hills and are mostly abundant during the rains .
the caterpillars are never hairy and do not also have fleshy processes or tubercles .
they generally feed on the leaves of aristolochia , umbelliferae , rutaceae , etc .
papilio demoleus is the common lemon butterfly , with a black body and wings , marked with pale yellow bands and spots .
there is beautiful red eye - spot on the hind wings .
later however , it turns into a beautiful green larva with oblique white bands .
the velvety - brown caterpillar has cream - coloured cross - bancls on the abdomen .
graphium sarpedon is common in gardens and is easily recognized by its bright blue longitudinal band on both wings .
what are the special features of the insects which live exclusively with man in his urban homes ?
it might again be stated that as a class insects are lovers of open air and sunshine and green vegetation .
they have been so long with man that many of them actually share some of our traits .
indeed it is often possible to say what sort of people live in a house by studying the household insects there .
though the list of our domestic insects is long and varied , we shall confine ourselves only to the synanthropous houseflies , cockroaches , crickets and bedbugs .
these are unavoidable byproducts of human civilization and technological advance .
it can only sponge its liquid nutrient from moist surfaces !
if the food is dry , the fly will first moisten it with its saliva and then lick the moist area , sponging the dissolved nutrients .
the original and natural food of the housefly is fermenting vegetable matter and dungs of herbivores .
the eggs are deposited in decaying organic matter and from these eggs . hatch in a day or two pale yellow , legless worms , called maggots .
the maggots feed on the decomposing matter .
they are important scavengers which help in the quick disposal of filth .
they become full - grown in four or five days and turn into cylindrical brown pupae , 5 - 7 cm below the ground .
the adult flies emerge from these pupae in another three or four days time .
like the cockroach , the cricket may also occasionally nibble on the hair and skin of new - born babies .
depending on the air temperature , the cricket chirps for hours on end in its characteristic manner , so well known to us .
like the ubiquitous cockroach , the house cricket has also been widely distributed by man .
at nightfall it sallies forth to puncture the skin of man and drink his blood .
not the least part of detestability of the bedbug is its peculiar and penetrating stink .
production was 11,614 tons in 1941 .
imports amounted to 78,000 tons in 1945 - 46 .
but during 1951 - 53 , they averaged 80,000 tons , showing that the home output was inadequate .
caustic soda is vital in the manufacture of rayon , soap , textiles , paper , rubber , dyestuffs and a host of other products .
there was no production of this important chemical before the war .
the industry could not make much headway during the war because of difficulties of procurement of plant and machinery .
production increased after the war .
the part of the body that is partially submerged in the water is covered by pubescent hairs .
orectocheilum gangeticunvtis the common whirligig beetle of the plains and dineuteb indicus is a large species , found both in plains and on the hills .
the divers the divers in our ponds , lakes and tanks include many diverse insects .
the mayfly larvae ( are truly aquatic insects , which breathe by means of tracheal gills , borne oh either side of each abdominal segment .
its stomach and intestine are filled with air to increase the general buoyancy of the body during the short nuptial flight .
aquatic bugs the aquatic bugs live in water both as larvae and as adults .
the adult bugs have well - developed wings and during rainy season they often fly towards light at night .
they are voracious predators sucking body fluids of many insects or blood of fish , tadpoles and frogs .
they rise to the surface water for renewing their supply of air for breathing , at regular intervals , after diving .
the most common of jour water - bugs are the water - scorpions , corixids , back - shimmers and the giant water - boatman .
they are generally flat and dingy coloured bugs with stout hooked forelegs .
ranatra is somewhat more slender than laccotrephes .
a stream differs from all stagnant waters in that there is a constant flow of the water .
this flow acts unfavourably on animal movements and locomotion .
the common stream insects are dimdamflies , blepharo - cerids , mountain midges , stoneflies , etc .
it is a region of atmospheric aridity , with sparse , thorny vegetation .
in the hot deserts the atmospheric temperatures may rise in the shade to above 50c .
a locust is essentially a grasshopper that is capable of becoming gregarious and migratory , in regular alternating cycles .
locusts are polymorphic grasshoppers that exist in three unstable phases viz . the solitary phase , the gregarious phase and the transient phase , differing in structure and habits .
the transient phase is a group of individuals between the solitary and gregarious phases .
locusts swarm in their gregarious phase .
migration precedes the sexual maturity .
the individuals of the solitary phase show no tendency at all for migration and their eggs develop without diapause .
there is also no colour change of the grasshopper on becoming sexually mature .
there are many species of locusts in the world ; two species of locusts are of particular interest to india .
many species of dung - roller and chafer beetles also live here .
these are the conditions that preclude the life of ordinary insects with which we are familiar in the forest , plains , gardens and fields .
these insects were not even born in india , though they are as truly indian as any of us are .
the distribution of the high altitude insects on the himalaya presents a curious stratification of different species at successively higher elevations .
the forestline on the himalaya is therefore a threshold of the new world that is earthly and at the same time unearthly !
they occur on submerged stones under the cascading cold water .
the adult flies are very delicate midges with long and slender antennae and looking very much like mayflies .
the rove - beetle atheta occurs at 5600 m , which is the world record in altitude for beetles .
when the damage is of such magnitude or nature as to cause appreciable economic loss to the community , the insect is called a ' pest ' .
locusts naturally head the list of injurious insects .
the cotton crop is extensively damaged by the bollworm larvae of the moths earias and platyedra .
the potato is spoilt in the field and godown by the larvae of the potato - moth .
useful insects the useful insects provide man with food , clothing , medicines , wax , lac , dyes and numerous other valuable products .
cooked grasshoppers dipped in chocolate are served in many fashionable restaurants in the united states .
the ramayana mentions the use of silk .
lord vishnu is described as robed in yellow milk and the goddess saraswathi in white silk .
the factory was ready only in 1950 .
there was no production at this time of other nitrogenous fertilisers like ammonium nitrate and urea .
of the phosphatic fertilisers , superphosphates have been manufactured in india for a long time by treating bones with acid .
but this was an uneconomical process , particularly when there was a ready dollar market for bones .
the average annual production before the war was a meagre 2,000 tons against a consumption of 10,000 tons .
to ensure the future growth of the industry , it was of great urgency that steps be taken to augment the supply of sulphur .
different kinds of flies serve as excellent baits in fishing .
beneficial insects the beneficial insects promote the objectives of man in some way or other .
though they are not used by man as food or clothing and medicine , their activities benefit him in a number of ways .
the beneficial insects are , in effect , our collaborators and comrades .
tion of the wind - pollinated flowers , most plants depend on different insects for effecting the cross - pollination of their flowers .
most compositae are butterfly pollinated .
the diptera flowers are generally white or blue and have nectaries exposed and often foul scented .
it is most advantageous to keep bee - hives in orchards to secure an abundant fruit harvest .
acute malnutrition will then eliminate more than half the human race !
a second important class of beneficial insects includes the species which feed on various weeds and help keep them in check .
every weed in our field or orchard is attacked by one or more insects ; this prevents the weeds from overcrowding the land .
the most classical example of weed - destroying insect in india is the prickly - pear cactus mealy - bug dactylopius tontentosus .
a third class of beneficial species are the predators and parasites of insects , which are injurious to man .
it is a great misfortune for insects and a good fortune for man that the most implacable enemies of insects are insects themselves .
not only predatory insects , but also the entomophagous parasitic insects eliminate almost ninety per cent of the population of injurious insects .
they manage to do this unobtrusively and with minimum cost and maximum efficiency by attacking their eggs , larvae , pupae , etc .
&amp; the howrah - sibpur conspiracy case was instituted early in 1910 .
the magisterial inquiry commenced on 4 march .
the magistrate committed them for trial before a special tribunal of the high court on 20 july .
the chief justice did not think that the evidence produced proved naren ' s involvement .
it was in the jail , while under going the trial , that jatin mukherjee , naren and others drew up a plan of their future work .
naren ' s contact with the revolutionaries in india during his travels in search of arms was maintained through the firm .
the news , spread like wild fire , to affect the indian soldiers of the british army also . "
continuing he stated : ' then we were confronted with the problem of getting the promised arms into the country .
we chose the dutch east indies , and before the end of 1914 , i left for javamy first trip out of the country . "
several hundred rifles and other small arms with an adequate quantity of ammunition could be acquired through chinese smugglers who would get them on board the ships .
the plan failed because the germans would not play such a serious game .
it brought him in contact with sun yat - sen and other leaders of the chinese revolution and also made him travel all over china .
engaged in that effort , naren found himself in british custody for one night in the chinese city of tientsin .
the sense of justice of the british consul - general and his own resourcefulness rescued him out of that predicament .
towards the end of 1915 , there was a revolt in two chinese provinces of yunan and szechuan , bordering on burma and india .
the revolt was against yuan shi - kai ' s plan to restore monarchy .
the rebels had plenty of arms .
the acceptance took place later , under the guidance of michael borodin , one of the leaders of russiaii revolution whom he met and befriended in mexico .
the transition from nationalism to socialism was a big event in roy ' s political career .
roy continued to work for the revolution .
one was based on the operation of economic forces , while the other was indifferent to them .
roy did not travel the whole road to socialism in one step .
the transition from socialism to communism which was accomplished the following year in mexico was , however , quick .
roy landed in mexico without any money and without any friends .
that letter enabled him to find an entry into the higher ruling circles of mexico .
contacts with officers of the german military machine established in java enabled him to get hold of large amounts of money .
borodin had sewn the jewels in the bottom of two suitcases .
on the journey he had entrusted the suitcases to an austrian army officer who was to deliver them to his wife in chicago .
through some mishap , the officer could not discharge his responsibility for about a year .
that left borodin stranded in new york which he had to leave soon to escape arrest .
thus , he landed in mexico city without any money and under an assumed name .
the meeting proved crucial for roy ' s political life .
he also arranged for the search of the army officer and the suitcases entrusted to him .
the search was not fruitful , but eventually the suitcases reached borodin ' s wife .
the news of the russian revolution had travelled all over the world and electrified the atmosphere in many countries .
the demand became more insistent when the news of the presence of a bolshevik emissary in the city as the guest of the general secretary leaked out .
a suggestion was made that an extraordinary conference of the party should be held to convert it into a communist party .
the conference decided to change the name of the party .
it became the communist party , the first in the world outside russia .
it adopted the manifesto issued by the comintern and decided to affiliate itself to - it .
it was also decided to send a delegation to the second congress of the comintern which was to meet in moscow in the middle of the following year .
on the whole , it was a rich and gratifying experience .
inasense , mexico was the land of my re - birth .
it is true that before coming here i had begun to feel dissatisfied with ideas and ideals of my earlier life .
the fundamental change in the outlook on life enabled me to overcome the emotional attachment to the land of my rebirth . "
i no longer believed in political freedom without the content of economic liberation and social justice .
to roy , the journey to moscow was like a pilgrimage .
roy had to spend over four months in berlin before arrangements could be made to take him to moscow .
he utilised the time to study the condition in germany and to meet and discuss problems , theoretical and practical , with leaders of the socialist and communist parties .
the imperial regime of the kaiser had been overthrown , before roy reached berlin .
after a few months of civil war , terror and anarchy , the social democratic party had placed itself in power .
a section of the army marched into berlin and occupied the city .
the government ran away in panic .
prominent amongst them were bernstein , kautsky and hilfierdlng .
but contact was established soon and he was able to meet all prominent leaders of the communist party of germany .
the discussions widened roy ' s knowledge and he acquired a firmer grip on communist theory and practice .
it lasted throughout his life .
the three remained together inside the comintern as well as outside it .
roy reached moscow in the latter half of april 1920 .
borodin was there to receive him and arranged for his stay in the same place where he .
the more mature lenin knew that they would grow out of joint working with a national revolutionary movement .
the work that he did regarding the development of communism in india received the full support and endorsement of the comintern .
it was , as a matter of fact , impossible to take a final decision once and for all .
the question depended on the relation of forces and it changed from time to time and was different in different countries .
the two thesis were quoted frequently in the various phases of the chinese revolution .
he was assigned the task of carrying the revolution to the east and more particularly to india .
he was to open " the second front of world revolution " .
by this time roy ' s idea of a revolution in india had undergone a complete change .
he has described his new idea in the memoirs as follows : " according to my new faith , revolutions took place of necessity .
no individual was indispensable .
until that basic condition was created , no armed uprising should be undertaken because it was sure to fail .
social forces antagonistic to the established order must in the first place be politically mobilised and recruited in the army of revolution .
only then would arise the question of arming the soldiers ready to fight for liberation .
pooling home output with imported sugar did not bring the sale price much lower .
high cane price made sugar costly , while any reduction in this price brought about a contraction in sugarcane cultivation .
the industry made good progress in the post - war years taking the country to self - sufficiency in ordinary paper but not in respect of newsprint and strawboards .
sokolnikov and safarov , two russians prominent in the government and the party , were also members of the bureau .
but as they were busy with other things , the main responsibility of the work of the bureau devolved on roy .
later , the plan had to be dropped owing to lack of cooperation from the government of afghanistan .
the arms and the military officers who accompanied them proved useful eventually for subduing the british inspired revolts and for imparting military training to indian muhajirs .
living conditions in tashkent were very difficult .
the tsarist officials and other upper - class prussians had fled from the place after the outbreak of the revolution .
but before fleeing , they had wrought as much destruction as they could .
it was the former residence of the representative of the emir of bokhara .
after the revolution the russian government had granted independence to the emir of bokhara and the khan of khiva .
the main difficulty in the way was the strong religious sentiment of muslim masses .
for the purpose , roy studied the koran and other religious books of islam .
the emir and the khan were eventually subdued through military operations and revolution was spread to bokhara and khiva ,
some of them were captured by turkoman rebels and were grossly ill - treated .
on getting the news in bokhara , roy sent a detachment of the red army for their rescue .
after rescue they were taken to bokhara where roy had talks with them .
most of them were religious fanatics who were keen on going to turkey .
there were a few who were educated .
the prospect of military education held out by roy attracted them and they agreed to go with him to tashkent .
they were about fifty .
in tashkent , roy had to make lodging and boarding arrangements for the muhajirs who went with him .
the place where they stayed came to be known as ' india house ' .
he had also to open for them a military and political school .
the russian officers who went along with the equipment acted as instructors .
the russian government had to take notice of it in order that trade relations established after the trade treaty signed in march 1921 might not get disrupted .
the school remained in existence from october 1920 to may 1921 .
the same fate befell the political school .
the latter is more significant from the point of view of the communist movement which later developed in india .
they joined the communist party , after their release .
another important event which took place in tashkent was the formation of the communist party of india .
it was formed in october 1920 .
roy did not like forming the party outside when there was hardly any communist activity in the country .
a few were added when it shifted to moscow . after the party was formed in india , it became its foreign bureau .
but apart early in 1921 roy had to go back to moscow .
all these decisions were taken with the full approval of roy .
roy utilised his time in moscow for writing his most important book of the period , india in transition .
it is the first ever analysis of the indian situation from the marxist point of view .
it was written in english , but was immediately translated into russian , german and many other languages .
the book provided exciting food for thought to young men who were groping their way from gandhism to socialism and communism .
it had a strong influence on the development of the communist movement in india .
it was only a part of the big literary project that he had visualised .
the following year , however , things started positively looking up .
demand was increasing fast and the mills had to switch over to two - shift working , utilising available idle capacity .
the government actively stepped in to encourage higher production through incentives and concessions .
labour was sought to be placated through a proposal for war bonus .
cost of alterations to and re - conversion of machinery was allowed to be treated as revenue expenditure .
the provisions of the factories act and the industrial disputes act were relaxed to make a fifty - four - hour week and lower over - time rates possible .
but soon japan ' s advance was checked and , egged on by a growing war demand , the industry was once again back into shape .
the internal conditions , however , were now becoming explosive , with politics getting a militant edge and labour getting restive .
roy was the friend , philosopher and guide of the party .
his idea was to build it up as a people ' s party .
the hope ended when in 1940 the congress refused to support the anti - fascist war .
roy expected the rdp to play that role .
the war was the supreme event of the period .
the fate of the . world depended upon it .
japan had joined the war and in a few months had liquidated the mighty british empire in south - east asia .
there were bomb strikes in madras and calcutta and there was panic all over the country .
the government of india had no adequate plans and arrangements for the country ' s defence .
the cripps mission came at this critical time to win over the congress and the muslim league .
the mission failed .
the congress continued its non - co - operation and ultimately began its resistance movement in august 1942 .
roy was deeply pained by this development .
the defence of the country , roy stated , was the duty and responsibility of the people .
he was in calcutta when the panic was spreading .
the trade union movement became keener in response to great political upheavals , and there was widespread unrest and agitation .
the partition of the country left the productive capacity of the industry intact , but it hit the industry badly in two major respects .
but in the midst of a sellers ' market then prevailing - , the challenge implicit in the partition of the country was not realised in its true dimensions .
the boom created by the korean war was short - lived , and the industry entered the year 1952 under the shadow of a slump .
the sellers ' market prevailing for more than a decade and the attendant prosperity were no more .
the slump , which started in 1952 , first affected finer varieties whose production was increasing .
they embodied some of the features of radical humanism which became the driving force of roy ' s activities in the next and the last phase of his life .
in the next and last phase of his life roy moved away from communism and began his journey towards radical humanism .
radical humanism was the new , all - embracing philosophy of life that he evolved after discovering the faults and shortcomings of communism .
but in actual practice , he found , that it had established in russia , where it had triumphed , a regime of tyranny and slavery .
so we often refer to the buildings , gardens and paintings of the mughal period as relics of the mughal culture .
it is the same with religion .
only geographical , cultural and linguistic unity and a common history are the characteristics found in most nations .
but there are countries like switzerland and canada which have more than one national language .
unity of race , religion , and language or a common history , though most important , are not indispensable .
it has only to be brought out and developed by arbitrary methods , but according to its own inner laws .
the most potent factor of cultural unity , the national language seems to have turned into a dividing force .
most of the people who came to india from other countries have been living side by side with the original inhabitants for thousands of years .
in the early stages of the evolution of human society race played a very important part as the basis of social and cultural unity .
to the conflict between the two largest communities in india , the hindus and the muslims , is ascribed the division of india .
as far as pure religion is concerned , there is fundamental harmony in the inner spiritual experience of hindus and muslims .
this atmosphere of religious harmony continued more or less to the end of the last century .
the ascendancy of the finer varieties was well established , but the production pattern was by no means stabilised in terms of various items of output .
many a change in the technical side of production was introduced during these years .
spinning frames were converted to tape drive and high draft systems almost on a universal scale .
ball - and roller - bearing spindles and rings with greater diameters and spindles permitting greater lift on packages were adopted on a large scale .
the use of combers , as also introduction of double carding , increased in the wake of expansion of output of finer yarns .
the number of spindles spinning yarns from staple fibre , which could be counted in thousands in 1939 , multiplied into lakhs .
later , many nomadic and warlike people came to the country and their admixture modified the national temperament considerably .
agricultural life and the general geographical conditions , have also played a great part in shaping the political structure and development of the country .
obviously , in an agricultural country population is not concentrated in a few cities but is scattered over the villages .
but on account of certain other circumstances , this democracy remained confined to the local level .
in course of time much of it was submerged under water by continuous violent storms .
in one dravidian community the matriarchal system prevailed and generally mothers were given a high status throughout dravidian society .
the most common religious cult was that of the mother - goddess .
trade by land and sea was carried on with the countries of east and west asia .
there is evidence of cultural contact between south india and egypt about 2000 bc .
they had brought with them a primitive nomadic culture . but their religious ideas and practices , their art of warfare and their poetry were fairly advanced .
in india they began to live the settled life of peasants and the various tribes established their little rural democracies .
representative bodies of tribal chiefs known as the sabha and the samiti ruled under the general control of the raja or king .
kingship was usually hereditary .
the main function of the king was to command the army in battle .
in this he was assisted by the com - mander - in - chief .
more than half the managing agencies were converted into private limited companies , and there were also examples of their being converted into public limited companies .
as a result , production of super varieties was increasing though the acreage was falling .
the latter fell from 234.9 million acres in 1938 - 39 to 149 million acres in 1946 - 47 .
this was largely due to the ' grow more food ' drive of the war years .
after partition , india was left with 116.7 million acres .
during the next few years , it was rapidly extended to over 162 million acres .
more than this extension , the changes in the pattern of production were important .
at the same time they began to advance southwards .
but both the theories are a subject of controversy and have not so far been generally accepted .
as we have said before , great progress was made during this period in political and economic organisation as well as in material civilisation .
the other was the way of asceticism and meditation which catered to its love of speculation and its urge towards the realisation of truth .
the former way was followed by the aryans in the form of simple sacrifices and prayers .
non - aryans , on the other hand , put great emphasis on the worship of and devotion to gods .
both these practices were now combined into an elaborate system of sacrifice and worship .
the name vishnu was borrowed from that of an aryan sun - god but his conception as the creator and preserver of the universe was purely indian .
the upanishads deal with two basic questions which arise in the human mind as soon as there is in it an awakening of moral and religious consciousness .
what is the abiding reality behind the changing world of appearance which i see or feel every day in or outside myself ?
the body is obviously liable to change and decay and possesses none of the characteristics of the atma mentioned above .
the consciousness in a dream is essentially a series of changing states and cannot therefore be the true self .
as for the unconscious state in a dreamless sleep , it has no doubt the negative qualities attributed to atma but none of the positive qualities .
this is the final stage of the conception of reality which the human mind can reach .
it may be intuitively realised by the mystic but cannot be theoretically conceived by the philosopher .
thus the upanishad uses the word ananda to bring absolute reality nearer to our comprehension .
this is the answer to the first fundamental question posed by the upanishads .
now it is easy to answer the second question .
the ultimate object of human life and the ultimate norm of human conduct is the realisation of the self automatically leading to the realisation to the universal spirit .
here self does not mean the empirical mind entangled in the maze of needs and desires but the red mind or atma .
a beginning was made in the manufacture of textile machinery in 1940 but the progress of the industry was slow .
in 1950 - 51 , there were some eight major units registered but their output amounted to only rs 1.25 crores .
imports averaged about rs 10 crores .
the cost of modernisation was estimated at rs 300 crores .
it was particularly against compulsory utilisation of machinery of indigenous manufacture .
there was certainly some truth in the contention that capital goods of an indifferent quality and high cost had far - reaching effects unlike one - use consumer goods .
however , improvement in quality , etc . itself partly depended on the assurance of a widening market .
most of the textile mill machinery was old , and it had intensively been worked during the war without regard to its maintenance and wear and tear .
this output was based on single - shift operation and the industry ' s potential was much greater .
imports of woollen manufactures were , however , declining owing to the post - war import restrictions .
exports , on the other hand , were steadily increasing , particularly of carpets .
thus there was a great export potential that the industry could exploit .
on the manufacturing side , the major problem was to improve the competitive strength of the industry .
for this , its machinery , though not obsolete , called for modernisation .
pakistan , japan , brazil and others were establishing jute industry with modern equipment .
the indigenous production needed improvement in quality and a considerable extension to other items , for which the country had to depend on imports .
the rearmament boom of the late thirties brought about a sudden revival of the steel manufacturing industry .
but indian industry was still limited and narrow - based .
all the three units were contemplating expansion programmes which , however , under the exigencies of the war , had to be shelved .
on the whole , however , the equipment was considerably extended , often in disregard of maintenance and long life .
but the company ' s efforts to meet all kinds of war needs , with limited production facilities , deserve brief recounting .
earlier in 1939 , the company had successfully made low alloy structural steel for the construction of the howrah bridge .
the steel corporation of bengal ( scob ) , which went into production in 1942 , also agreed to this arrangement .
statutory control on steel prices was imposed in august 1941 .
from 1 april , 1946 , uniform ex - works retention prices were fixed for all supplies .
the steel equalisation fund was set up in 1943 to enable producers and stockholders to sell steel , both indigenous and imported , at an average equalised price .
thus the price ' retained ' by the producers , the ' retention price ' , was different from that charged to consumers .
the retention price was fixed on the recommendations of the tariff board .
the selling price was fixed by the iron and steel controller , having regard to the demands on the equalisation fund for other purposes .
imported steel was much more costlier and , therefore , the average equalised prices were higher than the retention prices .
as a result , we have today a greatly developed and diversified industrial structure .
these include drugs and pharmaceuticals , petrochemicals , electronics and a large variety of machinery and equipment .
simultaneously , some of the existing industries have expanded substantially .
the output of petroleum and refinery products as well as fertiliser was very small on the eve of the first five - year plan .
these industries have expanded considerably since .
there has been similar expansion in the case of other industries such as coal , cement , steel , power and a host of consumer goods .
the industrial infrastructure comprising transport and communications and financial institutions is greatly developed to sustain the expanded and diversified industrial base .
in this chapter , a review of the infrastructure development is undertaken .
the energy - transport - communications complex is extremely crucial for smooth and accelerated industrial growth .
the per capita energy consumption in the country is low and a restrictive energy policy would indeed pose a dilemma for the country .
very little is known about the extent of these resources .
coal has been the main source of energy in the past .
in india , however , in view of the constraints on the supply of oil , coal will continue as the major source of energy in the country .
thus coal will play a central role in our energy policy for many years .
the targets of the first and the second plan were substantially achieved .
the fifth plan set a production target of 135 million tonnes to be achieved by 1978 - 79 .
its share in passenger traffic went up - during the same period from 26 per cent to 82 per cent .
the future development of road transport will depend on two opposing forces .
with sharper focus on road development under the minimum roads programme , the share of road transport may be expected to grow further .
in a condition of limited resources and acute needs , the optimum utilisation of different modes of transport calls for maximum coordination .
enemy bombing made any progress at visakhapatnam difficult and , for a while , most of the equipment had to be moved to bombay .
work was resumed in 1943 , but progress was slow , and the yard was not ready until 1947 .
the first indian - built steamer was launched in 1948 .
by 1950 , the yard had built up a capacity of three ships totalling 8,000 tons .
the only way to save the yard was for the government to take it over .
but complications arose over the amount of compensation to be paid to the scindias .
in the meanwhile , government proceeded to place orders for building ships with the company to enable it to survive .
in 1951 , it also decided to subsidise the ships built during 1947 - 49 .
while the inroads by cheaper substitutes are a relatively recent phenomenon , the old problems of the industry are becoming more acute .
the natural price advantage it enjoys is further strengthened by its devalued currency and other incentives .
the raw jute grown in india , besides being inferior in quality , is subject to wide output fluctuations .
raw jute prices are also erratic , leading to ups and downs in the farmer ' s income .
these fluctuations in output and prices have become endemic to the jute economy and feed on each other .
they are further accentuated by the fact that land can be easily shifted from jute to rice and back .
india had some 150 factories with an annual rated capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in 1951 .
this capacity was considered adequate till 1956 .
so , retracing the restrictive policy , the government decided to license additional capacity liberally to reach a total capacity of 2 million tonnes .
licences were issued for forty - three new factories and for substantial expansion to forty - two existing units .
care was taken to use the expansion of the industry for achieving a better regional spread .
another 1.5 lakh tonne capacity was shared about equally between tamil nadu and andhra .
towards the end of the second plan , a further additional capacity of 8.8 lakh tonnes was licensed .
sugar beet cultivation may prove profitable in the north .
it is a short crop with a higher sugar content .
it yields 3.4 tonnes of sugar per acre as against only 1.75 tonnes from sugarcane .
the capital expenditure involved in the switchover and the adjustment in machinery to the new process should not be an obstacle .
up to 1958 , indian sugar was cheap in the world market .
cost reduction can be achieved by more efficient operations and proper use of by - products .
operational efficiency is low because of obsolete machinery , uneconomic scale of production and wrong location of some of the units .
even if this had materialised , the domestic supply would have been short of demand in 1960 - 61 .
eventually it was decided to expand the capacity of nepa to 60,000 tonnes .
as a consequence , the production targets could not be realised .
in the meantime it was decided to further expand its capacity to 75,000 tonnes .
it was also proposed in the fourth five - year plan to set up in the public sector a further capacity of 60,000 tonnes .
the demand was increasing all this while , necessitating increasing imports .
the cement industry had a chequered career during era of planning .
the first plan set a target of 5.3 million tonnes of capacity and 4.8 million tonnes of production .
the second plan set an ambitious capacity target of 16 million tonnes , which was more than three times the first plan target .
this meant a shortfall of as much as 6.7 million tonnes or over 40 per cent of the target .
the production target was 13 million tonnes but the realised output was less than 8 million tonnes .
even so , these were significant achievements , as capacity and production increased by 13.1 per cent and 11.6 per cent annually .
the sixth five - year plan ( 1980 - 85 ) fixed a production target of 34 million tonnes .
this called for an additional capacity of about 18 million tonnes , raising the total capacity to 43 million tonnes in 1980 - 85 .
this looked a stupendous task .
the official policy remained short - sighted , restrictive and ad hoc .
indian cement , which was once cheaper than imported cement , became non - competitive .
it is estimated that the annual average loss of production during the decade 1970 - 79 was 3.5 million tonnes .
during the next six years ( 1980 - 85 ) , it exceeded 9 million tonnes per yearalmost one - third of yearly output .
the single most serious constraint was power .
thus the setting for the sixth plan contrasted sharply with the ambitious targets of the plan .
the policy of dual pricing and partial decontrol made a spectacular change in the fortunes of the industry .
as a result , the industry expanded not only in terms of capacity and production but also in terms of its regional dispersal .
a number of units came up in maharashtra , gujarat , rajasthan and madhya pradesh , giving the industry greater regional balance .
however , the official response was neither prompt nor adequate .
the government was reluctant to revise the retention price lest it increased the cost of public sector projects .
soon the corporation was also given the responsibility of setting up of cement plants in deficit and remote areas .
accordingly , during the course of the next decade cci set up cement plants in
in 1981 it had a capacity of about 1 million tonnes which was about 4 per cent of total capacity in the country .
its ten - year perspective plan ( 1979 - 89 ) set out ambitious targets of expansion of its activities .
in 1950 they accounted for almost the entire capacity ( 97 per cent ) .
in 1985 their share was 34 per cent , which was still substantial .
for energy conservation and cost reduction , the process of conversion must be speeded up .
secondly , the size structure of the industry must undergo a change in favour of larger capacity units .
the early units were 60 - 100 tpd units on the wet process .
later , 300 - 600 tpd units emerged .
and the introduction of pre - calcinators helped raise capacity to 3,200 tpd or 1 million tonnes per annum .
here too the change over the years is significant , but there is still considerable scope for improvement .
at the other end of the spectrum are the so - called mini plants with less than 200 tpd capacity .
however , the availability of cement has now dramatically improved , while the concessions have been withdrawn .
restructuring of the industry to enable it to face competition is an urgent need .
preventive maintenance can save the industry significant loss of output .
at the same time it is essential to ensure quality control to build consumer confidence and devise marketing strategies to penetrate new markets .
the development of these industries was the result of a well - orchestrated strategy adopted to achieve a fair measure of self - reliance at the earliest . steel
the steel industry is certainly the most basic industry and considered the starting point of the process of industrialisation on a self - sustained basis .
however , the beginning was modest and growth slow .
consumption of steel was almost static during the first half of the century .
so there was already a deficiency of over 1 million tonnes .
moreover , the planners expected rapid increase in steel demand under the impetus to industrialisation expected to be provided by the five - year plans .
thus steel shortage was expected for most part of the fifties .
but there was little awareness of such a need .
water provides perhaps the cheapest means of transport for certain categories of goods .
the track costs involved in the prevention of siltation , etc . are relatively low .
systematic efforts at exploiting these advantages offered by waterways , however , were not made till the ushering in of the era of economic planning .
port and harbour facilities constitute a vital dimension of shipping and water transport .
inadequacy of port and clearance facilities was another serious bottleneck from which the shipping industry suffered .
all the expansion programmes were implemented in the early years of the second plan .
the hindustan steel ltd . , a government company , was promoted in 1953 to take charge of the steel plant at rourkela .
however , they were still behind schedule and , though they commenced steel production in 1959 - 60 , their operations had not stabilised till 1962 .
as a consequence , there was a substantial shortfall in the plan target of production .
but against that must be set the savings to the nation .
then there was a sudden spurt and imports exceeded 1.7 million tonnes in 1956 .
the total imports amounted to 6.6 million tonnes during 1956 - 60 , or more than a million a year .
they cost the country rs 519 crores in valuable foreign exchangethe cost of three 1 - million tonne plants .
rourkela also worked at 60 to 65 per cent .
but it was durgapur ' s poor record that greatly lowered the overall efficiency level for hsl plants .
the durgapur unit worked at half its capacity for most of the years and at 40 per cent in the worst years .
it was no better for iisco , which was once considered a model for the other plants .
its output fell steeply from 7.23 lakh tonnes in 1965 - 66 to 5 lakh tonnes in 1971 - 72 .
the government had , therefore , to step in and take over its management to stop further rot and eventually revive its health .
however , there was no immediate recovery .
capacity utilisation slumped from 80 per cent in 1968 - 69 to 45 per cent in 1973 - 74 .
in contrast , tisco had a fairly satisfactory record , though in later years it had its modest share of problems .
its production of saleable steel declined from 14.65 lakh tonnes in 1968 - 69 to 12 lakh tonnes in 1973 - 74 .
the capacity utilisation fell correspondingly , from the high level of capacity 98 per cent ( in terms of finished steel ) to 80 per cent .
the total investment in the steel development programme during the fourth plan was rs 1,903 erores as shown in table 11.2 :
in 1973 - 74 bhilai , rourkela and tisco showed a surplus while the rest were in the red .
these plants employed over 2 lakh persons , hsl alone accounting for over 1.15 lakhs .
it was observed earlier that no fresh steel capacity was added during the fourth plan period .
the original construction schedule laid down in 1966 envisaged the completion of the first stage of bokaro ( 1.7 million tonnes ) by the end of 1970 .
there was an initial delay of nine months in starting civil works on account of the drought conditions in bihar .
this provided an opportunity to our equipment manufacturers to develop expertise for the fabrication of many sophisticated items .
in the second stage of expansion its indigenous content was projected to be near 100 per cent .
this meant a significant step - up in capacity and production during the plan period .
it was also proposed to consider the expansion of tisco for which the techno - economic study was commissioned .
technological improvements would also be made for improved productivity and production at the existing plants .
all this was made possible by greater availability of inputs , better industrial relations and improved discipline .
the year 1976 - 77 turned out to be even better .
capacity utilisation exceeded 90 per cent during the year .
there was further step up in production in 1977 - 78 , though not as markedly as in the previous year .
it exceeded 7.6 million tonnes though mainly on account of a higher share of 9 lakh tonnes contributed by the mini steel plants .
demand was sluggish but the drastic fall in output created conditions of scarcity .
the stocks in 1977 - 78 were around 1.25 million tonnes .
thus , whether it be steel or " cement , the economy was suffering from a low - level disequilibrium .
in view of the long gestation involved in setting up steel plants , efforts were continuously made for selection of possible sites for new units .
this was later updated by cedb of hsl .
on the basis of the revised study , the government decided in 1970 to set up three new steel plants at salem , visakhapatnam and vijayanagar .
lack of proper market intelligence on the part of the producers resulted in the mismatch of production and demand .
as a result ; the production of steel in the public sector declined and was below the target .
sizable imports were therefore resorted to .
table 11.3 summarises ' the overall performance of the steel sector in the sixth plan :
the company made a nominal net profit of rupees one crore in 1980 - 81 .
the next year , it improved the profits to rs 39 crores .
the cost and time over - runs of the projects under implementation were serious .
this was generally looked after by the foreign suppliers of plant and machinery .
the activities of cedb were diversified to encompass not only the steel industry but also other fields .
it was thought , therefore , that the organisation should be converted into a full - fledged independent company .
the answer to the shortage of scrap could be the availability of sponge iron .
this process has the advantage of using low - grade non - coking coal .
the plan also indicated the possibility of setting up sponge iron plants based on gaseous reduction considering the availability of natural gas .
the seventh plan envisaged that the first plant based on indigenous technology would go into production in the early part of the plan period .
the future development of the mini steel industry will depend on the availability of sponge iron .
there was a decline once again from this peak level to 52,000 in 1976 - 77 and to 49,000 tonnes in the following year .
however , in view of the unstable nature of production , the proposal for expansion was kept in abeyance .
the stage ii expansion , raising the capacity to 2,60,000 tonnes , was approved in july 1981 with an estimated cost of rs 66 crores .
the project was scheduled to be completed in december 1984 . substantial slippages in the implementation of the project delayed its commissioning .
the project cost too escalated to rs 106 crores .
among the heavy and basic machinery sectors , the most important are mining machinery , metallurgical equipment , heavy electrical equipment and construction machinery .
among the mining machinery group , the most important are the earth moving equipment and drilling equipment required mainly by the coal industry .
however , it will be necessary to create capacities for jumbo drills , suspension gears , continuous miners , load haul dumpers , etc .
the main problems of the industries are need for adequate orders giving enough lead time , technological upgradation and development of new products .
in the oil sector , a variety of equipment , fabricated structurals and other items are required .
the country at present depends on import for most of the sophisticated equipment .
a systematic programme with proper policy support will be required to encourage and develop indigenous capability .
this industry supplies the machinery required for the development of such basic metals as steel and aluminium which constitute the sinews of industrialisation .
in a sense , hec is the symbol of the present state of the industry .
the technology for metallurgical equipment has , however , remained ten to fifteen years behind the times .
this will call for considerable cooperation from the equipment manufacturers , which in turn , would require sizeable technological import .
capacity utilisation has been just about 50 per cent .
this has necessitated diversification of production by bhel and other power equipment manufacturers .
textile machinery industry is one of the oldest engineering industries in the country .
over the years the industry has expanded not only in capacity and output but also in range , quality and sophistication .
apart from its own capacity to meet most of the requirements of textile machinery , it has built a sound ancillary base supplying parts and components .
there is adequate capacity in the country for supply of sugar machinery .
the world has witnessed the electronics revolution .
electronics are permeating every field of human activity and hold the key to modernisation .
they have tremendous potential for improving the standard of living and quality of life of the people .
there is great scope for expansion to meet both domestic and export demand .
the industry continued to expand in the seventies .
electronics production doubled between 1969 - 70 and 1972 - 73 and again between 1972 - 73 and 1976 .
thus , the output of electronics consistently exceeded the targets set by the bhabha committee .
the actual production in 1977 was rs 509 crores as against the target of rs 454 crores .
this was a five - fold increase over the level of 1969 - 70 and meant an annual average growth rate of 45 per cent .
it marked a considerable step - up over the growth rate of 24 per cent or so in the latter half of the sixties .
the growth somewhat slowed down in 1978 and 1979 .
a high - level committee on the electronics industries was , therefore , set up .
with the industrial revolution , the by - products of coke ovens became available .
trombay , gorakhpur , namrup , baraunialmost all the factories since the sixties are based on industrial or refinery gas , fuel oil and naphtha .
they include plastics , synthetic fibres , synthetic rubber , drugs , dyestuffs , paints and varnishes , detergents and pesticides .
but the prospects for exports were rather uncertain , particularly when the home demand was increasing and foreign competition was growing .
the industry continued to face the same old problems , some of which were accentuated by the war and the partition .
the number of larger mines also was simultaneously increasing , and the new mines were opting for mechanisation .
the number of coal - cutting machines increased from 306 in 1947 to 457 in december 1954 .
the import of coal - mining machinery averaged rs 38 lakhs during the three years , 1951 - 52 to 1953 - 54 .
more than one - fifth ( 21.6 per cent ) of the output in 1954 was cut by machines .
the estimates of coking coal reserves were speculative , but there was no doubt that the reserves were inadequate .
the alkali and chemicals corporation in their factory at rishikesh and the union carbide at bombay started producing some of the chemicals as an integral part of polythylene production .
the petro - chemicals committee was appointed in 1960 to report on the prospects of establishing petro - chemical units in the country .
the first naphtha cracker in the country was installed at union carbide india ltd .
it was commissioned in 1966 and started production of the basic raw materials like ethylene for the manufacture of polythylene in place of traditional ethyl alcohol .
the second and much bigger petro - chemical complex was set up near thane ( bombay ) by national organic chemicals industries ltd .
it started its operations in 1967 but was completed in all respects ' in early 1969 .
it marked a significant step forward in the manufacture of thermo - plastics , synthetic fibres and organic intermediate pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs and paints .
the aromatic project has been built with the assistance of the erstwhile west german firm , field fried krupp .
it produces a range of chemicals which had to be imported in the past for the manufacture of a variety of basic chemicals , pesticides and fibres .
these productsthermo - plastics and synthetic fibresare substitutes for cotton and wool which have to be imported in large quantities .
these were largely achieved .
the aromatic recovery project of bharat petroleum corporation and polyester staple fibre project at bongaigaon spilled over to the seventh plan .
in the private sector , capacities were added for dmt , pfy and other synthetic fibres .
the supply of alcohol is linked with the availability of molasses which is a by - product of the sugar industry .
fortunately the recent sugar seasons have been good and there has been , in fact , a surplus of molasses .
it is essential to create proper storage facilities and ensure a steady supply of molasses to the alcohol industry .
the heavy organic chemicals industry in the country is now well established with adequate capacity and production .
in dyestuffs , the country is not only self - sufficient but has been exporting on a significant scale to many countries of the world .
inorganic chemical industries , viz . caustic soda , soda ash , calcium carbide , carbon black , etc . are well established and have adequate capacity .
with the improvement in irrigation facilities , which made intensive cropping possible , the pace of fertiliser consumption was accelerated .
thus , the consumption of nitrogen increased only four - fold during the fifties , but in the sixties , it increased seven - fold .
the use of fertiliser was also discouraged by immediate causes such as adverse weather conditions and lack of adequate power , irrigation and credit .
however , after 1975 - 76 , consumption once again picked up .
this was mainly the result of a series of price reductions announced by the government .
it is true that consumption of fertilisers is determined by a number of factors like price , availability of associated inputs and , of course , the weather conditions .
on the face of it , it would appear that the growth of the fertiliser industry has been impressive .
correspondingly , production increased from around 10,000 tonnes to more than 67 lakh tonnes .
however , in point of fact , preparatory work was started only on the six gas - based plants .
the proposal of a coal - based plant was put off pending the outcome of the coal - based plants under implementation .
moreover , surplus naphtha was not available .
the rest were in the private / joint sector .
of the private sector plants , birla ' s indo - gulf fertilisers &amp; chemicals corporation ' s plant at jagdishpur was commissioned ahead of schedule .
the intervention of the war , instead of spurring the government to making an expeditious decision , provided an alibi to cold storage the proposal .
it was only after the country attained freedom that the scheme was reviewed and the result was the chittaranjan works .
equipped with the latest machines , tools and appliances , the factory had a capacity of 120 locomotives and fifty spare boilers per year .
another unit , which started production of locomotives during these years , was the tata engineering and locomotive company ( telco ) with its factory at tatanagar .
it was estimated to cost rs 7 crores and had a capacity of fifty locomotives and fifty boilers .
the indian - built locomotives were specially designed , keeping in view the local conditions and requirements .
already the number of different types of locomotives in use had declined from 500 in 1925 to 377 in 1952 .
this works out to a compound growth rate of 5.5 per cent per annum .
during the period 1969 - 73 , which is practically the period of the fourth plan , the rate improved to 4.5 per cent per annum .
the three annual plans witnessed a general deceleration in the rates of growth of all the sectors .
during the next five years there was a general recovery , but once again it was not uniform in all the sectors .
however , its base was narrow at the beginning and the weightage attached to it was less than 0.5 per cent .
on the other hand , electricity had both a higher weight of 5.37 and a significant growth rate of around 10 per cent .
power generation nearly quadrupled over the period of the study .
heavy inorganic chemicals and cement are also important in this group , though their weights were small .
the iron and steel industries recorded an impressive growth of a little over 13 per cent in the first half of the sixties .
but the industry remained generally depressed with the result that the index for this group shows only a marginal increase in the next seven or eight years .
heavy inorganic chemicals registered about four - fold growth over the period 1961 - 73 .
their growth was particularly rapid in the first half of the sixties ( 16.4 per cent per annum ) .
among the major industries included in this group are railroad equipment with a weight of 3.50 and motor vehicles with a weight of 2.51 .
the railroad equipment industry showed impressive growth during the third plan period when it grew at the rate of 21 per cent per year .
industrial machinery , which , like iron and a steel , may be regarded as a prime mover of industrialisation , showed a chequered performance .
it grew at the rate of 9 per cent during the first five years .
the electricity generation industry may be rightly regarded as the forerunner of the industrial revolution .
no wonder the growth of electricity is taken as an important index of economic progress .
coal was cheap and readily available .
power development in the country till about the twenties was so insignificant that the subsequent progress looks impressive .
but in absolute terms , the overall growth remained modest till the beginning of the fifties .
for instance , the power - generating capacity in 1900 is said not to have exceeded 1,130 kw .
with a total weight of 25.88 for this sector , this contributed to pulling down the overall growth rate of industry .
it is also evident that the major industries in this group were either stagnant or registered only a very small rate of growth .
cotton spinning with a weight of 11.79 had a poor record of growth .
thus the index for this industry was only 30.5 per cent higher at the end of the period .
the growth record of another major industry in this group , viz . jute manufactures , was even worse .
this was yet another industry which emerged worse at the end of the period than at the beginning .
tyres and tubes registered a high growth rate exceeding 9 per cent .
their growth rate was high and steady and was a little faster in the sixties .
this sector is vital both because it enjoys a weightage of 37.25 per cent and supplies some of the essential wage goods for the masses .
flour milling and grinding expanded relatively faster and like sugar , experienced a high growth rate of 9.8 per cent a year in 1969 - 73 .
on the other hand , a number of new industries registered significant rates of growth , though individually they did not enjoy a substantial weightage .
on the other hand , the new growth - oriented industries expanded much faster than the industrial sector as a whole .
it was not possible to establish exact correspondence between the two sets of industries relevant for the two weighting patterns .
however , the change from one to the other is quite evident .
electricity also gained significantly whose weight went up from 5.37 to 9.23 .
the new index of industrial production with base 1970 now replaced the old series with 1960 base .
this was also lower than the growth rate of 3.8 per cent for the period 1961 - 73 .
the decline in the rate of growth of non - durable consumer goods industries was even more disturbing .
cotton textiles , vanaspati , sugar , tea , and paper remained depressed .
the durable goods industries slightly improved upon their growth rate of the fourth plan , though it was considerably lower than the growth rate recorded during the seventies .
iron and steel , electricity , mining and quarrying , arid most kinds of machinery had substantial recovery .
the reason for the relatively low overall growth rate of industrial production during the seventies is the slow growth of some of the more substantial industries .
similarly , coal with a weight of little over 6 per cent had a growth rate of only 3.7 per cent per year .
another important industry , cotton spinning , continued to be depressed with a growth rate of only 2.1 per cent per year .
jute textiles also grew at the nominal rate of 1 per cent .
the paper and paper products industry also had a poor growth rate .
one such industry , cement , cannot be considered to have grown at a satisfactory rate .
then there was a sudden spurt in 1976 when industrial production increased by 10.1 per cent .
however in 1979 the growth rate slumped to 1.3 per cent .
this set - back may be attributed to severe power and transport shortage and under - utilisation of installed capacity , combined with industrial unrest on a large scale .
in 1975 they grew by 1.5 per cent .
the growth rate improved to 5.8 per cent in the following year but declined to 2.3 per cent in 1977 .
there was a sudden spurt in 1978 when these industries expanded by 8.4 per cent .
however , the total investment as well as public investment slackened from the mid sixties .
we have already seen that it was the capital goods and the basic goods industries which set the pace of industrial expansion during the early sixties .
during the three annual plans as well as the fourth plan this situation changed significantly .
these two sectors were no longer the leading sectors of the economy .
as a result , the industrial growth slowed down considerably .
the step up in total real investment declined substantially in the third plan and further in the three annual plans .
in the following two plan periods the percentage step up in total investment remained more or less at the same level as in the three annual plans .
the decline in the growth rate of real investment in the public sector was even steeper .
this may be partly explained by the big spurt in the second plan over a base level which was very modest .
it would appear that these sectors suffered during the next decade more than the other sectors of the economy .
particularly during the fourth plan , public sector investment in all these sectors declined even in absolute terms .
but the thrust was once again sought to be restored by the fifth plan with substantial step up in real investment in these sectors .
the strategy of development adopted in the second five - year plan was not , however , only industry - power - transport oriented .
within industry it was oriented in favour of basic and capital goods .
the details of investment from plan to plan in individual industries or groups of industries are not available .
however , it is clear that the accent in the second plan was on metallurgical industries , mainly steel .
another basic industry which received a great impetus in the second and third plans was heavy and light engineering .
petroleum refining and fertilisers came up in a big way in the public sector only after the third plan .
official thinking was veering round to the position that various controls like industrial licencing quotas , etc . had outlived their rationale .
the objective conditions had undergone significant change , warranting new initiatives .
the economy had gained in maturity , resilience and sophistication .
considerable growth was achieved since 1950 , but not much thought could be spared for quality , cost competitiveness or needs of modernisation .
thus a high - cost , low - quality production structure had emerged .
the market base had remained narrow , limiting the scope for exploitation of economies of scale , improvement in quality and extension of range of production .
( the index leaves out by and large production in the small - scale sector but includes mining and quarrying and electricity . )
the target was subsequently revised downward to 7 per cent .
the infrastructure industries like coal , steel , cement , petroleum and power continued to grow at about the same pace as in the fifth plan .
this can be seen from table 14.2 .
the remarkable properties of this exoskeleton ( external skeleton ) may be traced to the complex chemical compound called chitin .
another marvel of the insect anatomy is its respiration .
the air is carried directly to the interior of every cell that needs it by a system of delicate branching tubes called tracheae .
this fact accounts for the astonishing powers of endurance and muscular strength of insects .
how numerous are insects ?
over a million and a half species of insects have already been named and described by scientists .
how are insects named and classified ?
in dealing with such an unimaginable wealth of species , some system of classification is absolutely essential .
many hornets and solitary wasps locate a prey , which may be a spider or a cricket lying safely concealed in its underground den .
its forelegs are long and powerful and are armed with stout and sharply pointed spines and teeth .
when folded , the fore legs form a most formidable vice , escape from which is impossible .
the great urgency and importance of exploring new reserves of oil and of their exploration were thus evident .
therefore , the steps taken for setting up an organisation equipped with technical personnel and tools for exploration were slow and tardy .
the only exception was the vigorous prospecting done by the assam oil company , whose efforts succeeded in locating deposits in the naherkatiya area of assam .
the next year , a team of russian experts was invited to advise the government on the organisation which it had set up earlier for oil exploration .
another dimension of the programme of oil production was the proposal to manufacture synthetic oil from coal .
depending on the air temperature , the cricket goes on chirping for hours and hours .
the music of the cicada is perhaps the highest development of sound production in insects .
at the base of the abdomen of the cicada , there is an elastic membrane , tympanum , to the inside of which are attached some delicate muscles .
the sound thus produced is greatly amplified by a resonating column of air space , which may often fill up the whole of the abdomen .
courtship and reproduction the sexual life of insects is as full of marvels as the other aspects of their behaviour .
in some insects , however , there are more females than males and in certain rare cases there are no males at all .
some stoneflies are half - male - half - female ( ardha - nari ) or hermaphrodites .
usually however the two sexes differ in size , colour and other body features , so that the sex dimorphism is very pronounced .
the female insect is usually larger , with better developed sense organs and also lives longer than the male .
others crawl in pairs into a suitable shelter , such as under a stone .
still others mate among leaves , bushes , grass , etc , or even on the open ground .
at the end of mating , the males usually get exhausted and die within a few hours .
it can also face its enemies and can generally take good care of itself .
the eggs and the larvae are , on the other hand , mostly helpless .
the young larvae have also to find shelter and food soon after hatching .
considering the colossal hazards , it is indeed a marvel that insects successfully reproduce and survive at all .
most insects are , however , orphans at birth .
their father having died soon after his marriage and the widowed mother following him after depositing the eggs .
every conceivable material is pressed into service in making the ootheca .
the mantid ootheca is essentially an air - filled solidified foam of a special secretion from the body of the mother .
this ootheca serves eminently as a perfect therma - insu - lator for the eggs .
the ootheca is usually prepared at night and is fixed prominently to some branch in a bush .
three or four pieces are first joined together into an outer envelope , directly lining the interior of the nest cavity .
to this is added two to five successive layers of leaf pieces , with the margins neatly overlapping and expertly tucked in to prevent unrolling .
the common mason wasp eumenes is perhaps the most familiar of our brood nesters .
what is most remarkable is that the gum is all only on the outside and is never carried inside the pot !
by the time the newly emerged young wasp break through out of her pot , the gum is already dry .
how are constant patterns achieved ?
how does the female solve so many architectural problems , without previous experience or training ?
she works strictly according to a definite pattern , of which she has a clear figure . 74 .
she pushes her body fully extended into the cell or pot , in order to estimate the height of the construction .
the miltogramma mother actually presses into her service her deadliest enemy to provide for the welfare of her children !
you cannot beat that for sheer audacity .
their family life stretches even beyond the emergence of the adult offspring .
the female buries the dead bodies ( hence the name &gt; of rats , birds or other small animals , lying on the ground .
on finding a cadaver , the beetle starts digging the grave , first scraping off a little mud from below it .
after the eggs are laid , she plugs the hole of the burial chamber .
when the young larvae hatch , the mother climbs over the decomposing cadaver and starts feeding on the flesh .
now the young larvae leave the egg chambers , reach the main burial chamber and crowd round the mother .
a glistening drop of brown liquid of predigested meat extract is regurgitated by the mother into the eager mouth of the larva .
the mother swallows more and more meat , merely to feed her ever - hungry growing children .
she even makes a faint scraping noise with her legs as a signal to the children that feeding time is on .
he performs his duties alone unwillingly and is a ' grumbling ' father .
the poor fellow rarely , if ever , rebels against his wife .
the giant water - boatman bug belostoma , fairly common in all tanks and even paddy fields , provides the most interesting example of a grumbling father .
the female bug forcibly snatches hold of the male and converts him into an animated incubator - cum - perambulator for her eggs .
above is our common mole - cricket gryllotalpa , brooding over her cluster of eggs in her underground brood nest .
below is a dung - roller beetle with her ' brood - pear ' of dung - ball , inside which she has deposited her egg .
she remains in the nest till the young larva hatches .
the father rolls the dung - ball and the mother is following him . 2 - 3 .
on reaching the nest side , he starts digging with his head and she keeps guard over the dung - ball . 4 .
as the digging progresses , she moves the ball to the pit . 5 .
he is digging vigorously and she deftly manoeuvres the dung - ball to slip into the deepening tunnel . 6 .
although the mother is capable of doing everything herself , the male is anxious to contribute his mite .
she digs the nursery chamber and he guards it .
they live and labour in monogamous bliss till death separates them .
think of the numerous ways in which they make provision for the food of their future offspring .
even the father , generally irresponsible , occasionally looks after the nursery .
herein lies perhaps the clue to eternal enigma ; it is true of the human being too .
no wonder our ancient litera - ture respects woman as a mother and deifies motherhood .
maternal solicitude among insects is associated with habits , social life and intelligence .
was he right ?
some years ago we found a mud wasp eumenes building her nest in a room .
we removed the paralyzed caterpillars from her brood nest as fast as she brought them in .
she took no notice at first and continued to bring in more caterpillars and push them into the empty cell .
by nightfall we had robbed her of five caterpillars , a number more than sufficient for at least two nests .
next morning she brought more caterpillars , but again we removed them .
now she began to show signs of worry .
she made calls to her cells at frequent intervals , without bringing caterpillars , and merely for inspection .
if instinct alone was the guide , the wasp would have brought only one or two caterpillars , which are normally sufficient to fill her cell .
having done that , her instinct should have been satisfied and she should have then closed the cell , even though it remained empty .
she was , however , persistent in bringing more and more caterpillars .
how would we react if a cosmic influence , out of fun of testing our mental ability , subjected us to one such experiment ?
we found , however , that fault lay with the experiment and not the bee .
to our surprise , we found that one morning the wasp had broken down all the three barriers and had made its escape .
the bee or the wasp is normally accustomed to mud partitions and paper is something wholly outside their experience .
how can we find fault with them if they fail to recognize it ?
we must not forget that no animal , including man , is likely to show more intelligence than the conditions of its life ordinarily demand .
want of appreciation of this important fact often leads to much misapprehension ; our experimental psychology is not entirely free from this drawback .
the reason for this peculiar behaviour is not difficult to seek .
the best known and perhaps also the most common and colourful of our grasshoppers is poecilocerus pictus , the painted - grasshopper .
this breeds in abundance on the milkweed plant calotropis and though common all over india , is essentially a denizen of semiarid localities .
the yellow coloured young ones have bright black and red spots and as the moultings take place , the colour gradually turns to blue and bright yellow .
gastrimargus marmoratus is a brilliant orange and black coloured species common among grass in the plains .
the hungry bug first selects a suitable spot , with the help of the highly sensitive tip of the rostrum .
a few are indeed objects of great beauty .
nepa holds the prey by the forelegs and sucks its blood .
we have already mentioned the habit of the male carrying the eggs .
some are degenerated into permanent , sessile parasites on various plants and have lost all traces of wings and powers of locomotion .
they suck large quantities of sap and then concentrate it in their body by exuding the excess of water .
the plant may suffer heavy loss of sap and may even wither away .
they occur gregariously on beans , grass , mustard , radish , cotton , rose and other plants .
they are always attended by a large number of ants , which regularly milk them for the sweet honeydew they secrete .
aphids normally reproduce as virgins , because there are no males among them for several generations .
the mother aphid does not lay eggs , but is viviparous and gives birth to young aphids .
in captivity , it has been observed to gobble up one to two hundred grasshoppers daily .
both the fumes and the liquid are highly caustic and raise blisters on human skin .
selina has a curious ant - like appearance .
if disturbed , they dive promptly under the surface , carrying a glistening bubble of air .
paussid beetles live in nests of ants and give them an aromatic secretion , which they love to feed on .
ceratoderus , platyrrhopalus , etc are common in our country .
one of our prettiest beetles is the ladybird beetle of the family coccinellidae .
their larvae are bright yellow and curiously spiny and occur on leaves .
the beautiful seven - spotted ladybird coccinella septempunctata is widely distributed throughout india .
the firefly is the much smaller and winged male .
this patch is the luminous organ , which emits light at the will of the insect .
the light produced by the glow - worm is pale , greenish - white and cold .
it feeds on soft snails , consuming about half a dozen daily .
while thus feeding , it shuts off its light .
in the large and woody trees in our forests there are the lovely jewel - beetles of the family of buprestidae .
most weevils are generally small in size , but the cocoanut - weevil rhynchophorus ferrugineus is quite large .
the female lays her eggs at the base of the leaf - sheath of cocoanut trees , particularly in cuts made by toddy - tappers .
the larva , hatching from the egg , tunnels into the soft tissues and makes a cocoon of the cocoanut fibres before pupating .
the damage is often very severe .
the largest and the most remarkabld of our weevils is cyrtotrachelus longimanus .
in the male of this species the fore legs are very long and even longer than the rest of the body .
this weevil feeds on the juices of tender bamboo shoots , its larva tunnels inside a bamboo tree .
the most interesting coleoptera are the dung - rollers or the scarab beetles , to which we have already referred earlier .
the scarab is usually a robustly - built ground beetle , black or brown and shiny , with a wide shovel - like head .
it often bears curiously shaped horns above in front .
though the scarab can fly , it is a great walker and often covers great distances in a relatively short time .
unlike most other insects it does not lay hundreds or thousands of eggs , but merely one two .
however , its highly developed maternal and paternal solicitude protects its progeny .
the scarab is popularly called dung - roller beetle , because of its curious habit of rolling into balls the dung of sheep and cow .
the adult scarab is attracted from a distance to the freshly dropped dung of herbivore by its strong sense of smell .
the ball is then pushed on the ground backward , by the hind legs , the beetle itself moving backwards at the same time .
sometimes two beetles may be seen moving a ball together , one pushing it backward and the other dragging it .
the ball is rolled long distances , often up to half a kilometre .
often the single growing point is destroyed , thus totally arresting the growth of the tree and finally killing it .
the larva , however , breeds in manure pits and in other decaying vegetable matter .
a beautiful group of scarabs is the cetonid or the chafer - beetles .
they are of moderate size , with brilliant metallic colours , and diurnal habit , visiting flowers to feed on pollen grains and on tender petals .
naricius and rhomborhinus are two of our common metallic - green cetonids , which occur most frequently near forest areas .
wasps and hornets the mention of wasps and hornets brings to our mind memories of painful stings and angry buzzing of vicious insects .
however , molest one of them ever so slightly , and hundreds of them will at once attack you and inflict painful stings .
in many respects , they differ from all other insects with which we have so far dealt .
both are polymorphic and their colonies contain numerous individuals of imperfect females or workers , perfect females or queens and also males .
owing to their apparent ferocity and the virulence of their stings , they have not been properly studied in india .
they build enormous combs of pure paper on trees , over - hanging rock or in abandoned buildings .
the nests often attain big sizes of three - fourths of metre in diameter and make the stout branches bend with their weight .
the wasps feed on caterpillars , praying mantids , bugs , grasshoppers , beetles , dead snakes and other meat .
bees the bees have been well known in india from time immemorial .
the real problem of the industry was prospecting for new deposits of copperore as the known reserves were assessed at only 34 lakh tons .
while there was no mining at all of tin and nickel ores , that of lead and zinc was insignificant .
the pre - war level was exceeded after 1950 , and in 1952 the output was nearly 1.5 million tons .
while the prospects of a viable copper industry were good , those of lead and zinc were extremely uncertain .
while discovery of new deposits was providential , human ingenuity could make god ' s gifts go a long way . chemicals
the commonest lycaenid butterfly is euchrysops cnejus that occurs throughout india , burma and sri lanka .
it frequents various garden flowers and has a liking for drinking water from damp places .
virachola isocrates is another common dull violet - blue lycaenid butterfly , the caterpillars of which breed inside the pomegranate and tamarind fruits .
other butterflies the apollo butterflies parnassius of the himalaya have their homes amid snow and rarely , if ever , occur at elevations below 3000 m .
the apollo butterflies also occur in europe , northern asia , north america and in the arctic areas .
the amathusid butterflies are usually large , and sombre - coloured , with eye - spots .
the caterpillars breed on palms and on bamboo leaves and the adults are attracted to toddy and other fermenting objects .
discophom lepida is a rare species in south india and sri lanka , with dark brown wings and bluish - white spots .
the morpho - butterfly of south america is important ; its wings are used in jewel inlay works .
neptis is the common sailor that flutters close to the ground .
some moths are only too familiar to us ; they actually occur in our homes !
other moths , though breeding on outdoor plants , regularly visit us at night , attracted by bright white lights .
the chief among these are the noctuids , hawk - moths , saturnids and bombycids .
some of them have wing - span of nearly 10 cm .
some of them are also armed with fleshy horns behind .
the large plump green caterpillar feeds on leaves of sesamum and beans .
deilephila nerii is a dark olive - green and pink coloured moth and is perhaps the largest of the three indian species , mentioned here .
their caterpillars feed on the leaves of diverse plants and the pupae are generally found in soil .
the cockroach the cockroaches belong to an ancient group of insects ; the oldest fossil cockroach belongs to the geological ages more than two hundred million years ago .
the socalled american cockroach periplanea americana is a true citizen of the world and occurs in every home , factory , store , train and ship .
during some warm and oppressive nights before an imminent rainfall , it takes to the wing and flies out in swarms .
in temperate and cold countries , the cockroach avoids flight altogether .
the cockroach lays about two dozen eggs inside an ootheca , curiously resembling a gladstonebag .
the young nymphs are active creatures and generally resemble the adults .
blatta orientalis is somewhat smaller , but has similar habits .
they also mechanically contaminate articles of human food with pathogens of various diseases .
occasionally a cockroach may nibble the tender skin or hairs on the head of a sleeping baby and cause painful sores .
cockroaches have numerous enemies , primarily moles , lizards and birds .
they are heavily parasitized by many parasites , especially protozoa , worms and insects .
they include mayflies , stoneflies , drag - onflies , cockroaches , bugs , beetles , sialid , caddisflies , mosquitoes and gnats , moths , springtails , etc .
some of these are aquatic only as larvae or as pupae , but lead a terrestrial life as adults , while others are aquatic both as larvae and adults .
the air - breathing terrestrial insects have to face many unexpected difficulties and problems if they were to become aquatic .
some of these are rather complex and concern locomotion in water and breathing when submerged .
all aquatic insects have solved them efficiently in many different ways .
the majority of them swim with the help of their hind legs , which have become specialized to function as oars .
many insects swim by jet - propulsion mechanism ; they forcibly expel a powerful stream of water backward from the anus , their body shooting forward .
they have developed special organs for trapping the atmospheric air and for carrying this supply in their body even under water .
most other aquatic insects breathe by means of gills , by utilizing the air dissolved in the water , more or less like fishes .
they are thus independent of the atmospheric air .
the oxygen dissolved in the water is taken in by osmosis in exchange for the carbon dioxide of the blood .
though they live in water , their body is not wetted , because it is coated with a water - proof waxy layer .
a large number of insects are semiaquatic and live habitually at the water ' s edge on banks of ponds , lakes and rivers .
periodically they ! sally forth into the water for hunting , drag the victims to the bank and devour them .
the hydrophilid beetles generally resemble the dytiscids , but are vegetarians .
the caddisworm presents some of the most intriguing problems in habits , instinct , adaptation and animal distribution and animal psychology .
the caddisworm is a delicate caterpillar - like larva , with three pairs of legs on its thorax and few filamentous and delicate gills for breathing .
its tail end has a powerful hook , by means of which the larva adheres itself to the inside of its cabin .
as it grows in size , it enlarges its case .
in order to obtain a fresh supply of air , the larvae and pupae rise to the surface of the water and remain suspended from the surface film .
the larva swims by the lashing movements of the slender abdomen .
it has a brush - like structure near its mouth , with which it sets up a current of water , drawing the food particles into the mouth .
it feeds on dead organic matter , algae , micro - organisms and various other small solid particles .
some larvae are cannibalistic and attack the smaller larvae .
the pupa also swims by the paddling action of tail fins .
the swarms penetrate eritrea , spain and portugal in the west and often in the east as far as calcutta .
the locust has normally two generations in a year .
the eggs incubate for about 15 - 40 days and the immature hoppers stage lasts for about 40 - 60 days .
their ancestry is not at all indian !
some ants and bumblebees ( but not honeybees ) also live habitually at high altitudes .
the streams fed by the melting snow and ice are inhabited by the larvae of mayflies , stoneflies , caddisflies and dipterous flies .
the common himalayan mayflies are baetis and the stoneflies belong to nemura , capnia , etc .
they together produced 4,384 coaches during 1951 - 56 , necessitating import of only 497 coaches .
by 1950 the railways had succeeded in overcoming the serious bottlenecks in their working .
punctuality and utilisation of rolling stock improved considerably .
the third project was the kandla - deesa lines completed in 1950 - 52 .
these various schemes of construction , replacement and improvement cost the railways a heavy sum .
the larva of the codling moth damages apples .
the rice - weevil calandra oryzae and the granary weevil calandra granaria spoil rice and wheat in storage .
the problem of crop damage by injurious insects is thus rather complex in our country .
in addition to the numerous insects , which attack crops , fruits , vegetables and stored products , there are those which transmit various diseases in man .
until recently the lac dye was used for cloth dyeing in our country .
the manna mentioned in the bible , is the dried and solidified honeydew secreted by the bug trabutina , living on the tamarisk tree .
the aquatic larvae of mayflies and even the mosquitoes are useful as food of many valued edible fishes .
the flowers may indeed be grouped on the basis of the insects that visit them for cross - pollination .
to this category belong , for example , the flowers of scrophularia , iris , primula , aconitum , labiatae , many orchids , papilionaceae , etc .
the short tongued honeybees cannot reach the nectaries at the bottom of the long corolla and are thus effectively discouraged .
lilies , phlox , dtan - thus , etc . are some of the typical butterfly flowers and lonicera , saponaria , etc . are among the typical mothflowers .
india has been cultivated for at least seven thousand years , if not more .
the settler in america took with them to the new country many of the old world crops .
the crops introduced there soon attracted the attention of native american insects , which spread and became ' pests ' rapidly .
when the old world plants and their insects went to america , the predators and parasites were left behind and denied entry in america .
there has not been enough time to bring about a natural equilibrium between the cultivator and the insects in america , as has been the case in india .
the ' pests ' is thus a creation of modern man ' s folly .
it is these beneficial insects which have laboured to maintain the equilibrium undisturbed .
how then can you blame the insects if as a result of the death of the beneficial species , the equilibrium is upset ?
there is another widespread popular misconception in india .
we seem to think that if there were no insects , we could grow more food than at present .
when all is said and done , man is a debtor to insects .
in truth , both are equally successful and lead to the same result .
as a matter of fact , the partition could be said to be the british government ' s clumsy answer to the ferment .
it had hoped to contain the ferment by partitioning the troublesome province .
the ferment became more widespread and intense and in the end the partition had to be annulled .
it is difficult to say when he actually joined it , but it must be some time in 1904 .
he and hail kumar chakravarty became members of the samity together . "
it was after a year or so that they must have met jadugopal mukherjee .
naren and hari kumar were sent to orissa for famine relief work .
their work was satisfactory and they were admitted into the inner circle after their return to calcutta .
by this time naren had left his home and was staying in calcutta at the headquarters of the anushilan samity at 49 , cornwallis street .
about this time , he came in closer contact with barin ghosh who had already started the bengali daily , the jugan - tar .
naren helped barin ghosh in looking after the daily and is reported to h . ve written some articles for the newspaper .
it fell into the hands of the police after which he was arrested .
soon after joining the revolutionary movement , naren was initiated into the art of shooting and bomb - making .
bullets and bombs were the main instruments of the revolutionaries .
about this time naren came in contact with jatin - dranath mukherjee .
about a year earlier , naren committed the first political dacoity in the province .
the dacoity was committed at the chingripota railway station on 6 december 1907 .
the station - master was assaulted and money in the safe of his office was taken away .
in the couple of years that followed , naren committed everal political dacolties but little definite information is available about them .
one about which a little information is available is the dacoity at netra , near diamond harbour in the district of 24 parganas .
it was committed on 25 april 1909 .
it was a plan of armed insurrection .
for some time he became a sanyosi .
as a sanyasi it was easier to move about without arousing the suspicion of the police .
some revolutionary leaders had become sanyasis and some of naren ' s colleagues thought that he was following in their footsteps .
his constant search for holy men might have strengthened their suspicion .
during those days naren visited places like banaras , allahabad , agra and mathura .
after his release from jail , naren took up employment also as a coveras agent of the ' india equitable assurance company ' .
jatin mukherjee was in those days staying outside calcutta and working as a contractor .
there were already two such establishments in calcutta ,
a few days later a meeting was held in banaras to discuss the plan of the insurrection .
the meeting was attended by rashbehary bose , jatin mukher - jee , naren , amrendranath chattopadhyaya and atulkrishna ghosh .
it was in march 1915 that the revolutionaries received intimation that germany was willing to send arms .
along with the intimation came the suggestion to send a representative to batavia to discuss details .
the revolutionaries were elated by the prospect of getting arms .
naren left india for java in april 1915 in search of arms . he did not get the arms that he was looking for .
moreover , the average recovery was declining and , at less than 10 per cent , it was very unsatisfactory .
here again , the main producing provinces of up and bihar had figures even lower than the country ' s average .
the indian central sugarcane committee launched in 1948 programmes for improvement in yield and was doing useful work .
but its pace was too slow to make a dent in the problem .
it was being realised that the locational aspect of the industry ' s development was badly neglected .
one of the remedies to the problems of the industry was to take it to the tropical regions of south india which were ideally suited for sugarcane production .
but the story of migration of the industry to its new prosperous home belongs to the era of planning .
the factories varied widely in size from 50 tons to 2,000 tons of cane - crushing capacity per day .
with this idea in view , they decided to hold up the three main railways into bengal by blowing up the principal bridges .
they were to be smuggled through the north - eastern frontiers , where the abors had risen in revolt only recently .
after naren ' s departure , a disaster befell his party resulting in the fieroic death of his leader , jatindranath mukherjee .
naren ' s suggestion was that the chinese rebels should pass on some of those arms to indian revolutionaries across the border .
sun yat - sen liked the idea and asked naren to get five million dollars from the german ambassador for the purchase of those arms .
at last perhaps in a few months , the dream of appearing on the frontiers of india with arms enough to raise an army might be fulfilled . "
the german ambassador sent naren on to the new world on his way to berlin .
he therefore advised naren to proceed to berlin and place his plan before ' the supreme war lord and his general staff ' .
admiral von hintze was then the german ambassador in china .
the plan was approved and roy was asked to go to china to pursue it .
roy was not keen on going , but he agreed to go by ' force of habit ' .
later the plan fell through as the japanese steamer by which roy was to go failed to arrive .
he then returned to mexico city and then began to look around for the political work that he wanted to do .
the contact with the german officers helped roy in two ways .
since the bolsheviks captured power , russian gold went to all the corners of the world , far and near , to promote the communist movement .
in the first few years of his career in the communist international , there was recognition of this financial help received from roy .
the controversy thus went on from time to time and no final decision was reached until stalin liquidated the comintern in 1943 .
the second congress established roy ' s position in the comintern .
he went to moscow as an ordinary delegate .
at the end of the congress , roy would have been elected to the executive committee of the comintern .
he declined the honour as he was to go east after the congress , " perhaps never to return " .
based on sal wood and bamboo , the nepa mills ' product did not compare favourably with imported paper made of conventional raw materials .
the industry had three major problems to tackle .
first , it still did not meet the country ' s need of paper , particularly of certain finer varieties and of newsprint .
a unit of 100 - ton - a - day capacity was thought to be of an economic size , but many units had smaller capacities than that .
closer co - ordination between the paper and sugar industries was clearly indicated if the by - products of expanding sugar industry were to be profitably exploited .
early in 1927 the comintern sent roy to china as its representative to supervise the implementation of a new thesis that it had adopted .
roy had a big hand in drafting the thesis that was adopted by ecci at its meeting in moscow in november 1926 .
the comintern and the russian government had been taking keen interest in developments in china for a long time .
a couple of years later , the kuomintang was reorganised and , on moscow ' s advice , communists entered it .
the expedition petered out in the end and paved the way for reconciliation between the two wings of the kuomintang .
in his speeches on the issue , roy showed a remarkable grasp of the military , political and social situation in the country .
even the anti - imperialist struggle was suspended for avoiding international complications .
in some places the peasants took possession of the lands they were cultivating for the landlords .
in other places they drove away the landlords .
roy disagreed with all these theoretical and policy formulations and expressed his dissent against them in clear and unambiguous terms .
a meeting of the plenum of the ecci was held in moscow in february 1928 to discuss the chinese problem .
roy thought that it would give him an opportunity to put forward his point of view .
he fell ill with a serious ailment of the ear while the meeting was going on .
it is surmised that it was done with the help of bukharin .
but for the flight , roy might have been one of the innumerable victims of stalin ' s anger .
what was more important was the new line that was adopted .
all these directives , political and trade union , were unrealistic and disruptive .
members of the cpgb who had expressed dissent were forced to capitulate and a year later a new leadership was imposed .
the idea was to secure the acceptance of the manifesto by rank and file congressmen and by youth leaguers and others .
roy followed in the middle of december 1930 .
he got down from a ship in karachi on december 11 and then made his way to bombay .
the british police had kept a watch on his activities in europe .
the indian police were intimated and they began to look for him all over the country .
he knew that he would have to spend a few years in jail .
that was the penalty , he knew , he would have to pay for getting the opportunity of working freely and openly for indian freedom .
he did not want to offer himself for arrest , nor did he want to run away to far - off places to avoid it .
roy was able to avoid arrest for about seven months .
he was arrested in bombay on 21 july 1931 .
in bombay , roy was going about then under the name of dr mahmood .
and the most important thing that he did before his arrest was the setting up of the roy group in bombay and a few other places .
the roy group consisted of young , enthusiastic workers in the congress and the trade union and youth movements .
they acquired that name because they accepted roy ' s programme and were influenced by his personality and achievements .
to counteract this development , it sent in 1930 to 1932 a number of agents .
even then the communists were not able to make any headway .
when roy returned , the civil disobedience movement was already on the decline .
the roy group tried to stop the decline through agitation and propaganda amongst congressmen on the lines of the roy manifesto .
it set up for the purpose organisations like youth leagues , nayjawan bharat sabhas and independence of india committees .
in the end , the movement was withdrawn on the basis of the gandhi - irwin pact .
one royist , taiyab shaikh , made a spirited speech in support of the amendment , but it did not receive any support .
later , gandhiji attended the round table conference as the sole representative of the congress .
roy was happy to find that as a result of this propaganda and other activities , a number of left - wing congressmen were getting attracted to his group .
owing to fall in the prices of agricultural commodities , the peasants were in distress .
they found it difficult to pay rents to landlords .
owing to the efforts of jawaharlal nehru and others , the congress had spread into the villages .
he moved about then in khadi clothes and was known by the name of banerji .
the trade union movement was in disarray when roy arrived .
the other hurdle was his blunt opposition to the gandhian programme and leadership .
in spite of these hurdles , he achieved a good deal even though he was constantly hunted by the police .
at last the police caught up with him and , as stated earlier , he was arrested in bombay on 21 july 1931 .
he was immediately taken to kanpur to stand trial for his part in the kanpur communist conspiracy .
his trial took place in jail as the government was anxious to avoid public demonstrations .
the sentence of transportation for twelve years inflicted upon him was also savage compared to the sentence of four years ' imprisonment imposed in 1924 .
it was later reduced in appeal to six years ' imprisonment .
imperialism had at last succeeded in imprisoning its biggest foe whom it had been hunting since 1915 .
roy was in jail and incapable , it thought , of doing any further ' mischief at least for the next few years .
he established contact with the outside world within a week or two of his imprisonment .
roy utilised the contact for sending out letters , manifestos , articles and even manuscripts of a couple of books .
china in revolt published under the pen name s . k . vidyarthi in 1935 was smuggled out of jail .
it was republished in 1941 in roy ' s name as my experiences in china .
the defence statement that he was not allowed to make was similarly taken out and published as my defence .
amongst the letters that he sent out , the most well - known are letters to the congress socialist party .
it is on record that he sent a couple of letters to jawaharlal nehru , a few others are also noted .
ordinarily , roy was a well - behaved prisoner .
he obeyed all rules ; he did his allotted work without fail .
but he had decided from the beginning not to obey one rule , the rule not to maintain any contact with the outside world .
it was by breaking that rule that he was able to send out material for publication and for guidance of those who were looking up to him for leadership .
officially , roy was allowed to write only one letter a month . lts length was - prescribed and sometimes passages were struck out .
they were published in 1941 as letters from jail .
it throws light on the non - political and human sides of roy .
life in jail shattered roy ' s health .
he was proud of his ' iron constitution ' , but it could not stand the rigours of jail life that were imposed upon him .
the most oppressive was the summer heat . he had to stand it for the first three years in kanpur and bareilly .
' the next year he was taken to dehra dun when the weather became hot and kept there until his release .
roy suffered from dilation of heart and pain in the chest and slow fever from time to time .
after conviction he was b class . even the classification was not changed in spite of many representations by the prisoner and his friends outside .
in spite of his ill - health , roy did plenty of writing in jail of a strictly legal nature .
for the writing he was supplied one bound notebook at a time with pages numbered and authenticated .
a new notebook would be supplied only after the first one was deposited .
this was most unsatisfactory for carrying on any serious study .
despite this difficulty , roy filled with his writing nine such notebooks of about a thousand pages each .
a good part of what he wrote was published later as books .
fascism , materialism , historical role of islam , ideals of indian womanhood are amongst the books that were made from those hand - written notebooks .
it consists of roy ' s writings on philosophical consequences of modern science .
the arrest of roy did not kill the roy group .
it continued and developed both in the political and trade union fields .
yet , by the end of 1934 , roy ' s new followers had shown excellent results .
the attuc was gradually reassuming the former position as leader and organiser of the trade union movement in the country . "
he inspired and guided his followers even from jail .
the progress of the communist movement in india in subsequent years has shown how right were the tactics that roy advocated . "
roy kept himself remarkably well informed about the political situation in the country and abroad .
many changes had taken place during his period of imprisonment .
on release he did not have to ask , as usual , time for considering the situation .
he jumped into the arena without any hesitation to continue the political work which prison walls had failed to stop .
roy was released from the dehra dun jail on the morning of 20 november 1936 after an imprisonment lasting five years and four months .
he was received at the jail gate by a couple of congress leaders , but a demonstration was avoided because of the weak condition of his health .
after release , roy was taken to the residence of khurshid lal , chairman of the municipality , and prominent congress leader .
some of roy ' s associates from various parts of the country had also collected there to meet him and welcome him back in their midst .
he was very happy to meet them .
i am of the opinion that simple talk about independence will not take us far towards the much - coveted goal .
our immediate objective is not socialism ; but it is a mistake to place political freedom and establishment of socialism in water - tight compartments of history .
i shall place before the nationalist movement a clear programme of democratic revolution , accompanied with a concrete plan of action .
that is the only way towards a more effective struggle against imperialism .
those engaged in the struggle must know exactly what they are fighting for .
we cannot go very far with propaganda and agitation .
political consciousness of the masses should be developed .
this spell of prosperity did not last long .
conditions were becoming increasingly unfavourable to the industry as the war appeared to draw to a close .
controls had their effect , albeit delayed , on prices .
wages were rising as they were linked , in most centres , to the cost of living .
the prices of other inputs like coal , oil , cotton , etc . were increasing .
the upward trend in costs , which started towards the end of 1944 , had a snowball effect in the post - war years .
british masters would be replaced by german or japanese masters .
what roy foretold came true , but was not at that time believed by the nationalists .
at the time the sentiment in the country was predominantly anti - british and therefore pro - fascist .
it was fomented by the csp , the cp . the forward bloc and other leftists and also by militant nationalists in the congress .
the government was suspicious not only of the congress but also of others like the radicals who offered unconditional support to the war .
the experience of history is that atomised individual voters cannot make democracy prevail .
organised democracy will eliminate the difficulties of holding elections in a vast country .
it makes combination of the legislative and executive functions of the state possible .
the separation of these two functions has invariably vitiated democratic practice and reduced sovereignty of the people to a mere formality . "
only on the basis of such a relation can a really democratic constitution be operated . "
in conclusion it asserted : " out of the melting pot of the war , a new world will rise .
this draft presents a picture of that new india . "
man created society in order to be able to wage successfully his struggle for existence .
in those days it was not possible for them to trace the relationship of man to nature .
modern science has removed that difficulty .
humanism can now go to the root and that is why roy has called his humanism ' radical humanism ' .
the journey towards radical humanism was not an easy journey .
roy had t6 discard many ideas that he had accepted as true during the communist phase of his life .
the journey was like an adventure in the field of ideas .
there are two points in his later political thinking which deserve special mention .
one is his insistence on partyless politics .
capture of power , then , becomes their sole aim and any means are resorted to attain that aim .
heavily absorbed in this literary work and also the work of developing the radical humanist movement , roy needed some rest .
he went for rest to mussoorie in june 1952 .
they used to go out as usual for their morning walk .
he sustained grave injuries and had to be in bed for several weeks .
but in august there was another attack of cerebral thrombosis .
it came as a big shock to colleagues , co - workers and friends alike in india and abroad .
but a higher standard of material life has a cultural content only when it is imbued with , or serves as a means of attaining some ultimate moral value .
so civilisation is not always an ally but sometimes an enemy of culture .
history shows us many instances in which an old degenerate civilisation had to be weeded out so that true culture could thrive anew .
nationhood as a political concept is not quite new ; but it has acquired a new significance in modern europe .
the early fifties saw scarcities converted into surpluses , as observed earlier , and the loss of market in the wake of partition was now keenly felt .
policies to promote exports were clearly called for .
exports , responding to these measures , rose to 703 million yards in 1953 .
the excise duty of 10 per cent on medium cloth was also withdrawn , so that its offtake might improve .
the production of finer yam above count 50 increased from 15 million ib in the pre - war years to 88 million ib in 1948 .
since the ' production pattern was frozen between 1939 and 1940 , most of this change was effected during 1946 - 48 .
india was passing through such a period before the national movement heralded a new age .
the ramifications of the caste system , much more rigid and complicated than the simple varnashram of the ancient period , was dominating the whole social and cultural life .
it showed itself at its worst at the time of elections for the local and higher legislative bodies .
class , party , nation , country and in some cases , even religion , counted for nothing .
along with race , religion also had a bad name as a dividing force .
on the other hand , the spirit of ' tribalism ' linguistic parochialism , and so - called religious communalism are acting as dividing forces .
once this point is cleared up , there is no doubt that india is fully capable of achieving lasting national unity .
all that physical and historical forces could do to create the necessary preconditions for such a unity has been done .
what is now required is a conscious effort to promote the forces of unity and to put down those of division and disunity .
iv all these conditions which we have so far discussed are necessary but not sufficient to make a nation .
the reason why this intolerance , which is against all indian tradition , has affected so many people , is that it appears in the guise of patriotism .
the price of unity , like that of liberty , is eternal watchfulness .
the majorities in truly democratic countries which hold ruling power as a sacred trust have always to be on the alert .
but in the course of these discussions we will come across another vital problemthe struggle between the old and the new which is raging in our minds today .
obviously it is not possible to do justice to this problem in this book .
it requires a separate book .
there are two different sets of theories about the origin of culture the idealistic and the materialistic .
philosophers and historians subscribe to some form of the one or the other or make an attempt to harmonise them .
the latter class of theories say that the starting - point of culture is the physical environment .
ideas , theories and beliefs are not bound to any particular locality .
in every country we find different types of ideas and beliefs , but the concrete aspect of the culture determined by the geographical and social conditions is the same .
leaving aside a few cold regions , the climate in the entire country is temperate during one part of the year and hot during the other part .
in some years parts of the country receive no rainfall at all .
that is why , from time immemorial , agriculture has been the main occupation of the people in india .
we meet manifestations of this spirit throughout the history of indian culture .
this was not so in the warmer countries and consequently economic urges have played a comparatively smaller role in the evolution of indian culture .
no one would deny the fact that the material aspect of indian culture is also moulded on the pattern of its physical and economic environment .
this direct effect of the physical environment on the development of their physique is fairly obvious .
but its indirect effect on their temperament and character , on their mental , social and moral life is not so apparent .
this culture is believed to have reached its zenith about 3000 bc .
so it should be counted among the oldest cultures of the world along with those of elam , sumeria , babylonia , ancient egypt and ancient china .
no other country except china affords an example of a civilisation continuing without a break for such a long time .
all that we can say on the strength of the available material is that their religious beliefs and practices are to some extent reflected in hinduism .
we will find later that the dravidians made an important contribution to the national culture of india .
there is a legend that he was an aryan preacher from the north who had come to south india to propagate the vedic religion .
his twelve disciples wrote a large number of treatises on grammar , literature , music , dance , etc .
one of these treatises tolkappiam , written about 1000 bc is still extant .
it deals essentially in prehistoric times south india , the present home of dravidian culture , extended very far to the south of the present peninsula .
dravidians had their own script , numerals and calendar .
but the only thing which can be said with certainty is that they came to india from the north - west .
the hymns to their gods , which they composed probably after they had come to india , were later collected in the rig veda .
the rig veda is not only a holy scripture of hinduism but also the earliest document of indian history .
most historians think that the hymns of the rig veda were composed between 1500 bc and 1000 bc .
so it is called the period of vedic culture .
later , social distinctions became more pronounced and rigid .
that is to say the father was regarded as the head of the heritage passed from father to son .
sheep and goats were also kept and horses were used for drawing war chariots .
fields were manured and irrigated in various ways .
rope - walkers , jugglers , fortune - tellers , flute - players and dancers were also thriving .
but the remarkable thing is that though there was so much economic progress there is no mention of metal coins in the vedic literature .
the greatest progress in this age centred round religious and philosophical thought as seen in the upanishads .
there is no evidence to show that writing was common in those days .
as we have said before , religion in this period developed in two directions .
among minor gods the dravidian nagaraja and some others were also included in the pantheon .
the latter way , which the aryan mind adopted in the peculiar indian environment specially conducive to meditation , was quite new .
but they conceive of god as the spirit pervading the universe .
they have tried to give their own unitarian interpretation of the belief in many gods and to sacrifices offered to them .
this was the first idea of unitism which the indian mind put before the world 3000 years ago .
since then to the time of hegel , philosophical and religious thought has done a great deal of hairsplitting on the subject .
most of the uneconomic units were located in west bengal and madras .
the handloom sector had its own problems as also those in common with the organised mill industry .
the decentralised sector comprised khadi , handloom and powerloom production .
the handloom sector , too , which had been languishing for decades , received a fresh breath of air after independence .
what these traditional pursuits needed was not a little short - term succour , but a lasting solution .
the case in its favour was conceded by all , but the solution of its problem was neither easy nor quick .
increasing use of power , mechanisation and cooperatives were suggested , but there seemed at the time no well - thought - out plans for achieving these objectives .
this was of course a freak and , as should have been expected , the next year exports were back to their old level .
they improved to 797,000 tons in 1951 - 52 and further to 852,000 tons in 1954 - 55 .
this shows that the increase in export earnings was only partly due to higher exports in kind .
unit prices of exports were also moving up particularly up to 1951 - 52 .
the increasing level of exports before partition was made possible by an increasing supply of raw jute .
imports from pakistan , though never adequate or stable , were totally suspended , following the devaluation of the indian rupee in september 1949 .
faced with a challenge , this country set about growing all the jute its industry needed ; and the results could be described as only spectacular .
however , the yield per acre fell continuously during the post - war decade , but it improved in 1955 - 56 .
this could be explained by the almost indiscriminate extension of the area under cultivation .
dependence on imports from pakistan , though now greatly reduced , was still considerable .
exports of raw jute , which were once substantial , were almost entirely eliminated after partition .
the industry ' s capacity as well as output did not show any marked improvement over these years .
there were 107 mills in 1938 - 39 , with 68,000 looms and 1,350,000 spindles .
in 1955 there were more than 72,000 looms .
the capacity , however , was not fully utilised even on a single - shift basis .
but even then there were , in 1948 , forty - two railway systems consisting of varying numbers of class i , class ii and class iii railways .
rational regrouping of railways was suggested , recommended and pressed for from time to time beginning with the turn of the present century .
the acworth committee , followed by the inchape committee , lent powerful support to this demand , but there was nothing by way of concrete action .
it was finally in free india that the proposal to regroup railways was put through .
however , the growth of roads seemed slower in relation to the transport needs represented by the number of vehicles .
the statistics of road mileage for earlier years too are not quite authentic .
this was altogether a new line of production , untried so far in the country .
bullet - proof steel , which was found necessary for the armoured carriers , was also successfully developed .
this was how the ' tatanagar ' , the armoured carrier manufactured by the company for the government , came to be perfected .
the tatas ' jnventive genius was again in evidence later , when they successfully developed quality mint die steel .
imports of such steel became impossible as the war progressed , and the result was a shortage of small coins .
the research and control laboratory at jamshedpur had these and many other developments to its credit during the war years .
the alloy steel with the greatest strategic value , viz . tungsten high speed steel , was vital for the manufacture of guns and ammunition .
but india had a limited capacity for this , and had to depend on imported ferro - tungsten , which was scarce .
the tatas succeeded in reducing from wolfram ore sufficient quantities of high - grade ferro - tungsten .
the company added in 1941 - 42 the wheel , tyre and axle ( wta ) plant as a war measure .
this plant was a forerunner of the manufacture in the country of locomotives , coaches and wagons .
profits of the company kept soaring during the war as well as in the immediate post - war years .
the partition of the country , fortunately , did not affect the industry at all .
a large part of the profits was ploughed back to support expansion in production , continuous innovations and new lines of production .
efficiency was generally maintained , if not improved , but wear and tear of equipment was faster than it was advisable to allow .
the results of working of the company for the years 1940 - 41 to 1947 - 48 , are summarised in table 7.16 .
for comparison , the data for the previous five years is also reproduced .
hence , a modest modernisation and expansion programme ( mep ) was launched in 1951 .
in either case , the question of ensuring a ' fair price ' to industry was involved directly or indirectly .
in the beginning , the controls were imposed through informal negotiations between government and the tata steel company .
the assembling capacity for cars and trucks before the war was less than 30,000 annually .
it was more than doubled during the years 1946 - 50 .
but production was only 6,588 cars and 8,016 trucks in 1950 .
following the recommendations of the tariff commission , steps were taken in the early fifties for the progressive manufacture of automobiles in the country .
about half of them were private cars .
the automobile ancillary industries were somewhat slow in coming up .
thermal power , which dominated before 1960 , lost ground in subsequent years as major hydel projects were commissioned .
but in recent years the pace of expanson of hydel power has slowed down .
moreover , hydel projects have long gestation periods .
power generation based on coal is , therefore , an obvious option before the nation .
it was , therefore , decided in the fifth plan to set up super thermal stations of large capacity , located close to coal - fields .
they were expected to generate cheaper power , having the advantages of economy of scale and favourable location .
for the planning and construction of these stations , the national thermal power corporation ( ntpc ) was set up in 1975 .
a number of super thermal stations such as at singrauli , korba , farakka , ramagundam , neyveli , etc . have since been commissioned .
the oil arid petroleum industry must be considered a ' discovery ' of the planning era .
refining capacity and the production of petroleum products also expanded more than four - and - a - half times between 1955 - 56 and 1968 - 69 .
the exploration of oil resources received special attention in the second plan .
the oil and natural gas commission ( ongc ) was set up to undertake geological surveys , investigation and exploration drilling .
exploration carried out with canadian technical assistance under the colombo plan had not borne fruit .
the indo - stanvac petroleum project meant for exploration of oil in the west bengal basin also proved a failure .
the prospects of finding oil in the country looked dim .
bombay high gave new hope to the country ' s oil industry .
but for the policy of conserving non - renewable resources , the pace of indigenous oil production would have been quicker .
the guwahati and barauni refineries were the first to be commissioned .
the koyali refinery was established in the third plan and the kochin refinery thereafter .
the refinery at madras was completed in the fourth plan and the capacities of old refineries expanded .
as a result , the refining capacity went up from 16 million tonnes to 21 million tonnes at the end of the plan .
the consumption of petroleum products increased nearly five - fold from a little over 5 million tonnes in 1956 to about 24 million tonnes in 1973 .
the encouragement to personalised transport in preference to the declared policy of emphasising mass public transport is an ill - advised step .
in the transport infrastructure of the economy , the railway system has been playing and will continue to play a key role .
in addition to this general objective , the railway expansion programme has been oriented to meet specific developmental problems encountered from time to time .
the orientation of the first five - year plan was , as we have already seen , rehabilitation and modernisation of the railways .
in the second five - year plan , the railways had to be geared to the requirements of the new steel plants and higher production of coal .
the early fifties saw the emergence of a unit each for the manufacture of cylinder liners , piston rings , pistons and sparking plugs .
over half the fleet was more than twenty years old .
india ' s share in coastal trade before the war was only 33 per cent .
it increased to 53 per cent in 1948 and further to 75 per cent in 1949 .
in the fourth five - year plan , the basic thrust of railway development was towards modernisation and improvement of efficiency .
the plan provided , therefore , for investment to improve productivity rather than for expansion of the network .
it was expected that better utilisation of the existing capacity and modernisation would meet the projected traffic demand in the plan .
as a result , the policy on new lines followed since the first five - year plan has been extremely conservative .
new lines were provided only when " they were justified by operational considerations or new industrial projects .
the rapidly expanding commerce , trade and industry made heavy demands on railways , especially during the first three plan periods .
they could not take the traffic offered .
overcrowding and outstanding registrations kept increasing .
the economic recession in the late sixties left the railways with some slack and the fourth plan target was reached through better utilisation of rolling stock .
thus a plateau was reached and the goods traffic carried by the railways remained stagnant around 200 million tonnes during the decade 1965 - 75 .
originating freight traffic on railways was projected to reach 309 million tonnes in 1984 - 85 .
the railways could , however , carry only 265 million tonnes in 1984 - 85 .
in the eighties severe infrastructural constraints developed including those in railway transport .
wagons were not available in time or in required numbers even for priority movement of coal , fertilisers or cement .
in the meantime , more and heavier vehicles have started plying , making road conditions worse .
one of the major criticisms of the rural roads programmes has been that they are ' fair - weather roads programmes ' .
road transport has come to play a predominant role in the economy ' s infrastructure .
its share of non - bulk , short - distance freight and passenger traffic has been growing both in absolute and relative terms .
the expanding earnings were an indication of the more intensive use of the available railway facilities .
the partition of the country only further accentuated these problems .
the assam railway was cut off from the rest of the railway network and construction of a new rail link became an urgent necessity .
some 30 per cent of them were over - age in 1949 .
the result was high cost of maintenance and repairs , engine failures and general operational inefficiency .
some 1,000 locomotives were ordered from abroad to retrieve the position .
but the most important development in regard to meeting the locomotive needs of the country was the commissioning of the chittaranjan locomotive works in 1950 .
the country had , in the past , manufactured locomotives in the railway workshops , but this was the first large - scale manufacture being undertaken .
the public demand for a locomotive factory was as old as the first world war , when difficulties were experienced in the import of locomotives .
the demand had been voiced from time to time in the later years , but there was no response from the authorities .
finally , in 1939 , a committee was set up to report on the feasibility of locomotive manufacture in india .
the indian cotton mill industry not only spearheaded the country ' s march towards industrialisation , but had the pride of place in the global context .
it ranked first in the world in spindle capacity , third in yarn production and export of textiles and fourth in cotton consumption .
as a consequence , there has been phenomenal expansion in the decentralised sector , particularly , the powerloom sector .
it is unlikely that the number of handlooms has changed much over the years ; if anything , quite a few might have become decrepit .
powerlooms would be compulsorily registered and would be subjected to all the rules and laws to which the mills were subject .
the rest of the mills must face unequal competition with the powerlooms for the non - elite market .
but then what happens to the other objectives of textile policy , like provision of quality cloth to the masses at reasonable prices ?
cotton accounts for over half the cost of production of cloth .
the fluctuations in the output of cotton have an important bearing on availability and price .
output slumped to a mere 40 lakh tonnes in 1979 - 80 , converting , overnight as it were , a situation of glut into one of serious shortage .
the eighties must be considered as a phase of high growth , but the year - to - year fluctuations were still substantial .
but then there was a sharp decline to 59 lakh tonnes the following year and 61 lakh tonnes in 1984 - 85 .
it improved to 70 lakh tonnes in 1985 - 86 and then sharply rose to 85 lakh tonnes in 1986 - 87 .
between 1973 - 74 and 1976 - 77 exports provided a profitable outlet for our sugar surpluses .
the world commodity boom brought about a spurt in international demand and world sugar prices spurted .
and in 1977 - 78 exports amounted only to 71,000 tonnes .
to deal with the situation , the government announced a package of relief measures .
. off - season excise rebate ;
however , with no better prospects of exports in sight and no significant increase in offtake internally , sugar prices came under great pressure .
the government announced its intention to build a buffer stock of 5 lakh tonnes .
another related aspect is the regulation of the khandsari and gur industry .
sugarcane cultivation is also encroaching on land under other crops , like paddy .
cultural paper consisting of writing and printing variety constituted nearly 60 per cent of the total production .
industrial paper comprising wrapping and packing paper constituted 20 per cent .
demand for paper and paperboard increased at an annual rate of 8 - 10 per cent during the fifties .
in fact , consumption had to be kept down through restrictions on imports .
a joint sector project in karnataka with a capacity of 75,000 tonnes was also under implementation .
however , the government took the attitude of wait and watch .
eventually it lifted all controls from the fiscal year 1989 - 90 .
there is enormous potential demand for housing , roads and other construction .
the rural market has been by and large neglected .
marketing poses a serious challenge to the industry .
cost and quality become crucial as availability improves .
on the part of the government , there is much to do by way of providing a policy frame to encourage construction , particularly infrastructure and housing .
capacity utilisation declined from over 70 per cent in 1968 - 69 to below 65 per cent in 1973 - 74 .
the public sector plants were particularly plagued by one ailment or the other .
the durgapur plant must be singled out as a particularly unlucky unit constantly suffering on account of , among other things , disturbed industrial relations .
if it was not labour trouble , there were breakdowns due to power cut , poor condition of the coke ovens or faulty equipment .
a major mishap was the collapse of the roof of the melting shop in 1971 which affected the operation of the entire plant for months .
the hsl plants thus worked at a low - capacity utilisation ratio throughout the fourth plan period .
bhilai was an exception registering over 75 per cent utilisation .
passenger mileage flown by the indian airlines in 1948 was about 178 million , which was 1.35 per cent of the total world traffic .
freight carried by air in the same year was 262.5 million long miles .
india ' s share in the world air services constituted only 1.2 per cent of the total .
government had drawn up a post - war development plan for air transport , but it was more a scheme for control and regulation than for development .
by the end of 1949 , as many as nine companies had been granted licences to operate internal air services .
even a good linkage of the semi - conductor complex ltd . ( scl ) with consumers in the country has not been achieved .
consumption of plastics has been increasing very fast in spite of various constraints , but this trend may not continue , unless there is a proper price policy .
phosphatic fertilisers have not become as popular as nitrogenous fertilisers because the results of their application are not as impressive .
from the national point of view , the constraint on increasing the production of phosphatic fertilisers is the limited availability of raw materials .
for balanced application , it is essential to encourage the use of phosphatic and potassic fertilisers along with nitrogenous fertilisers .
plants at gorakhpur , sindri , barauni , namrup and durgapur were set in the sixties or earlier .
in addition to their age , some of them are early examples of the application of indigenous engineering and equipment which were still at the experimental stage .
it was a pioneering effort and in the nature of things , there were many shortcomings in the design of equipment .
in spite of subsequent modifications , the inherent defects could not be overcome and the operations of the plant could not be significantly improved .
the four units of hfc are all in the eastern region and , as such , have been further afflicted by unfavourable , industrial relations .
durgapur and namrup have been closed since 1988 and haldia and barauni were already non - functional .
apart from the chronic case of sindri , the gorakhpur unit is also obsolete and the scheme for its modernisation is under implementation .
the initial mistakes apart , the country has built expertise for technology , process design and equipment supply .
indian consultants have been associated with fertiliser projects from the beginning .
indigenous consultancy agencies have also been starved of funds for r &amp; d work .
this implied a compound rate of growth of 7 per cent as compared to 3.3 per cent for the preceding half century .
the expansion of the basic and producer goods industries in the third plan was even more pronounced than in the past five years .
the increase in the production of textiles and sugar , on the other hand , was only 20 and 13 per cent , respectively .
the next two years were admittedly bad .
production increased by 6.2 per cent in 1968 - 69 and further by 6.5 per cent in 1969 - 70 .
the recession hit both textile and food industries on the one hand , and metal and machinery industries on the other .
this was a serious loss .
much detailed information is available for this period and the index numbers with 1960 as base give a time series which lends itself to such analysis .
the new index number of industrial production with 1970 as base was adopted in 1973 .
the general index of industrial production recorded an increase of over 100 per cent between 1961 and 1973 .
among the consumer non - durable group , industries which enjoyed high weightage and are also important for the common man had generally a poor record .
but for the entire period 1961 - 73 its growth rate was only 2.8 per cent per year .
tea with a weight of 5.12 recorded nominal growth in sixties .
there was considerable improvement in the seventies with a rate of growth at 6.8 per cent per annum in 1969 - 73 .
the growth rate for the entire period 1961 - 73 was 3 per cent .
however , the weight given to the industry , though higher in the new index than before , was not substantial .
the output of agricultural tractors grew at a high rate of 15 per cent , but this industry too enjoyed insignificant weightage .
this was even more true of organic chemicals , which grew at the rate of nearly 6.7 per cent per year .
heavy electrical equipment developed at the rate of 7.9 per cent , but this industry also occupied a relatively low position in the industrial structure .
cycles and motorcycles continued to grow at a fast growth rate of 8.8 per cent but they too had a small weightage .
electricity was the only exception which with a substantial weight , grew at a fairly rapid rate of 7.6 per cent .
the iron and steel industry with a weight slightly exceeding 7 per cent had a growth rate of 4.2 per cent per year .
other industries in the group also had a set - back .
petroleum refining , cotton spinning , cables and wires , railway locomotives , continued to have low growth in both the plans .
it did not capture the dynamism or dimensions of new industries like chemicals , petro - chemicals , garments , gem cutting and electronics .
at the same time , it continued to attach the same weight to traditional industries like cotton textiles in the mill sector , though their relative importance had declined .
as a result , the existing series underestimated the true growth of the industrial sector .
from time immemorial our rishis and poets have admired the wealth and beauty of the vegetation that lends enchantment to the indian landscape .
we could neither raise a single crop or fruit nor make our clothing .
they were fully winged creatures , but flew rather clumsily .
the adult palaeodyctiopteran was a short - lived aerial creature , which enjoyed not more than a few hours of sunshine and air .
compared to insects , man , who came , perhaps a quarter of a million years ago , is a very young upstart .
where do they occur ?
there is indeed not a single square centimetre on the earth ' s surface where one or another kind of insect is not found .
if electricity were to be taken to unprofitable areas like villages , there was an obvious need for a scheme of subsidies and special incentives .
thus considerable thinking was needed , if an appropriate institutional , legal and fiscal framework for rapid and sound power development were to be evolved .
needs in the meanwhile were increasing , thus making the country ' s dependence on imports greater .
the female lays her eggs in water and dies soon afterward .
the adult stonefly does not feed ; all the feeding having already been done curing the prolonged childhood .
most of them , especially the crickets , can produce sound ( the familiar chirping noise ) and have tympanum ( ear ) to receive the sound .
extremely slow moving insects , not easily noticed in the bush ; they never rush about a feign death at the slightest disturbance .
the parthenogenesis if often geographical ; bisexual in one area and only females in another area !
the entire anatomy of the insect body is moulded for this single activity flight .
perhaps the earliest animals on the earth which can fly the insects have the simplest and the most efficient flight mechanism in the world .
as a flying machine , the body of an insect is far more perfect than most man - made aeroplanes or even birds for that matter .
the wings are their organs of flight , but the whole body is intricately involved in flight .
the insect wing is essentially the expanded side lobes of the skeletal plates of the thorax .
they are generally longer than wide , narrow at the tip and are attached to the body by a narrow base .
the front margin of the wing is nearly straight and hind margin is rounded , in conformity with aerodynamic principles .
as a result of these complicated , but truly swift movements , the tip of the wings appears to describe a series of loops .
in the movements of the wings are combined the actions of an efficient airfoil , propeller , steering , rudder and brake , all in one .
the insect in flight literally hangs in mid air !
the wing of the male of the small fly forcipomyia beats 988 - 1041 times a second .
there are , however , no beggars !
unfortunately it is only too true that the worst enemies of insects are insects themselves !
nearly every species of insect is hunted and devoured by some other species .
the dominant hunters are predators belonging to the orders plecoptera , odonata , mantodea , certain hym - enoptera , coleoptera like carabidae , certain heteroptera and diptera .
the hunting technique of different species varies according to the nature and size of the prey and local conditions .
nearly all the predatory insects strike with lightning speed .
their compound eyes are exceptionally well developed and often occupy the whole visible surface of the head .
they can easily perceive even slight movements in the field of their vision .
while a prey remains fairly safe from attack as long as it remains motionless , yet its slightest movement instantly seals its fate .
active pursuit of prey : active pursuit of prey by an insect hunter must be on the ground or in the air .
dragonflies are perhaps the most powerful winged hunters .
the antlion larva , true to its name , is a terror for ants , on which it feeds exclusively all the year round and throughout its life .
the wily antlion takes mean advantage of the habits of ants .
you need not of course worry about how your ' friend ' feels about you .
a number of insects do just this and they have actually refined this art !
the insect society is extremely complex and highly organized .
the inequality is also on a much higher level than in man .
human society is not a single family and there is nothing therefore so binding on its individuals as in an insect society .
we will read about this further on .
the individuals belonging to the different castes are readily recognized by the pronounced differences in their size and shape of their head , sense organs and capacities .
the queen termite and the king belong to the reproductive castes .
the queen termite is an enormous , elongate , fat wormlike creature , often as long as 10 cm .
the reproductive forms are winged and the males and females swarm in great numbers at dusk , usually after the first downpour of the monsoons .
in nature honeybees build their combs on branches of trees , in the hollow of tree trunks or from overhanging rock .
all ants are social and no solitary species exists .
no ant can survive alone by itself far away from its colony .
the social life of the ant is far more complicated than that of bees or termites and presents many unsolved problems for the naturalist .
the size and polymorphism of the ant colony are extremely variable ; polymorphism indeed attains its maximum development and complexity among ants .
there are as many as twenty - one different castes in the colony of a single ant species .
insect musicians insects produce various kinds of sounds .
humming and buzzing , with which we are so familiar , are actually passive events of wing beats in flying .
the pitch of some insect sounds is often as high as 3668 - 4138 .
crickets are perhaps the most familiar of a stridulating insect .
who has not heard their cheerful chirping in the kitchen or the pantry ?
this is the case with the honeybee and gall - wasps cynips .
in the aphids reproduction is often extremely a complex affair .
from a fertilized egg develops a wingless female that reproduces parthenogenetically for several generations , the numerous progeny being wingless females .
then appear both females and males , again by parthenogenetic reproduction .
these females and males now migrate to another food plant , mate there and the mated females deposit fertilized eggs .
among certain diptera , in addition to the sexually developed female ; adult , the immature larva is capable of reproducing parthenogenetically .
in the viviparous insects , the eggs hatch within the mother ' s body and the larvae or pupae or even the young adult are born .
there is in some viviparous insects a well developed uterus , from which the young insect derives its nourishment during its uterine development .
the brood nests protect both eggs and larvae .
sometimes even a small store of the larval food is laid by the female .
the sexton beetle ( staphylinidae ) digs tunnels in sand on sea beaches , strewn with sea - weed and other organic debris .
the female beetle lives at the bottom of the tunnel and cuts out oval chambers all around her retreat for the eggs .
she uses the main gallery as a shelter for larvae that hatch .
certain solitary bees establish their brood nests in mud - cliffs .
india had ample deposits of low - grade coal and suffered from a grave shortage of natural oil .
an expert committee recommended , in 1954 , the setting up of a plant to produce 300,000 tons of oil at a cost of rs 55 crores .
but it was found that technology was fast changing and that new factors had to be taken into account .
these mechanical and electrical industries were individually small , and did not even collectively add much to the industrial structure .
some species of osmia and another bee deuterogenia show a partiality for old snail shells as places for establishing the brood nest .
nest - building by digging ; crickets , many beetles and other insects dig their brood nests .
after disposing of this debris sufficiently far from the entrance , she turns round and round , so as to give the tunnel a circular section .
she stamps and smoothens the walls and packs everything in expertly .
when finally the tunnel appears to be satisfactory , she proceeds to lay eggs .
you have to watch her at work to realize how serious and purposeful she is , wasting no moment and taking no rest till her work is completed .
the female wasp brings pellets of moist clay from over a distance of a kilometre .
cantao ocellata and tectacoris are two common indian bugs that brood over their eggs , completely hiding them from all prying eyes .
they leave only after - the young ones have all hatched from the eggs and scattered for feeding .
the solicitude of the mother extends even to the newly hatched larvae .
the mother does not go even for her own food .
she does not also distinguish between her own larvae and those of other females , but guards and looks after everyone that happens to come to her .
many insect mothers go to the extent of always carrying their precious eggs with them .
even among the cockroaches this peculiar maternal solicitude is known .
a remarkable south indian aquatic cockroach is viviparous and gives birth to a number of young cockroaches .
an allied development after the war was the commencement of manufacture of power - driven pumps .
the output rose from 14,333 pumps in 1949 to 47,989 in 1951 .
the country had no capacity to manufacture agricultural tractors of which the imports averaged rs 4 to 5 crores a year .
non - ferrous metals are as vital to a wide range of modern industries as iron and steel to the entire economy .
fortunately , india , which is otherwise poor in its non - ferrous metal ore deposits , has some rich deposits of bauxite .
its reserves are estimated at 250 million tons , high - grade ores being estimated at 25 to 28 million tons .
precis is a small , but beautiful butterfly , blue , yellow , tawny or brown and with vivid eye - spots .
fond of open country and sunshine they are strongly attracted by showy flowers .
vanessa cardui is the most common species and is widely distributed in asia and europe , up to the arctic circle and occurs also in north africa .
this is a pinkish - red beauty , with black markings .
it remains concealed inside a nest of silken webbing and folded leaf blade .
the butterfly is well known for its migrations .
the indian red - admiral butterfly vanessa indica occurs on the hills of south india , the himalaya and north burma .
though eminently a butterfly of the forest , it is fairly common even in open areas .
they are generally bright tawny , with transverse lines of black spots above and silvery spots below and stripes underneath .
argynnis hyperbius occurs in sri lanka , south india , the himalaya and north burma .
satyrids the satyrids are generally dull brown with characteristic eye - spots on the wings .
their caterpillars are green , brown , pink or yellow , and feed generally on grass .
the adults flutter rather jerkily , close to the ground and cannot be said to be conspicuous as flower visitors .
they are generally attracted to toddy , rotting fruits and other fermenting objects .
mycalesis , lethe , maniola , erebia and melanitis are the common satyrid butterflies of india .
lastly , to call a housefly monumentally stupid sets the seal on our own ignorance .
it does not have to go to a university to learn how to do all these things .
how does it do it ?
is it a halfroll or an inside loop in mid air ?
if you are an aeroplane pilot , try to figure it out ; it is still an unsolved mystery .
its safety depends wholly on its alertness , its acuteness of vision , its ability to be off like streak of lightning .
a housefly cannot eat solid food like a grasshopper , it cannot bite and it cannot also suck liquids like a bug or like a butterfly .
we have heard many incredible stories about the marvellous capacity of the wily bedbug .
the habits and life - histories of the two are more or less similar .
the male dies soon afterward and the female seeks the water to deposit her eggs and then she also dies .
at its tip it is toothed and sharply hooked .
this modified lower jaw is called as ' fangmask and serves as a trap for capturing the prey .
the fangmask is then shot out forward with lightning - like speed and the victim is caught between the teeth and hooks .
retracting the mask , with the victim impaled in the hooks , the larva eats its meal at leisure .
the larva breathes by means of gills , which also serve as tails and as rudders in locomotion .
generally however it sucks the blood of fish , tadpole or frog .
aquatic beetles the dythcids and hydrophilids are our important aquatic beetles .
production increased from 11,375 tons in 1950 - 51 to 36,000 tons in 1955 - 56 .
there was only one ddt factory , the public - sector hindustan insecticides , with an annual capacity of 700 tons .
among the major bottlenecks in the expansion of the chemicals industry were the shortage of sulphur and the absence of chemicals machinery industry in the country .
imports met all our needs before the war .
imports during 1953 - 55 averaged 133,000 tons per year .
the first ammonium sulphate production was begun in mysore in 1938 .
this plant had , however , only a small capacity of 6,600 tons per year .
it was followed by fertilisers and chemicals travancore ltd . ( fact ) in 1949 with a capacity of 50,000 tons .
fact had to its credit the distinction of evolving a process for the manufacture of ammonia from locally available wood .
the steep step - up in production from 47,304 tons in 1950 to 340,222 tons in 1954 was due to sindri .
the demand was , however , estimated at 500,000 tons of nitrogenous fertilisers .
but the importance of such a project took time to dawn on the authorities .
construction started in 1946 , but a number of difficulties intervened , such as a legal dispute over land acquisition and delay in the supply of construction materials .
the food of the high altitude insects is thus literally air - lifted from the plains .
the snow fields and glaciers are regular feeding ground for these insects .
it is here that they hunt other insects and spiders that come to eat the air - lifted food .
the insect life at high elevations is also remarkable for the pronounced predominance of wingless and flightless forms .
in the cold world of incessant wind , flight is not only difficult , but also unnecessary .
they are only of academic interest to the few to whom we refer as nature lovers .
even the specialists in the agricultural , forest and veterinary departments have not seen them nor do they know much about them .
these insects lead their lonely lives , quitely contributing to the general balance in nature and die unsung without leaving a trace .
where are they to be found ?
often they are enemies of other insects , which are useful or friendly to man .
the damage caused by insects to agriculture , industry , animal husbandry and public health is not , however , always considerable .
the moth is thus killed even before it has had time to attack the crop .
the effect of the release of parasites in the field lasts for some time before it becomes necessary again to make a second release .
both conservation and introduction are strictly in the nature of external interference and disturbance of the stability of an ecosystem .
into which all other animals fitted themselves .
if man starved occasionally in india , the fault was not of the insects .
manavendranath or m . n , roy was not the original name of the person whose life is being sketched here .
it was assumed years later when he desired to close one chapter of his life and open a new one .
the original name was narendranath bhattacharya and it is by that name that he was known during the first phase of his life , the phase of militant nationalism ,
his father , dinabandhu bhattacharya , was the head - priest of the temple of goddess ksheputeshwari in the village ksheput in midnapur district of south - west bengal .
the head - priestship was hereditary in the family .
dinabandhu left the village and took a job as a sanskrit teacher in the village of arbelia .
later dinabandhu shifted to chingripota , a village in the same district about 12 miles south of calcutta .
narendranath was brought up and educated at chingripota which also became the scene of his first action as a militant nationalist .
little precise information is available about the school that he attended and the progress that he made there .
it appears , however , that he passed the entrance examination and enlisted himself as a student in the national college in calcutta .
they formed together a group which has played a big role in the social and political development of modern bengal .
siva - nath sastri , a great scholar of the nineteenth century , tore off his brahmanic sacred thread , to adopt the new religion , brahmoism .
here narendrariath came in contact with hart kumar chakravarty who became his life - long friend and close associate in all his social and political activities throughout his life .
in his early years , narendranath must have absorbed a good deal of sanskrit learning from his father , elder brother and others .
table 7.7 summarises the progress of production of sugar between 1939 and 1956 .
to understand this unsteady nature of the industry , it is essential to remember that sugar production was crucially linked with that of gur .
most of the cane was grown on small , uneconomic plots of land .
cooperative farming had not made much headway except in up .
the bulk of the cultivation was confined to up and bihar where the yield was poor .
there had been no significant improvement in productivity since the thirties .
the national average at 14.7 tons per acre was far too low in comparison with 62 tons in hawaii and 56 tons in java .
funds were raised through a number of political dacoities committed under naren ' s supervision .
this dacoity , which has come to be known as the garden reach political dacoity , created a sensation in calcutta .
this was the first major dacoity and the whole operation was completed within a few minutes at gun - point without having to fire a shot .
naren was arrested a day or two later for his part in the dacoity .
another revolutionary ' action ' which took place a few months earlier also deserves notice .
' martin ' then urged that the ship should be diverted to bengal .
the cargo was said to consist of 30,000 rifles with 400 rounds of ammunition each and 2 lakhs of rupees .
he made many friendships .
the most fruitful amongst them was the friendship with evelyn trent .
the collaboration continued until they separated in 1926 .
in new york , roy came in contact with many american socialists and other progressives .
roy began in new york a systematic study of socialism .
but he soon discovered that he had become a convert to socialism .
in the beginning roy did not accept the materialist philosophy of socialism .
he had done it several times in india .
he decided to resort to it again .
he had a letter of introduction to the governor of that state .
he decided to run away to mexico .
the border was several hundred miles away but it was not very closely watched .
he gave a slip to the police in new york and after a two - day train journey landed in mexico .
in the meanwhile , when borodin returned to moscow , he was charged with misappropriation of the crown jewels .
later they worked together in moscow and china .
in spite of differences on political issues from time to time , the friendship continued throughout roy ' s association with the comintern .
borodin completed roy ' s conversion to communism .
roy also roy introduced borodin to president carranza and other important people in the government .
borodin impressed them and with roy ' s efforts succeeded in securing many facilities for the work of the russian government and the comintern .
thus thanks to roy ' s position in mexico , the bolsheviks secured a foothold in the new world .
borodin accomplished the mission that was entrusted to him which , he knew , could not have been accomplished but for roy ' s assistance .
he had made many friends and he knew that they would be unhappy at his decision to go away .
evelyn roy , who was with him in mexico , accompanied him to moscow .
the existing machinery did not make it possible to recover the maximum sugar from sugarcane .
prices continued to rule high , affording no relief to the consumer even during periods of glut .
but the controlled prices , though lower than free market prices , were bound to be quite high for the consumer in view of the high cost of production .
he had by that time become a convinced ardent communist and had accepted moscow as the directing centre of the world revolution to which he had pledged his life .
it was arranged that delegates to the second congress of the comintern ( communist international ) should gather in berlin and would be then transported to russia .
accordingly , roy reached berlin towards the end of december 1919 .
the attendance from socialist groups in europe was meagre .
roy saw from his hotel window the army coming in as well as marching out .
it was a demonstration to him of the power of the working class .
the social democratic party of germany was the best organised of the socialist parties of europe .
it had the powerful backing of a strong and well - knit trade union movement .
they believed in inevitable but gradual progress towards socialism and disapproved violent activities and armed insurrection .
in power , they tried to steer the country in the direction of socialism .
a keen debate among all these forces , on the theoretical as well as the practical plane , was taking place in germany during roy ' s stay .
roy was elected to the national and colonial commission , the most important amongst them .
the discussion over lenin ' s thesis on the national and colonial question took place mainly in the national and colonial commission .
but lenin was kind and understanding .
he amazed roy by suggesting that he , roy , should write an alternative thesis .
after some persuasion . roy agreed to write a supplementary thesis .
lenin ' s as the main and roy ' s as the supplementary thesis . the congress adopted them in the same form on the recommendation of the commission .
the controversy between leriin and roy centred around the type of assistance to be extended by communist parties in colonial countries to the nationalist bourgeoisie and their organisations .
" our old idea of revolution put the cart before the horse .
it attached decisive importance to arms , and when the opportunity of getting them appeared to present itself , we believed that revolution was round the corner .
we did not stop to consider the problem of recruiting men to carry arms .
a few weeks after the second congress , roy was in tashkent1 to begin his work of spreading the revolution to the east .
it was a vast area inhabited by the most backward people .
enemies of the revolution , particularly british imperialism , were inciting them to create troubles for the new republic .
the incitement was based mainly on the non - muslim and non - religious character of the bolsheviks .
roy used to keep himself well informed of the happenings in the country during the year and make necessary changes in the manifestos .
roy never regarded the congress as the political party of the bourgeoisie .
that was the constant refrain of all his writings about the congress .
some communist emissaries like nalini gupta , abani mukherjee , shaukat usmani and charles ashleigh had also visited india .
but the groups were small and had no contact with one another .
they were looking for a dynamic programme .
roy ' s programme of mass action on the basis of workers ' and peasants ' struggles for their immediate economic demands attracted them .
they were also attracted by the goals of communism .
an opportunity came by but was not seized .
in the meanwhile the government was watching closely the activities of the communists in india and of roy and his associates in europe .
it decided to launch a conspiracy case and started arresting those who , it knew , were active in the communist movement .
the first to be arrested was shaukat usmani , then followed muzafifar ahmad and nalini gupta .
there were two other accused : roy and sharma .
roy was in europe and sharma in pondicherry beyond the jurisdiction of british - indian courts .
he had to pay the price for his part in the conspiracy when he returned to india in 1931 .
comintern and the correspondence between the accused and roy were cited as proof of the conspiracy .
the court held the offence proved and sentenced the accused to four years '
roy was not happy at the type of defence that the accused had put forward .
it was a legalistic , technical and apologetic defence .
it took some time for roy to devise new channels of communication and continue his work of encouraging and guiding the activity .
that the setback was temporary was proved by the conference that was held in kanpur in december 1925 to establish a communist party .
roy welcomed the event as a fulfilment of a dream that he had entertained for long .
in 1925 , there was a change in the agency for directing communist activities in india .
the work was entrusted to cpgb ( communist party of great britain ) .
roy ' s old friend , borodin , was then in china .
he was there since 1923 .
he was the chief adviser to the ccp ( chinese communist party ) and also to the nationalist government .
he had with him a number of russian advisers including general galen alias blucher .
borodin did not like the new comintern line .
he had on that issue serious differences with roy and gave him no assistance in implementing it .
he controlled the purse - strings and had the confidence and support of the leader of the ccp , chen tu - hsiu .
the conference was held eventually in hankow towards the end of may .
there were two nationalist governments , the leftist in hankow and the rightist in nanking under the leadership of chiang kai - shek .
these differences were debated in the fifth congress of the ccp held in hankow for two weeks from 27 april onwards .
roy put forward his point of view which was in sharp contrast with that of borodin and chen tu - hsiu .
on all issues the congress supported roy and the decisions were on the lines suggested by him .
he was happy at this outcome .
he found that the decisions were not being implemented and that different interpretations were being placed on the decisions that were taken .
roy was helpless as all effective power was in the hands of borodin and chen tu - hsiu .
again the government remained inactive .
they collected the peasants and over twenty thousand of them surrounded changsha .
however , when they were at the gate of the city , the communist headquarters in wuhan ordered them to disperse and go back .
the situation was grim but not hopeless , according to roy .
he was in favour of a determined offensive .
i demanded a plenary meeting of the central committee to be attended by local leaders .
the demand was opposed on the plea that important members of the party could not leave their respective posts in those critical days .
the top leaders were against the plenary session , because local workers were impatient for decisive action and would have surely endorsed my plan .
as a last resort , i sought to act with the co - operation of individual comrades , chinese as well as russian .
many other russian comrades had also come around to my view by that time . but all power was centred in the hands of borodin .
moscow had backed me up politically as against his opportunism .
nevertheless , in other respects , he was still left in the controlling position , and consequently functioned as the dictator of the communist - party .
wang ching - wei had suspicions about the communists that they would support tang sheng - chi , a powerful militarist , and not him .
there he was promised full support of the soviet government as well as of the communist international . . .
i managed to send a radio message to moscow demanding the reassurance .
several people have criticised roy for showing the moscow telegram to wang ching - wei .
but that was at the worst an indiscretion .
nothing turned on it ; the leaders of the left kuomintang had already decided their course of action .
with the failure of his mission in china began roy ' s downfall in the comintern hierarchy .
two years later it ended in his final break with the organisation .
differences in the comintern were a reflection of differences in the cpsu ( communist party of soviet union ) .
differences in the cpsu assumed serious proportions after lenin ' s death in january 1924 .
in germany , the group led by brandler and thalheimar , roy ' s friends , was thrown out for the same reason .
the following year he was expelled from the ecci and the politbureau of the cpsu .
comintern authorities were expecting a recantation or at least silence .
but roy neither recanted nor remained silent .
he also joined other dissidents in germany and the usa and began exerting pressure for the rectification of the line adopted by sixth congress .
he wrote strong articles criticising the line in the journal of the brandler group .
some of the units were , however , of uneconomic size .
raw material costs were rather high and alternative sources had to be found .
there was satisfactory progress made after the war in the manufacture of cement machinery .
they had already captured the home market and further expansion on any significant scale was ruled out .
however , there were good reasons for modest optimism in view of the anticipated difficulties of imports and the emergence of war demand .
this was the first time that he was getting the chance of joining the congress and working within it .
thereafter roy attended the faizpur session of the congress held in december 1936 .
at the session roy spoke in the subjects committee on the constituent assembly .
it was an eloquent appeal to reason .
he outlined a concrete programme of action for involving the large masses in the national struggle by identifying it with the people ' s struggles for their immediate demands .
the speech had a profound effect upon the audience .
left - wing intellectuals who were present in a good number were thrilled by it .
they felt that roy had opened before them what they were seeking , the road to revolution .
the meeting was cordial , but the conversation that took place disclosed to both the gulf that separated them .
the elections were to the new provincial legislative assemblies which were to come into existence according to the government of india act , 1935 .
the congress was pledged to wreck the reforms , but had decided to contest the elections rather than boycott them .
roy participated in the election campaign in maharashtra and karnataka .
in april 1937 roy began the publication of his weeky journal independent india .
the journal enabled him to express his views from week to week on all national and international developments in a clear and forthright manner .
production , however , varied considerably as can be seen from the following figures :
imports of all kinds of cotton manufactures had been reduced to negligible proportions even before the war .
exports received a spurt during the war in spite of various difficulties .
the roy group which had grown up became more active after roy ' s release .
its membership increased and it became a powerful factor in the political and the trade union field .
about this time ellen gottschalk to whom roy had regularly sent his letters from jail came to india .
she came with the intention of giving permanent companionship to roy .
in january 1938 he went to bengal .
that was his first visit to the province of his birth after a lapse of over twenty years .
he was welcomed as a hero and his speeches wherever he went were heard with rapt attention .
by this time roy had made a home for himself in dehra dun .
it was at 13 , mohini road .
it consisted of an old , deserted bungalow with a big compound with tall trees but overgrown with shrubs .
in a short while the shrubs were removed and a lovely garden was developed in the compound .
the place became the permanent residence of the roys , to which they returned after their regular annual tours .
the place was away from the city and gave roy the quiet that he desired .
before beginning his work in the congress , roy clarified through a statement the line that he proposed to follow .
if it is the latter , then it must adopt the plan of action and the organisational form of a communist party .
for years it kept hovering between the two alternatives until years later it was forced out of the congress .
it did not like the growth of roy ' s influence in the congress .
roy had also declared that , after the change of line effected by the seventh congress , he had no differences with the comintern .
consequently , roy did not get any help from the cp group in his work in the congress .
prominent amongst them were fascism , historical role of islam , our problems and letters to the csp .
clouds of war were hanging over the horizon for several years .
many , including roy , had observed them and warned the people against the threat of war .
the clouds burst suddenly in september 1939 and the world found itself in the throes of a war .
the war that broke out was not the war that roy and many others had predicted .
they had predicted an imperialist war of nazi germany against soviet russia with the help and co - operation of imperialist england and france .
it was an unexpected kind of war and it was not easy to recognise its social character and significance .
to leftists in the country , to the csp , the cp and the forward bloc , it was clearly an imperialist war as england was involved in it .
he did not succeed and that brought to an end his association with the congress .
roy had a hard job convincing his associates as well .
by then the war had reached what has been called the phoney state which might have resulted in a stalemate .
but early in april 1940 hitler began his blitzkrieg and by the end of june conquered practically the whole of western europe .
all free institutions in those countries were suppressed and puppet regimes established in order to use their resources for winning the war .
england alone remained in the field and freedom and democracy all over the world appeared to be nearing their end .
he realised that the war had now become a people ' s anti - fascist war and all energies must now be devoted to ensure its success .
the rise of fascism in germany delayed the revolution for at least a generation .
the suggestion was turned down as inappropriate .
in both cases , the association ended because roy insisted on thinking for himself and following the path which he considered right .
after the break with the congress , the league of radical congressmen was converted into the radical democratic party ( rdp ) .
but that did not deter him ; he pursued his path of duty unmindful of the abuse that was showered on him .
the following two quotations from roy ' s writings in the early period of the war will give an idea of the intensity of his feeling .
just think for a moment : what is going to happen , if fascism is victorious ?
therefore , we do not want fascism to be victorious .
if we really want fascism to be destroyed , why should we not do anything and everything to bring about its destruction ? "
on another occasion he wrote : the fight against fascism must be the immediate object of all fighters for freedom and democracy .
any policy which will not accept this as the point of departure will be wrong .
fascism is the instrument forged to bolster up a system which has decayed throughout the world .
a free india will then take her rightful place in a world of free men engaged in the task of building a higher civilisation .
no other national leader except nehru shared that concern .
nehru was , therefore , unhappy at the turn the national movement was taking , but he could not break away from it .
roy was more free to strike out his own path .
roy was deeply pained by the prospect of europe relapsing into barbarism as a result of the triumph of fascism .
narrow - minded nationalists carry on a campaign of abuse against us because they do not understand the issues involved , nor can they appreciate the values at stake .
on the other hand , the government is suspicious because we are avowed revolutionaries .
but the courage of conviction and a clear vision of the goal will enable us to steer through the dangerous waters between scylla and charybdis . "
during those days there were from time to time rumours about roy ' s inclusion in the viceroy ' s executive council .
that enabled him to carry on his work a little more freely and vigorously .
that did not bring about any change in the congress attitude towards the war .
early in 1942 the war reached india .
it came to be known as the people ' s plan in contradistinction to the bombay plan prepared about the same time by a group of industrialists .
the people ' s plan was , therefore , followed in a few months by the draft of a constitution of free india .
it came to be known as the draft constitution .
it is based on the eighteen principles accepted by the rdp at its inaugural conference and popularised by it since then .
it was prepared by roy and released for public discussion in december 1944 .
he was denied independence as well as sovereignty .
that happened also under capitalism and that , according to roy , was the basic cause of the crisis that had afflicted the world .
neither capitalism nor communism showed the way out of the crisis .
roy had seen through long experience in europe the defects of parliamentary democracy in the political field and of laissez - faire in the economic field .
the remedies advocated by communism , dictatorship of the proletariat and central planning , were equally defective .
but it was necessary to give both organised democracy and co - operative economy a philosophical foundation .
everything that man has done , every one of his acts , cultural progress , scientific achievements , artistic creation everything has been motivated by that one urge .
therefore , the urge for freedom is the only eternal thing in the human world .
according to it , man is the creature of nature , he is an integral part of the physical universe .
" therefore , man ' s being , and becoming , his emotions , will , ideas are also predetermined .
therefore , man is essentially rational .
man is moral because he is rational .
in 1946 , the rdp decided to contest elections to the provincial assemblies .
roy had to play a major role in guiding and organising the election campaign .
serious talks and disscussions about transfer of power began in that year .
roy was anxious that power should be transferred to the people and not to political parties claiming to represent them .
he did not succeed in persuading the british government to see his point of view nor did he succeed in building up the necessary organisation of the people .
but even then he could not completely breakaway from politics .
from time to time , political issues cropped up and he had to state his position on them .
his articles won high recognition at home and abroad .
internal availability as a result increased beyond the absorption capacity of the market .
the government did not seem to have a well - thought - out policy to deal with the problems of scarcity , soaring prices or the subsequent slump .
the policy , if any , could only be described as one of control , decontrol and recontrol .
the total dismantling of the controls was done in 1948 , much against the views and advice of experts and economists .
the result could only be described as disastrous .
this policy of decontrol was largely responsible for the post - war inflation .
price controls were , therefore , hastily re - imposed and stocks frozen .
the industry , however , made runaway profits during the government ' s four - month honeymoon with decontrol .
he could not continue his speech and closed the meeting after paying a short tribute .
in this period roy wrote and published a number of books .
the most important amongst them is his two - volume book , reason , romanticism and revolution .
the first volume was published in february 1953 and the second a year later after his death .
the first english edition of roy ' s book on china , revolution and counterrevolution in china , was published in 1946 .
it was written in 1930 but had remained unpublished for many reasons .
they were collected together and published in book form in 1964 under the title m . n . roy ' s memoirs .
a number of political books were also published during those years .
this initial explanation given above refers to the ideal aspect of culture .
after the preliminary discussion , it is comparatively easy for us to give a definition of culture .
in order to make the idea clearer we will try to distinguish it from two allied conceptsreligion and civilisation .
religion in its wider sense coincides with , and goes beyond , culture and in its narrower sense , forms an important part of it .
the general idea of a nation is a group of men living under the same political order in the same state .
but it is not an adequate definition .
if different groups of people are living in the same state by a historical accident or under compulsion we are not justified in calling them a nation .
this definition covers the two essential conditions of nationhood .
all other characteristics which we can observe in the existing nations are preconditions paving the way for the formation of a nation .
in most cases , these additional factors automatically develop by political association over a long period .
so it seems that nature designed this entire region to be a perfect illustration of the geographical , term ' country ' .
they are the preconditions of nationhood , but the essential condition which actually constitutes it is the general will of a people to be a nation .
in the economic field they find it is made difficult for them to get into public or private services or business ;
but cultural intolerance is so widespread and so strongly rooted that few of our leaders have the inclination or the courage to raise their voice against it .
then , in order to restore the balance , emphasis had to be laid on the purely materialistic side of reality .
these characteristics of the indian mind have also considerably influenced the moral values of the people .
in this respect the contrast between the indian mind and the modern western mind stands out clearly .
its normal relationship to nature is not , therefore , one of struggle but of harmony .
we have seen that , on the whole , in most parts of the country , there is a certain regularity and moderation in the changes of the weather .
barring the amount of rainfall which may differ considerably from year to year , the climatic conditions are fairly steady .
every season begins at fixed times and its intensity varies within fixed limits .
thus from the point of view of political organisation also we find the same idea of unity in diversity dominating the indian mind .
these are a few examples to illustrate the characteristics of the indian mind and the temperament produced by its special physical and economic environment .
the other important element is the ideational , i . e . ideas , beliefs , principles which have their own origin in the consciousness of the higher values .
different cultures , belonging to varied types of geographical environments , may accept it in full or in part , according to their special needs and circumstances .
the progress of the textile machinery industry was more impressively reflected in the weaving section .
the older system of lighting was replaced by fluorescent lighting .
embroidery and garment making were two of the post - war additions to the field of operations of the industry .
this was the first of the four research institutes proposed , the other three being earmarked for bombay , baroda and coimbatore .
labour deployment was much better in the new mills erected after the war and was improved in some , of the old units .
the 1940s saw some major transfers of ownership from non - indian to indian hands .
the managing agency system was almost universal before the war , but there was now a great change in the pattern of control of the industry .
the figures shown on the seals provide ample evidence that they worshipped shakti or the mother - goddess and sacrificed goats and other animals to her .
there is no doubt that the hindus inherited both these practices from them .
in one of these he is shown with three faces wearing a horned head - dress which was replaced later by hindus with a trisula or trident .
among animals the bull , the buffalo , the tiger and the elephant were possibly regarded as sacred .
in hindu mythology the bull became the vehicle ( vahana ) of shiva .
the use of the swastika and wheel as the symbols of the sun also dates from that period .
opinions differ about the origin of the builders of this civilisation .
but most scholars agree that they belonged to the old austric race with a mixture of the races coming from the mediterranean coast .
houses were built of mud .
the art of making bronze utensils and weapons had made great progress .
spinning , weaving , dyeing , and the carpenter ' s and goldsmith ' s trade were also common .
singing and dancing were commonly practised but the most popular pastime was gambling .
however , the aryans had not reached any significant level of material civilisation and had not yet learnt to build cities .
but their religious consciousness was of a higher order than that of other ancient peoples .
they neither built temples nor worshipped images .
before coming to india their objects of worship were natural phenomena .
no intellectual conception is possible .
the son asks the father to explain to him the real nature of brahma .
then he asks the son to think of a subject possessing these attributes .
the son first of all thinks of matter but finds that it cannot account satisfactorily for the existence of the vegetable and the animal kingdoms .
this is the highest conception of reality for the philosopher but it cannot satisfy the mystic because even pure reason involves the duality of subject and object .
the taittriya upanishad takes the son further on in the search for the unity of reality and identifies brahma with ananda or the state of bliss .
the perfection of self requires self - restraint and temperance keeping carnal desires under the control of reason .
the first step to the realisation of truth is to practise self - denial and self - sacrifice instead of self - indulgence .
according to the upanishads there are four stages in life through which the seeker after truth has to pass .
about 49 per cent of the looms were more than forty years old , and about 75 per cent more than twenty - five years old .
taking all types of machinery together , 90 per cent of it was more than twenty - five years old .
it was , therefore , no surprise that the industry ' s cost of production was high , quality poor and productivity of operatives low .
to put the industry in shape , a massive modernisation programme was called for .
all the machinery installed before 1910 needed to be urgently replaced .
government assistance , which was under consideration , could meet only part of the requirements .
ninety others were making a nominal profit .
another ticklish problem waiting to be solved was about the co - ordination of the mill sector and the handloom sector .
the world rayon industry was as old as the 20th century , but its indian counterpart was a post - war phenomenon .
the requirements of filament yarn were estimated at 70 to 75 million lb , all of which was imported till 1950 .
these were based on imported raw materials , which comprised dissolving pulp , cotton linters , rayon - grade caustic soda and sulphur .
woollen manufacturing did not gain significantly in proportion , even though new industries were springing up and the old ones expanding .
the spurt in its expansion came first in 1919 - 20 and again after the second world war during 1948 - 50 .
as in the case of the cotton textile industry , the woollen mills had their counterpart in the decentralised sector .
the industry consumed 15 - 16 million ib of indigenous raw wool and produced mainly rough products .
the fine carpets were the exception and they earned foreign exchange to the tune of rs 4 to 5 crores a year .
among industries , jute was the most severely affected by the depression .
but the outbreak of the war brought about a buoyancy in its production and profits .
its prosperity , so vitally linked up with revival of foreign demand , could be seen to be reflected in growing exports .
the korean war boom doubled export earnings almost overnight in 1951 - 52 to rs 269.73 crores , an all - time high .
government was aware of the urgent need to achieve the former objective , but there were still many unsolved problems in the way .
minimum support prices to the farmer posed a ticklish problem .
prices were tending to be depressed because of an increase in inferior jute output which mills were unwilling to lift .
that was , however , only part of the problem .
price fixation must have a basis in cost of production , of which little was known .
the difference between the two sets of prices was collected as ' surcharge ' and vested in the equalisation fund .
tisco and scob , represented to the government for a higher retention price in view of the rising costs of production .
the board recommended , in 1949 , separate retention prices for tisco and scob in view of their varying cost structures .
but there is a logical transition from trade to manufacture , the merchant - manufacturers acting as agents of such change .
the achievement was short of the target by nearly 30 million tonnes .
there was a shortfall of about 18 million tonnes in the sixth plan .
retrospectively , even this proved an over - estimate .
demand for coal turned sluggish once again during the middle of the fifth plan period .
there was accumulation of stocks at the pitheads to the extent of 14.6 million tonnes by the end of 1976 - 77 .
coal production received a set - back on account of power shortage , labour unrest and shortage of explosives .
the resulting coal shortage severely affected industrial production .
the pattern of coal consumption has undergone a significant change over the years .
on the other hand , coal consumption by the steel industry and power sectors has increased .
now , it has become extremely important to conserve these limited resources and make the best use of the coal that is produced .
in view of the ambitious targets set in the second plan for steel , power and railways , coal development on a substantial scale was felt necessary .
it was thought that an intensified coal production programme was possible only through expansion of public sector collieries .
demand , however , slowed down following the recession of 1966 and the gap between supply and needs was narrowed .
however , serious shortages soon cropped up and have become chronic since .
regional shortages have been sought to be corrected by establishing inter - state grids .
regional electricity boards have come into existence to promote integration of power systems at the regional level .
construction of inter - state and interregional lines has also made progress .
but the development of transmission and distribution systems has not kept pace with expansion of generation facilities in some of the regions .
over the years , the sources of electric power have undergone a significant change .
but then followed a period of technical collaboration with the soviet union which proved crucial in dramatically transforming the oil scene in the country .
but once again , the prospect of discovery of new reserves receded .
however , it was only during the fifth plan that the offshore exploration of ongc met with success with discovery of oil in bombay high .
a gasfield of substantial size was also found at south bassein in the same area .
efficiency of existing assets was low as the bulk of them was obsolete .
the plan estimated the terminal year ( 1989 - 90 ) originating traffic at 340 million tonnes .
but the choice in other respects is not always very clear .
cost - benefit studies not only of a given mode of transport but of the alternatives available are obviously needed .
the integrated long - term transport model of the planning commission , as already mentioned , may be expected to fill this void .
in fact , the potential of inland water transport is yet to be adequately explored , while that of coastal shipping is still to be exploited .
the recommendations of ctpc regarding the creation of a co - ordination machinery at the centre and in the states has not made much headway .
nor have the subsequent five - year plans shown much awareness of the problem .
the committee submitted its report on the eve of the , sixth five - year plan .
the main thrust of the sixth plan programme was to provide for expansion of capacities to meet specialised requirements of components and materials .
another area of emphasis was technological upgradation and standardisation of components and equipment .
major policy changes were initiated , starting from 1980 to ensure the achievement of the plan objectives .
licencing and import policies were liberalised .
the output was equally shared by black and white tvs and colour tvs .
the electricity ( supply ) act , 1948 , came to be formulated with these objectives in view .
modelled on the uk electricity supply act , 1946 , it was in conformity with the modern trend in utility legislation .
thus there was an inadequate appreciation of the necessity for speedy action in a vital sector .
the order diplogossata , ectoparasitic on the gambian rat , does not occur in india .
their physical activity and powers of endurance and flight are truly astonishing .
indeed they are always found doing something or the other .
the bird achieves its lift by moving forward , but the insect does not have to do so .
some insects flutter lazily , but others dash with lightning - like speed .
food of insect and how they feed the food and feeding habits of insects are no less interesting than their flight .
these are , therefore ; known as termitophilous ( termite - loving ) or as myrmecophilous ( ant - loving ) insects .
the parasite has no separate existence apart from its host .
although parasitic insects attack nearly every group of animals , it is an irony that other insects are their most common hosts .
the insects which are parasitic on other insects are called ento - mophagous parasites .
other parasitic insecta hyperparasite or a parasite on a parasite .
the insect society is basically a society of women , run by women for women , one in which the male is a nonentity .
the female does all the work and the male is ignored and is an ignoble dummy .
inequality of capacity , performance , preference , status , reward and opportunity is the most outstanding feature of insect societies .
most insects toil ceaselessly to earn their living compared to a few who live in comparative luxury and idleness .
there is a rigid caste system , which is based on the work undertaken and from which an escape is out of question .
the labours of ex - ploited toilers contribute to the common good of the whole communitythe products of labour belong not to the toiling individual but to the community .
though rigidly caste - ridden and founded on fundamental inequality , it is a kind of socialism into which royalty is even accom - modated .
the privileges of the insect royalty are cer - tainly in no danger of being abolished by coups in the socialistic insect society .
most insects lead solitary lives , but some are decidedly gregarious and live in crowds .
we have the familiar swarming caterpillar or the locust swarms .
social life is not simply a crowd of individuals living together , sharing the same food and occupying the same habitat .
it is this division of labour and mutual interdependence which defines a social insect and marks it off from the ordinary crowds .
the real social insects are termites ( socalled white - ants ) , wasps , bees and ants .
the males soon perish and are in any case eaten off by ants , lizards , etc .
each female soon grows enormously into the queen termite and lays over millions of eggs .
the sterile females or the worker termite hatch from these eggs and take on the various tasks in the colony .
the workers are themselves often differentiated into major and minor workers , with even transitional forms .
they gather pollen and nectar from flowers .
their tongues are elongated and modified to reach down to the nectary .
the next year , domestic bauxite was used .
the indian aluminum company , alwaye , which had the distinction of pioneering the industry , drew its bauxite from the bihar mines .
another plant , the aluminium corporation of india , came into existence after the war .
this too had its mines in bihar , while the plant was located at jaykaynagar near asansol .
production was based mainly on imported alumina up to 1940 , after which local bauxite was used .
besides , some of the raw materials like cryolite and aluminium fluoride had also to be imported .
the adult beetles feed on flower petals , especially yellow ones , and on pollen or on grass spikes , including rice and millet .
the eggs are laid in a mass in soil .
the newly hatched triungulin larva wanders about in search of the eggs of grasshoppers or of ground - nesting bees .
once inside , its first act is to suck the eggs of the bee or the grasshopper dry .
it now feeds on the honey stored by the bee and pupates and emerges as the adult blister beetle .
there are several species of blister beetles in our country .
it visits yellow flowers by pref - erence and feeds on petals and pollen grains .
mylabris phalerata is about half the size of the other and has very similar habits .
there are blue coloured blister beetle epicauta actaea , metallic - green epicauta tenuicollis and a somewhat larger brown gnathospatha rouxi .
they feed on pollen grains , petals , tender ears of paddy , millets and other grasses .
when disturbed , all blister - beetles exude from the joints of their legs an oily yellow or orange liquid droplet .
this liquid causes painful blisters on human skin .
the pow - der of dried blister - beetles is used in the extraction of cantharidine for the manufacture of medicines and hair oils .
the weevils or snout - beetles of which there are many thousands of species , have heads produced prominently in front into a beak .
the most common butterfly in india is danaus chrysippus , popularly called the plain - tiger .
it occurs also in south africa and throughout india , nepal , burma and other neighbouring countries .
it is usually some shade of orange - brown , with black markings , enclosing white spots on the wings .
the caterpillar is grey coloured , with five black and yellow bands on each body segment , in addition to a yellow stripe .
danaus umniace is another common butterfly of the plains , with black wings , marked with bluish - white streaks .
the green pupa has golden spots in front and a serrate metallic coloured band behind .
other important danaids are euploea , which are mostly black or very dark brown to blackish - brown butterflies , with white spots and streaks .
the caterpillars of pieris breed on the leaves of cabbage mustard and other cruciferae , sometimes also capparidaceae .
pieris brassicae is the well known white cabbage butterfly .
the caterpil - lars of the yellow - coloured colias breed on leaves of leguminosae .
ixias pyrene are yellow and black and occur in sri lanka , south india , bengal , the himalaya and burma .
eurema hecabe is a small beautiful yellow coloured butterfly , with black edges on the upper side of the wings .
they visit flowers , though some settle on damp ground , dung , toddy or rotting fruits .
charaxes and eriboea are the fastest - flying butterflies .
all nymphalids love to bask in the sun on trees and bushes .
their caterpillars feed on leaves of a great variety of plants .
these butterflies are abundant in the northeast and are truly denizens of dense humid forests .
they are not generally flower visitors , but are strongly attracted towards manure and overripe or rotting fruits .
erioboea schreiberi is the blue nawab of the western ghats , assam and burma .
heavy chemicals constitute raw materials and process agents for a large number of consumer goods , whereas ' fine ' chemicals are consumed directly .
the supply of sulphur was , therefore , the limiting factor in the production , of its derivatives like sulphuric acid .
imports of sulphur amounted to 55,326 tons in 1950 and to 73,941 tons in 1953 .
soda ash is another important chemical used in large quantities by the glass , soap , ceramics , paper , rubber , textile , etc . industries .
raw materials required by the industry like coal , coke , limestone , ammonia were all available internally .
requiring a large investment soda ash was not developed before the war .
they succeed in doing this by utilizing the forces of surface tension of water .
as a rule , the surface dwellers inhabit stagnant waters and the divers inhabit both stagnant and running waters .
it is very much similar to the desert locust in general appearance , but is somewhat more reddish coloured .
we also find insects that do not occur in the plains , but which are confined exclusively to the mountains .
they are the mountain autochthonous insects , viz . those which evolved on the mountains .
this grouping is of course artificial and wholly unscientific , though a necessary fiction of convenience .
it is not always possible for us to label an insect as completely injurious or as completely useful .
we must not also forget that this grouping is based on an infinitesimally small fraction of the insect life of india .
there is , however , no serious harm in examining it here , as long as we do not forget that it is pure fiction ! .
it is totally a matter of complete indifference whether these insects live or die .
they seek out the most vulnerable stages of the harmful insects , far better than any cultivator can hope to do .
the major parasitic insects belong to hymenoptera and diptera .
the hymenopterous parasites are mainly ichneumonids , braconids , evaniids , chalcidoids , proctotrypoids , etc .
among the diptera the most important entomophagous parasites are tachinids .
no less than five thousand entomophagous parasites are so far known from india , there being many more still to be discovered .
nearly every one of them is beneficial to man .
we cannot hope to give here even a sketchy account of their habits .
we may refer to some by way of examples .
very often over 70 % of the grasshopper eggs in a locality may be found parasitized .
the caterpillars which feed on leaves of crop plants are heavily parasitized by braconids like apanteles , and chalcidoides like brachymeria .
after this , he offered himself as a whole - timer for the cause of liberty of india from the foreign yoke .
in 1905 , naren used to attend anti - partition meetings held frequently in calcutta along with his two friends , hart kumar chakravarty and saileswar bose .
once the three friends invited the celebrated nationalist leader , surendranath banerjea , to kodalia and arranged a meeting for him .
in a short while , it developed an inner or underground wing which became the centre of revolutionary activities all over bengal .
in course of time , similar organisations were set up in many other towns , some as branches and others as independent centres .
about this time the international situation had become tense .
towards the end of 1913 , naren began efforts to make contact with the germans through the german consulates - general in calcutta .
the war between england and germany began in august 1914 .
the revolutionaries then redoubled their efforts to take advantage of the situation .
he is chas a . martin , who despite his name is hindu and high - caste brahmin .
communism offered in those days the most promising way to the goal of socialism .
the case involved about a hundred americans , germans and indians .
roy was arrested one evening on the campus of the columbia university where he had gone after attending a meeting addressed by lajpat ral .
roy left the court with the determination not to go there again .
he wrote later in the memoirs : " to court imprisonment had not yet become a revolutionary virtue . for good reasons , too .
clustering of factories in up and bihar and shortage of cane in these areas usually resulted in cut - throat competition and uneconomic prices .
but a year of acute shortage pushed cane prices higher and was followed by a year of over - production of cane and idle capacity in the industry .
there were sixteen factories lying idle in 1956 .
the cost of production of indian sugar was high and , for exports , the quality was low .
about two - thirds of the cost of production was accounted for by the price of cane , which was beyond the industry ' s control .
use of bagasse for paper manufacture involved considerable deployment of funds which were hard to come by .
the technical efficiency of indian mills was low as compared with that of their counterparts in other countries .
both talked to him about the organisation of revolutionary work in the east , including india .
as a result indian the second congress of the comintern met in moscow from 23 july to 7 august 1920 .
the congress opened with a ceremonial inauguration in leningrad where all delegates were taken in special trains .
roy and his wife , evelyn roy , attended the congress officially as the representatives of the communist party ; of mexico .
india was represented by two others , abani mukherjee and m . p . b . t . acharya .
the first plenary session elected a number of commissions .
he , wanted to write about the decline and fall of british imperialism .
a good amount of material was collected and kept for safe custody with a publisher in berlin .
it fell prey to the vandalism of hitler .
roy also wanted to write a social history of the indian people dating from pre - vedic times to the modern age .
he had some original ideas about the aryans and the characteristics of the hindu civilisation .
it is a pity that preoccupation with politics did not allow him to write the books that he desired to write .
it changed its name from time to time to escape the police net .
even in europe , roy was not free from police attention .
once he was thrown out of germany and had to seek refuge in france .
england , of course , was out of bounds for him as warrants issued against him for his old revolutionary activities were still in force .
manifestos and open letters were also issued by him from time to time .
roy ' s manifestos to the indian national congress began with its session in ahmedabad held in december 1921 .
they were sent to the gaya , gauhati , kakinada and belgaum sessions of the congress .
more important amongst them was the manifesto to the gaya session over which c . r . das presided .
roy also held the same view .
entry into kuomintang paid rich dividends to communists in the form of wide support amongst workers and peasants .
on the basis of that support , they were able to win many important positions in mass organisations , in the government and the army .
complications arose , however , in 1926 .
the com - mander - in - chief of the nationalist army , chiang kai - shek , was opposed to the communists .
he organised a coup against them in march 1926 in canton and another in april 27 in shanghai .
eventually , the kuomintang split into two factions : the right and the left .
communists supported left kuomintang , but discovered later that there was little difference between the two .
it insisted , however , on continuing the alliance with the left kuomintang .
roy and his delegation reached canton in february 1927 .
the nationalist government had by then shifted to hankow , one of the three neighbouring cities collectively known as wuhan .
he had to go there , but was held up in canton for three weeks .
the journey took five weeks and it was april by the time that they reached hankow .
by the time roy reached canton , differences between the right wing of the kuomintang and its left wing supported by communists had reached serious proportions .
the debate went on for some days with moscow giving evasive and contradictory directives .
there was the revolt of hsia tao - you . who marched on the capital to overthrow the government .
he was defeated and turned back through the spontaneous resistance of the people , but the government took no action against him .
a fortnight later , a more serious revolt took place at changsha .
general hsu ke - hsiang and the officers under him staged a coup .
the story of the cement industry during the war and after was one of steady expansion .
the progress of the industry since 1939 is shown below :
in spite of this phenomenal growth , per capital consumption of cement in india remained the lowest in the world .
it increased from about 7 ib in the pre - war years to about 11 ib in 1944 and impressively to 30 ib in 1956 .
but even then it compared poorly with 500 to 6,000 ib in the western countries .
the industry was in the happy position of having an expanding market , a satisfactory supply of raw materials and a reasonably efficient organisation .
it had the distinction of having financed its growth through its own reserves .
to improve the situation . roy launched a movement for trade unity .
the attempt did not succeed immediately but in the unity that took place later , the programme played an important part .
that happened in calcutta at the annual session held in july 1931 .
communists then walked out and formed a new organisation called the red trade union congress .
equally exaggerated were his ideas about the militancy and consciousness of workers .
i find it appropriate to add that socialism or communism which means the same thing is not the issue of the day .
both accepted the individual as the central point of all social thought and action .
both stood for decentralisation of political and economic power , and both suggested party - less democracy for purifying politics .
there were , of course , some fundamental differences .
roy was a materialist and rationalist ; while gandhi was a spiritualist and , relied more on his inner voice ' .
that did not , however , come in the way of working together for some practical ends .
common work of that type developed in later years between the radical humanists and the sarvodaya followers of gandhijl .
roy ' s own ideas about gandhiji also underwent a big change in the last couple of years of the latter ' s life .
he realised that gandhiji was a big moral force .
it reached him when he was speaking in a meeting in calcutta .
students of india ' s cultural history know that thought has always had a high place in the scale of values in india .
such thinking is more religious than philosophical .
let us not misunderstand the import of what has been said above .
now a well - knit monarchical state had taken the place of the primitive tribal democracy .
circles of noble - men had formed round the court and monopolised all the more lucrative administrative posts .
the religious ceremony of the coronation and other ceremonies and sacrifices had been introduced .
of these the most famous was the ashvamedh or horse sacrifice .
it was performed by a raja whom the rulers of a considerable part of the country had acknowledged as their overlord .
the raja who aspired to be an emperor would let a horse , dedicated to the gods , loose to roam about the country .
they had tamed the elephant and used him for riding as well as for the transport of goods .
the coastal trade was reserved in 1950 for indian vessels in response to a long - standing public demand .
by the end of 1952 , almost all ( 96 per cent ) of the trade was carried in indian ships .
india ' s overseas trade was , however , largely carried in foreign vessels .
this involved a huge drain on our precious foreign exchange .
moreover , increasing coastal and inland water transport services would have relieved the railways of considerable strain .
to meet mainly the latter objective , the government provided funds for ship building at visakhapatnam .
the share of railways was expected to increase further with rise in diesel prices .
the policy of liberally granting national permits to truck operators does not seem to square with the approach recommended by the committee .
one of the most important recommendations of the committee was regarding the machinery for transport co - ordination .
there has hardly been any follow - up on these recommendations .
sickness among the mills has been growing since the 1970s .
the national textile corporation ( ntc ) has in its charge 120 mills with an installed capacity of 4.1 million spindles and 56,000 looms .
the corporation has been incurring sizable losses year after year .
but the prices of man - made fibres have been artificially jacked up and the government is yet to take a firm view on the subject .
traditionally , the jute manufacturing industry has been next in importance only to the cotton textile industry in the national economy .
though it has lost this pride of place lately , it continues to be a major exporting industry .
besides , there are 40 lakh farmers engaged in jute cultivation .
as we have seen in an earlier chapter , the industry has had a particularly fickle fortune .
it declined to 40 per cent in 1976 - 77 .
as a percentage of our total export trade , jute goods exports registered a steady decline .
the industry has not been able to hold its ground in exports in terms of either value or volume .
but even the export of this item is facing diminishing prospects .
the main threat to jute exports has come from synthetics .
emergence of plastic and paper materials as substitutes and growing use of container transmission have jeopardised the future of traditional packing material like jute .
jute carpet backing has been losing ground to primary backing polypropelene backing .
the subsidy scheme had to be revived as the prices of ships being built in india continued to be higher than prices abroad .
frequent changes in ship designs both delayed the deliveries and increased the costs .
it was disheartening to the yard struggling to find its feet .
therefore , the government had no alternative but to expand capacity speedily to make the industry competitive .
up to the middle of the fifties , the development of indian shipping and shipbuilding industries had been limited ; they needed considerable acceleration .
india ' s oil imports averaged 3 million tons , but it did not own a single tanker .
as a result , there were frequent delays and avoidable hardships and congestion at the few major ports .
the equipment at the ports had been overworked during the war and had become obsolete .
the setting up of two oil refineries at bombay called for extra port facilities .
the capacity , therefore , left for normal traffic was further declining .
india was among the early starters in air transport .
for increased production steps were contemplated for better capacity utilisation .
even so this meant nearly an additional 4 million tonnes of finished steel per year over the output level of 4.89 million in 1973 - 74 .
happily , the fifth plan witnessed progressively improved performance on the part of the integrated steel plants .
power shortage and consequential coal shortage had affected production in 1973 - 74 .
but for the railway strike in may 1974 and shortage of power from dvc , production would have been higher .
it also represented capacity utilisation of nearly 84 per cent .
the production target for 1984 - 85 was 11.5 million tonnes .
however , as observed above , the actual production was only 8.2 million tonnes .
the actual consumption in 1984 - 85 was 10.9 million tonnesa good 2 million tonnes less than the plan estimate .
the seventh plan period was considered to be the stabilisation phase for the steel industry .
the accent was on modernisation , increased productivity and speedy implementation of the ongoing projects .
mecon ' s entry into non - ferrous metallurgy was marked by their appointment as engineers and consultants for the korba smelter complex of bharat aluminium .
mention must also be made of m / s m . n . dastur &amp; company , the oldest consultancy agency in the country .
iron and steel technology changes very fast .
it is , therefore , of great importance that adequate efforts for research and development are continuously made so that technological progress is possible .
keeping this in view , the government created the research and development organisation under hsl at ranchi .
this organisation has succeeded in making considerable technical progress in many directions .
of these , 100 were reported to have gone into production .
soon they were up against many odds , such as shortage of power and scrap , and above all , fall in demand .
the factors favouring mini steel plants are low investment , shorter gestation and regional dispersal .
however , the bureau of industrial costs and prices found that production of mild steel by electric arc furnaces was a costly process .
such furnaces were , therefore , used in industrialised countries mainly for the production of alloy and special steels .
the government also thought that the problems of mini steel plants needed deeper study before their future development could be determined .
so a cautious approach to their future growth was adopted .
the increasing adoption of the continuous casting process by the integrated steel plants would mean that they will themselves use most of the scrap generated by them .
by varying the proportions of the alloying elements , the special characteristics of special steel can be altered .
the production of special steel is strategic not only for their critical industrial uses but also for defence needs .
there are , however , few plants exclusively manufacturing special steel .
however , in view of the financial difficulties , not much progress could be made .
the plant went into commercial production in march 1982 .
a modern blanking facility was added in 1993 to produce coin blanks and utility blanks .
however , the realised capacity and production were 8.65 lakh tonnes and 8.0 lakh tonnes respectively .
the seventh plan set a capacity target of 12.62 lakh tonnes and a production target of 9.80 lakh tonnes for 1989 - 90 .
in fact , the mineral base of the country can enable us to be self - sufficient only in aluminium and to some extent in copper .
the country has large bauxite deposits necessary for a substantial aluminium manufacturing capacity .
as a result , sizable imports had to be made .
during the sixties , imports accounted for about 30 per cent of the supply .
however , demand declined during the early seventies and imports also fell in sympathy .
there was once again a spurt in demand during 1975 - 80 but increased domestic availability reduced the need for imports .
the two major components of demand for aluminium are ec or electric grade and cg or commercial grade .
at the same time , the demand for other uses could not be met due to inadequate supply .
ec grade demand constituted over 50 per cent of the total during the sixties .
the seventh plan estimated the demand for aluminium in 1989 - 90 at 4.5 lakh tonnes .
there was , however , a steady improvement in production after 1946 .
in the post - war years production increased rapidly .
they improved considerably after 1937 and but for the exception of the war years , continued to be substantial during the early post - war years .
but once again in 1948 - 49 they were back at the pre - war level of 1.3 million tons .
but under the stimulus provided by the korean war , they soared to 2.8 million tons in 1951 - 52 .
the bhabha committee report ( 1966 ) is an important landmark in the development of the industry in the country .
even the most optimistic estimate of the bhabha committee regarding future demand and production was proved naively low in a couple of years .
in the latter half of the sixties , the output of electronics grew at an average annual rate exceeding 25 per cent .
the bhabha committee estimated the need for the decade , 1965 - 75 , at rs 1,650 crores or an average of rs 165 crores per annum .
the committee assumed that the production of entertainment equipment like radio receivers , tv sets and tape recorders would double between 1965 and 1970 .
this made way for the ' transistor revolution ' in the country .
with the development of the consumer - grade components industry , the direct import content for radio sets was brought down to zero .
the production of computer systems increased substantially and exceeded the plan target , but the base was still small .
the value of output of electronics trebled during 1980 - 85 .
even so , the fact remains that the growth rate of the industry was high , exceeding 30 per cent per annum .
certain qualitative achievements must also be noted .
bharat electronics started the production of electronic components and devices required in micro - wave communication .
bhel commenced the manufacture of industrial electronic control equipment .
how long they would last depended on what steps were taken for their conservation by way of stowing , washing and blending .
use of oil and electricity in place of coal by the railways was a gradual process .
a beginning was made when the yp locomotives , designed to burn non - coking coal , were put on the indian railways .
a beginning was also made in the regulation of the use of coal when the mines and minerals regulation act ( 1948 ) was put on the statute book .
the objective of the board ' s action was to reduce gradually the output of coking coal .
there were proposals for washing and blending coals .
the rate of growth of this industry was 3.44 per cent per year .
considering the continuing scarcity of this commodity and the demand for it projected from plan to plan , this cannot be considered as an adequate growth rate .
the railway equipment , which remained depressed in the past , fared no better in later years .
the heavy vehicles industry too grew very slowly .
it may be noted that both railway equipment and heavy vehicles have significant weightage in the index of industrial production .
petroleum products , which registered an impressive growth rate during the sixties fared poorly in the seventies with an annual growth rate of only 4.9 per cent .
vanaspati as well as sugar and tea , which are important mass consumption items , also performed badly .
thus , it is clear that the growth record of the industrial sector in the seventies was patchy .
during the next ten years , it almost trebled and by the end of 1950 , it had gone up fivefold to 1,712,515 kw .
the position did not change during the next ten years .
in 1953 , only 1.5 per cent of the total estimated hydro - electric potential of 35 million kw had been exploited .
in view of the limited resources of oil and coal , vigorous exploitation of hydel power assumed great urgency .
from very early years , public authorities have owned a substantial part of the public electric supply industry .
this was as it should be , considering the public utility nature of this industry .
but in 1979 there was a decline , once again because of the widespread drought during the year .
the growth rate of this sector was low at 2.2 per cent per year during 1970 - 79 .
this compared poorly with the growth rate of 5.2 per cent for metal - based industries and 6.9 per cent for chemical - based industries .
the agro - based industries have almost the same weight as the latter two put together .
it is easy to see the link between performance of the agricultural sector and the growth of the agro - based industries .
it is obvious that though the industrial structure changed over the years , its dependence on agriculture and allied sectors was still substantial .
the period 1950 - 80 marked the first phase of industrialisation which came to an end with the exhaustion of the import substitution possibilities and the limited domestic market .
this , however , would be possible only if our industry became globally competitive and efficient .
this process had begun in the late seventies though it gained momentum in the early eighties .
towards this end , it advocated recognition of higher capacities arising out of technological improvements and labour productivity .
in the course of the sixth plan period , more significant and far - reaching policy initiatives followed .
the public sector must become much more dynamic and competitive .
this change in the role of the public sector would call for much greater management autonomy , closing down of inefficient units and radical restructuring of the rest .
the plan advocated further liberalisation of industrial regulations keeping in view the need of productivity , scale economies and efficiency .
the complementarities of the sectors must be kept in mind so that their growth could be harmonised and optimised .
his very descent , from the arboreal prehominid stock , is traced back to an ancient insectivorean ancestor that ate insects !
it is the inconceivably varied and rich insect life that is continually replenishing the natural resources on the earth , perhaps faster than man exhausts them .
truly insects are the prime architects of our landscape and the partners in our agriculture , industry and culture .
do not insects destroy our crops , spoil our stored products and transmit fatal diseases of man and domestic animals ?
sure they do , but for that man himself is primarily responsible .
by interfering with natural ecosystems , man has unwittingly forced some insects to turn injurious to him .
otherwise , the lives of most other insects would run as smoothly as ever before .
the composition of the air would drastically change , the resulting chain - reaction would eventually extinguish the flame of life on earth .
we know them all because many of them literally live most intimately with us .
centuries before the latin name hexapoda ( six - legged ) was coined in europe .
insects also differ from these creatures in having a distinct head , a thorax and an abdomen .
the six legs are confined to the thorax .
in most insects the thorax bears one or two pairs of wings .
the insects were indeed the first animals on the earth which really flew , millions of years before even birds .
the armour plates constitute the body skeleton , which lies superficially on the body and at the same time is not heavy and bony like ours .
as a result , there was a great increase in the world consumption of petroleum products .
world production increased from 293 million metric tons in 1940 to 631 million tons in 1955 .
as against this , the indian production remained static for decades .
this was a disheartening fact , considering the great industrial potentialities of petroleum products .
the use of oil as a source of energy was only one of its many uses .
but , unfortunately , india ' s oil production was limited and the reserves had not been explored .
only the digboi refinery with a capacity of 425,000 tons was based on indigenous crude .
ultimately , the railway administration aimed at bringing it down to a mere fifty .
the average annual production during 1948 - 49 to 1951 - 52 , however , was only 2,000 wagons .
but it was not adequate to meet the railways ' needs .
the railway workshops had been the largest producers in the past .
the public sector hindustan aircraft ltd . and some private firms entered the field in later years .
switching from the production of war needs to peace - time civilian demand involved many difficulties .
standardisation was lacking .
neither the industry nor the government was aware of the great strides countries like japan and germany were making in these lines .
fiscal protection was given and extended from time to time in most of the cases and restrictions on imports were imposed .
the robber - bee coelioxys smuggles her eggs into the brood nest of the leaf - cutting bee megachile .
another bee stelis does the same thing in the nest of the bee anthidium .
it leaves the spot when the other insect goes out and quickly drops its eggs into the ready - made and already provisioned nest .
ouflaging their eggs ! what surprising skill and resource - fulness do they show in the construction of their brood nest !
it is perfectly aware of the situation and proceeds about the job in a most purposeful way .
here is a most interesting situation : if the wasp enters through one of the doors , the spider is likely to escape by the other emergency exit .
the wasp has now three courses open .
firstly , it can break one door and when the spider comes out for repairing it , catch it .
thirdly it can rap first one door and then the other until the spider becomes confused and runs out .
the grasshoppers , most appropriately named , are happy at home among green grass and other low vegetation .
in an emergency , a grasshopper can also fly .
most grasshoppers are incurable gluttons and often completely denude whole bushes of leaves in a very short time .
in our country grasshoppers are most abundant during the monsoon rains , but are not wholly absent at other times .
the mynah snaps up grasshoppers by dozens in no time from a bush , in which you see none .
they lay a cluster of eggs , in small pockets , often at depths of several centimetres , underground .
the development of the eggs is rather slow and may take a whole winter or the dry summer season .
unlike their short - horned cousins , these are mostly nocturnal in their movements , remaining concealed during the daytime .
many of them are vegetarians , but others predacious .
during the monsoon rains , they are generally attracted to light at night . they produce a shrill and harsh sound .
mecopoda and holochlora are two of our common long - horned grasshoppers .
the former has a curious dark brown dead - leaf colour and occurs on trees .
sarthrophyllia is a flattened bark - like creature , which rests motionless and flat against the bark of tree trunks during the daytime .
the crickets the crickets or gryllids are great chirpers and expert burrowers , though some of them live on the surface of the ground .
the crickets are rightly famed for the loud and sustained shrill notes produced by rapidly rubbing a rough area of the right wing over one of the left side .
the note is sometimes so shrill that it is beyond the range of sound perception of the human ear ( supersonic note ) .
the word cricket is really a corruption of crickle , an imitation of their crickling noise .
brachytrepes achatinus is a large brown cricket that often comes above ground when its burrows are flooded by overnight rain during the monsoon .
sometime , attracted by strong white light at night , they may crawl above ground and unlike other crickets , they never jump .
they have no ' jaws ' as such , no teeth to bite and chew hard and solid food .
inside it there are four delicate , long sharply pointed needle - like stylets .
there are two kinds of bugs : the socalled true bugs or heteroptera and the cicadas , aphids , mealybugs , etc or the homoptera .
the wings develop gradually and become evident as stumps , at two or three moults before attaining the adult stage .
some free - living and most parasitic bugs have lost their wings .
though most bugs are slow in their movements , some can run vigorously and others can also jump like a grasshopper .
one or two bugs have even invaded the sea .
coptosoma are hard - bodied bugs that look curiously like beetles .
some of them are coloured bright orange , green , brown or black or even metallic - green , blue and coppery - red .
a large shield or scutellum extends over their whole back and often conceals their wings .
chrysocoris is a most beautiful , large and brilliant metallic - green or metallic - blue bug , commonly found on jatropha plants .
leptocorixa usually feeds on grass , but , seems to prefer paddy , to which it causes severe damage by drain of sap .
the pyrrhocorid bug dysdercus is a fairly common , conspicuous red and black - spotted bug , causing much damage to the cotton crop .
they capture small prey and suck their blood .
their adult life is but a few weeks long .
they depend on trees for food ; when young they suck at roots and as adults on tree trunks and branches .
the female can hear , but cannot answer , as she is incapable of producing sound .
cicadas are rare in the plains , but abundant on the hills and on the himalaya .
our commonest cicada is platypleura .
the cicindelids are the socalled tiger - beetles , because they are great hunters on the ground .
they have long and sprawling legs , which enable them to run swiftly even on sandy ground and have bulging eyes , with keen vision .
their larvae live in vertical pits in soil and develop slowly for a year or so .
cidndela princeps is a velvety - black beetle , with yellow kidney - shaped spots at the sides and a broad yellow band in the middle .
it is a bright red coloured beetle with seven conspicuous black spots of variable shape and size .
this is also a predator on aphids ; a single beetle in captivity consumed nearly two hundred aphids a day .
on the leaves of the brinjal plant we find another somewhat larger ladybird epilachna , a dull reddish - brown beetle , with black spots .
e . duodecistigma , the twelve - spotted epilachna and the other e . vigintoctopunctata , with twenty - eight small spots .
the young yellow larvae scrape off the soft tissues of the leaf as food ; these two ladybirds are often injurious to potato and cucurbits .
lampyridae or the familiar glow - worms and fireflies are also beetles ; the flow - worm is the wingless worm - like adult female or the larvae .
the jaykaynagar plant had , on the other hand , the disadvantage of high cost of thermal power .
the indian copper corporation started production of copper in 1928 .
two years later , a hot - rolling mill was set up for the production of brass sheets ; the cold - rolling mill followed much later in 1950 .
this remained the only plant of its kind till after the war when its capacity was 7,200 tons .
at the same time , imports averaged 30,000 tons .
the saturnids are wild silkmoths , brightly coloured and of immense size , often attaining a wing span of 25 cm in the famous atlas moths .
they are all typical denizens of dense forests , particularly humid tropical forests .
a curious feature among these moths is that in the forest a female moth attracts great crowds of males from a considerable distance , probably by scent .
the atlas moth is the largest of the indian moths .
the tussar silkmoth is not domesticated ; the silk is obtained from its cocoon collected from wild plants in the forest .
insect life in our homes is entirely a creation of man himself .
it is an artificial life for the insect , whose original home is out - of - doors .
the nearest relatives of all our household insects , including the highly specialized synanthropous species like the bedbug , live entirely out - of - doors even today .
their adventure has not been a blessing either to them or to man .
the case is , however , different in the cities .
it is necessary to emphasize , therefore , that only a few species , if at all , have specialized for exclusive life in the village homes .
there is a popular belief , particularly among our fashionable city folk that the houseflies are dirty creatures .
believe it or not , the housefly is one of the cleanest creatures on the earth .
it is almost an obsession with the housefly to keep its body clean !
here is harmony and rhythm of shape , size colour and movement ; music of geometry !
it is in this way that flies spread the pathogens of cholera , typhoid and dysentery .
it seems ironical that though trying eternally to keep its body clean , the housefly should continually contaminate human food ; for this man himself is partly responsible .
he creates the unsanitary conditions that " favour the fly to carry the contaminating matter .
other species include musca nebula , the most common housefly of india and musca vicina , a smaller fly frequenting our homes .
the housefly has numerous enemies like lizards , birds , etc .
it suffers high mortality from epidemic diseases caused by fungal parasites .
it is attacked by parasitic mites and nematode worms .
the bug sucks up the mixture of blood and saliva .
the bedbug has not been positively known to transmit any human disease ; it may develop into a vector of disease germ in future .
it is also curious that the bedbug does not seem to have any natural enemy ; at least no lizard or other insectivorous animal would ever devour it !
the modern insects are mainly terrestrial and air - breathing .
many of them have , however , invaded fresh - waters and , even seas and have successfully colonized diverse aquatic habitats .
they are secondarily aquatic insects that breathe air even when submerged under water .
india is rich in inland watersrivers , streams , ponds , lakes , tanks , springs , etc .
they walk and run with great speed on the water surface .
most surface - haunters are gregarious and show a decided partiality for open waters , particularly some shady tree on the shore .
the water - striders and skaters are true predatory bugs , with well developed wings and are capable of flight occasionally .
they have rather long hairy legs , coated with a water - proof secretion so that they do not break the surface of the water .
an - other surface - bug is gerris , which has the hind legs much longer than the other legs .
these two bugs merrily run about together and skate on the pond surface throughout the hours of sunshine .
perhaps the most interesting of the surface - haunting insects are the whirligig beetles ( gyrinidae ) .
some cases are square in cross - section .
all cases are open in front and closed behind .
caddisworms feed on algae and other aquatic plants or are also carnivorous and feed on other insect larvae .
mosquitoes the familiar mosquitoes are true aquatic insects in their infancy .
although the larvae are aquatic in every sense , it is remarkable that they breathe atmospheric air directly .
the diurnal temperature fluctuations are thus very large .
these tracts are typical semi - deserts and extend imperceptibly into the true deserts of sind , arabia and sahara in the west .
there is a popular misconception that the desert does not support life .
it is , however , the home of numerous complex and specialized animals and plants .
they come out only during the night .
the majority of desert insects are expert diggers and burrowers .
they are also capable of running very fast on the loose and shifting sands , without tumbling down .
the desert lives at night and sleeps during the daytime .
in the hottest part of the year , some desert insects remain in their underground shelters in a torpid state called aestivation , from which they revive in winter .
the problem of water scarcity has been solved by the desert insects in a variety of ways .
many insects live habitually at the edges of oasis and do not stray far from the water .
the insects have the physiological capacity to tap both the small free water and the chemically combined water for its own use .
they can also be closed tightly to prevent the escape of moisture in an emergency .
the typical desert insects are confined exclusively to the semi - arid and arid areas of rajasthan , sind and parts of baluchistan .
their closest relatives occur largely in arabia and parts of africa , especially sudan .
the great majority of the himalayan butterflies arose from an ancestral stock that lived formerly in indo - china , south china , thailand and burma .
the indo - chinese butterfly chilasa is , for example , most abundant in the east himalaya , but extends sparsely even up to kashmir .
chilasa agestor occurs from tonkin to siikkim , chilasa agestor govindra from kumaon to kashmir and chilasa agestor chiragshahi occurs in western kashmir .
papilio protenor is found from formosa , hainan , china , tonkin and burma and extends through the eastern himalaya to kashmir in the west .
thousands of beetles of all types inhabit these forests .
their survival is dependent on the extreme atmospheric cold , snow and ice .
it is the snow and ice which provide them with all their moisture requirements .
some of them die on exposure to the warmth of the human hand .
this is simply not possible , at least in india .
what we very conveniently forget is the fact that , unlike usa , agriculture in india is very ancient .
when man arrived , the insect inhabitants accepted him and readily assimilated him .
this was not desirable for agriculture , nor was it in the interest of a balanced development of the industry .
we would only briefly recount the progress of sugar , cement and paper industries during the forties and the early fifties .
like the two premier and old indian textile industries , viz . cotton and jute , sugar too constituted a significant bridge between agriculture and industry .
but the protective duties were converted into revenue duties of the same amount .
the most prominent amongst the latter was the anushilan samity of dacca .
each samity was under one leader .
rigorous rules of admission , were enforced , strict discipline was maintained and effective steps were taken to preserve the secrecy of operations .
the government and police were all along suspicious about the samitys .
the calcutta anushilan samity was declared illegal in 1908 .
as a matteij of discipline and as a matter of policy , new members of samitys were first required to do social and relief work .
he was a government employee working as a shorthand clerk in the office of the financial secretary to the government of bengal .
he was affectionate by nature and had a very attractive personality .
he gathered around him a large group of young revolutionaries .
naren was already involved with barin ghosh in his bomb - making activity .
the bombs manufactured at the centre were used in a number of places in calcutta .
the one used at muzafferpore by khudiram bose on 30 april 1908 was traced to the centre .
the centres was raided and searched and on the basis of the materials that were found , a conspiracy case was instituted .
it was the alipore conspiracy case in which barin ghosh and aurobindo ghosh were the principal accused .
naren was not involved in the case , though the police had suspicions about him .
he was released on bail and then he absconded .
the netra dacoity was not tried separately .
it was made part of the howrah conspiracy case which was instituted a year later .
living as a fugitive , naren spent most of his time in howrah and sibpur .
it fell to the lot of naren to get together the scattered elements , revive their confidence and reorganise their ranks .
naren ' s chingripota group played a big part in this work .
he also worked as a bill collector of a rice mill and a timber works in beliaghata .
in 1912 - 13 , naren mainly stayed at a boarding house in sreegopal mullick lane .
sometime later , naren gave up his jobs and opened a restaurant which became a centre for procurement of arms and exchange of information .
it was popular amongst soldiers and sailors owing to the special dishes that naren used to cook for them .
young men trained in bengal were sent for ' actions ' in those parts and sometimes the bombs and pistols used also came from bengal .
preparations for armed insurrection required funds .
his fight against the police is enshrined in the annals of the revolutionary movement of bengal as the battle of balasore .
the battle resulting in the death of the commander - in - chief broke the back of the movement .
it was several years before it recovered from that blow and resumed its work .
in the meanwhile , naren was busy in his search for arms .
the german consul complained that the indians lacked organisation and that they were not able to keep secrets .
naren had three or four meetings with the consul but found that he was making no progress .
the germans had no men to send and were unwilling to risk a ship . "
another attempt that was made is described as follows in the memoirs : " i made yet another attempt to bring help overseas from indonesia .
they also carried several guns each .
naren accepted the advice and changed his name to manavendranath .
the surname roy is , however , far different from bhattacharya .
it is not possible to know why the particular name roy , common bengali name , was selected .
m . n . roy was born on the campus of stanford university .
as described by him , " it was the beginning of an existing journey in a new world . "
he could not , however , give up his old mission of securing arms for the revolution in india without a struggle .
in stanford , roy met many academicians and political workers .
when roy reached mexico , general venustiano car - ranza had established his supremacy and become the president of the country .
the civil war had ended but the country was still in a disturbed condition .
the writ of the central government did not run in some parts .
president carranza had proclaimed a new constitution which gave some rights to the people as well as advanced the interests of workers and peasants .
the government was generally popular , but it did not enjoy the support of any organised popular group .
the need of such support became evident when , a few weeks after roy ' s arrival , the country faced the threat of american invasion .
roy was at that time of great help to the government in mobilising the support of the people .
they brought him to the attention of liberal politicians and socialist workers .
there were a few persons in mexico city who called themselves socialists .
but they were more anarchists and syndicalists than socialists .
they did not believe in political action nor in the defence of the country .
in a few months the situation became ripe for launching the socialist party .
an impressive conference was held in mexico city in december 1917 and the socialist party was launched .
the conference elected roy as general secretary of the party .
his work for creating the party was so outstanding that nobody paid any attention to the fact that he was a foreigner .
the party conference adopted a socialist programme and demanded from the government a number of measures for the amelioration of the large masses .
it extended at the same time support to the government in resisting the threatened american invasion .
he had to draft the labour bill and accompany the labour minister to various places to pacify workers who were resorting to strikes .
the activities of the socialist party strengthened and widened the social base of the government .
the president and the government gave roy full credit for this favourable change in the national and international situation .
while roy was thus busy building up the socialist party , a mysterious visitor came to mexico city .
he was michael borodin , one of the leaders of the bolshevik party of russia .
he was on a secret mission to the new world .
on the other hand , to him i proposed a concrete plan of action which should be undertaken to re - establish his effective leadership of the wuhan government .
" it was almost too late when the urgently needed reassurance came .
it is reported that wang showed it to his colleagues who were already in touch with chiang kai - shek .
they decided to act quickly and began their offensive against the communists .
the ultimatum was backed by a thinly - veiled threat to attack wuhan from the north if the suggestion was not accepted .
trade unions and peasant unions were also destroyed .
a reign of terror was established .
borodin left hankow on 27 july .
roy ' s mission to china ended in failure .
but it was the failure not of an individual but of an institution .
the comintern had tried to direct a revolution in a populous and complex country like china , sitting thousands of miles away from the scene of action .
the position was rendered more difficult by the factional quarrels in the comintern between trotsky and stalin .
but he had to work under very adverse conditions .
there were serious differences between him and borodin and the ccp who had the real power in their hands .
first , there was the contest for leadership between trotsky and stalin .
then , there were differences about the policies to be adopted by the soviet union .
the differences can be illustrated by the two rival slogans : ' permanent revolution ' and ' socialism in one country ' .
there were , of course , many fine shades and variations from time to time .
manycommunists who did not believe in that policy were thrown out of the cpsu and the comintern .
by 1928 stalui had not yet smashed his enemies in the party .
in order to vanquish them he thought it necessary to effect a leftward turn .
the political attack against roy began at the sixth comintern congress .
it was launched by kuusenin on the basis of a theory that economist eugene varga had put forward .
the stage was set for the purpose .
i challenge anybody to find . one single passage in them which bears out kuusenin ' s allegation .
then , those journals were published under my editorship as the central organ of the communist propaganda in india from may 1922 to the beginning of 1928 .
( i am not responsible for the first eight months of 1927 when i was away in china ) .
during all that time , i was not once censored for right deviation . "
continuing , roy wrote : " now it is discovered that all the time i have been a social democratic lackey of imperialism .
logically , then , it must be admitted that until the sixth congress , the ci had had a wrong point of view as regards india .
i was not declared at ' renegade and placed outside the pale of the official international , so long as i did not speak out my disagreement .
the gag of silence was imposed upon me , the all - mighty apparatus depriving me of all the means of expression .
in other words , for the unpardonable crime of independent thinking , i would have been quietly buried into oblivion , had i not dared raise my voice .
but the mistaken line pursued in india is but a small part of a huge blunder .
therefore , it is not permissible to keep quiet .
the international is in a crisis which is manifested by the composition and exercise of its leadership . "
the question of roy ' s readmission into the comintern was not considered even after the line was changed as demanded by him .
the other was that he misappropriated large amounts of money .
thereafter even that avenue was closed .
he had then to consider other ways for being of service to the indian revolution .
he accepted the suggestion to go to moscow because moscow was on the way to india .
after the second comintern congress , he welcomed his posting in tashkent because that took him nearer to india .
he pleaded with stalin several times to be allowed to go .
it is reported that stalin agreed to his going after he had completed his mission to china .
but the mission failed . roy lost his influence with stalin and was eventually put outside the pale of the comintern .
roy ' s mind was made up by the middle of 1930 .
by that time he had gathered around him a group of young indians who accepted his point of view and were also personally devoted to him .
roy discussed with his new friends his plan of going to india .
government finances themselves being under great strain , the railways ' ways and means position was unsatisfactory .
in retrospect , it seemed that the railway convention of 1924 had not fulfilled its objectives and needed to be revised .
but in reality , the railway finances were subjected to great uncertainty , so much that during the thirties even the depreciation fund had run down .
a committee of parliament , therefore , was set up in 1949 to overhaul rail finances .
the revised convention , as recommended by the committee , came into effect from 1 april , 1950 .
the contribution to the depreciation fund was fixed at a minimum of rs 15 crores , the actual amount depending on the railway surpluses .
the revised rules of allocation of expenditure between capital and revenue sought to correct the over - capitalisation which was inevitable under the old rules .
when roy returned to india he was a full - fledged communist .
after his return to india and for many years thereafter the worst hostility that roy had to face was from the cpi , the comintern and its adherents .
he was not unprepared for it , but may not have expected that it would be so implacable and virulent .
the ci was not happy with roy ' s return to india .
i shall work for that purpose . "
the statement did not please the right - wing leaders of the congress .
they also knew of roy ' s opposition to gandhism .
roy ' s entry into the congress was not therefore welcome to them .
after the first few weeks they began to look upon him with suspicion .
the csp ( congress socialist party ) was then a growing force in the congress .
it was a curious political phenomenon .
there were serious differences in the leadership even on basic issues .
it called itself a socialist party , but it still believed in many gandhian tactics like boycott of elections and legislatures and offices .
there were also serious differences of opinion on many issues of tactics and strategy .
both the csp and the cp and other leftists were opposed to office - acceptance .
another point of difference was on the organisation of the kisan sabhas ( peasants ' organisations ) .
roy held the view that congress committees in villages should themselves function as kisan sabhas , while the others wanted kisan sabhas to be organised as independent organisations .
the second election of subhas chandra bose as the president against the desire of mahatma gandhi in 1938 created a crisis in the congress .
that prompted roy to get together his adherents in the congress into an organisation .
it held its inaugural conference in poona in june 1938 .
in the beginning it was expected that it would bring together all left groups in the congress .
in 1940 roy contested the election to the presidentship of the congress .
roy attached great importance to his work in the congress . but that was not the only thing which attracted his attention .
he paid attention to the trade union movement as also to the movement of the people of the native states for responsible government .
he delivered many lectures on marxism and communism and social revolution .
the cp was in the same camp until hitler attacked russia in june 1941 .
they all urged the congress to start immediately an anti - war movement .
had the decision been taken earlier , the freedom of many european countries would have been saved . "
he spent the next few months trying to persuade the congress leaders not to adopt a hostile attitude towards the war .
he addressed several meetings and talked to the people about guerrilla warfare and people ' s defence committees .
about this time industrial workers were running away from factories , fearing bombing and enemy reprisals .
it was necessary to keep them at their places of work , so that production might continue unabated through propaganda and other reassuring activities .
the government offered some financial help for this work .
roy accepted on behalf of the federation the help that the government had offered .
it was of the order of rs 13,000 a month .
it continued for about two years .
roy was impervious to all this vile abuse and unjust criticism .
to him , work for the war and for helping war effort was work for the social revolution to which he had dedicated his life .
he expected the same thing to happen in india , if the people co - operated with the war effort consciously and purposefully .
the defeat of fascist powers would , he was convinced , bring about the defeat of fascist elements in each country .
no political scientist could have asked a better confirmation of the prophecies that he had made .
he was engaged in evolving it from 1944 onwards .
in 1946 he wrote the twenty - two theses which outlined it in the form of categorical statements .
the radical democratic party discussed the theses for many months and eventually adopted them at its conference held in bombay in december 1946 .
in 1947 they were elaborated in the form of a manifesto entitled new humanism .
in course of time , the manifesto may attain the same rank in revolutionary literature as the communist manifesto published by karl marx in 1848 .
the basic incentive of organic becoming is the struggle for survival .
it goes on throughout the long process of biological evolution , until in man it becomes the conscious urge for freedom the supreme human value .
the beginning of man ' s endless struggle for freedom lies in the animal struggle for survival .
many disillusioned communists had turned to religion after leaving communism ; many had reverted to liberalism or nationalism .
those ways were open to roy .
but instead of going back , he decided to go forward .
he went beyond communism and discovered radical humanism .
but that required long discussions arid patient arguments .
roy was anxious to retire from politics , settle down in dehra dun and devote himself completety to reading and writing .
but politics did not leave him .
the other is the new way of revolution that roy has suggested .
he discussed it at a study camp held in dehra dun in 1946 .
the discussions at the camp laid the basis for the development of radical humanism .
roy ' s contributions to the discussions are collected together in a book new orientation published by the renaissance publishers of calcutta .
radical humanism brought roy nearer to gandhi and his school of thought .
there were now many similarities between the two .
his friends in europe and the usa were eagerly looking forward to his visit ; .
they were eager to meet him and compare notes about their experiences and reactions to world events .
his illness became more and more serious as days went by .
it claimed him in the end on the night of 25 january 1954 , a little before the beginning of republic day .
roy ' s death was mourned by all , by his friends as well as critics in india and in many other countries .
condolence messages poured into 13 , mohini road .
many meetings were held and many tributes were paid .
the most tedious task in scientific discussion is definition specially of abstract terms .
the fifth and highest mode is that of absolute existence which religion knows as god .
but almost all of them have to make some distinction among the levels of existence named above though they may not recognise them as separate modes .
all agree that one or the other of them is always the end of every moral action and the basis of every moral judgment .
cataclysmic phenomena which disturb the normal routine of the natural process are rare .
no stronger natural accidents than storms and tempests of moderate intensity are experienced by the people .
how has this long observation of regularity and continuity of natural processes influenced the indian mind ?
perhaps the most important effect has been the feeling that the operation of the moral law is just as regular and continuous as that of the law of nature .
his moral conceptions are based entirely on observation of nature .
but this does not mean that the indian mind is incapable of undergoing big changes or that it always takes a very long time over them .
the indian mind is spared such violent jolts because its reaction to new ideas and movements is conscious and gradual .
so agriculture was started here as soon as the crudest implements for tilling the soil were available .
they are more peace - loving and humane .
the cultural history of india , as of other countries , can be divided into three periods : the ancient , the medieval and the modern .
but it is necessary to remember that these three periods in indian history do not correspond to those in the european in point of time .
in the whole universe there was nothing but water .
the dravidian culture in south india and the vedic culture of the aryans in north - west india were in those days two streams flowing apart .
but the time was near when the confluence of the two was to give birth to the first national culture of india .
this destination is the realisation of unity , moksha ( salvation ) .
the full costs of replacement , including improvement and escalation , were to be charged to the depreciation fund .
the convention , which was to be operative for five years , ensured adequate resources for the railways ' post - war development programme .
as we have observed , indian railways had reached the plateau in their expansion even before the first world war .
thus a phase of consolidation had been reached even by 1939 , and the war and the partition made it imperative .
after independence , the railways became a wholly state - owned enterprise .
the national coal development corporation ( ncdc ) was , therefore , set up to improve the organisational needs of the new coal programme .
in the early seventies it was decided that the coal industry be taken over entirely by the public sector .
there has been impressive , if not always enough , progress in this sector since 1950 .
the number of villages electrified moved up from 3,061 in 1950 - 51 to 4.9 lakhs in 1992 .
this phenomenal increase in capacity was made possible by a number of giant multi - purpose power projects completed since the first five - year plan .
as a result , a serious power shortage was feared during the last phase of the second plan .
to meet such a contingency , the planning commission included electricity in the list of ' core projects ' and provided for advance planning for power generation .
apart from the grave hazard these plants pose , the cost of nuclear energy is considered prohibitive even in affluent countries .
it was steady at this level following the steep rise in oil prices in the following years .
after the initial success in bombay high and bassein north and south , the prospects in this area do not seem to be unlimited .
these efforts have been rewarded recently when oil and gas were struck in the bay of bengal and krishna - godavari basin .
this discovery has improved the prospects of finding oil on the east coast of india .
energy consumption in the country is low by world standards .
dependence on oil in the country is increasing , contrary to the global trend .
railway stock increased significantly and composition changed more rapidly an indication of the technological changes in the railway system .
the number of wagons increased rapidly during the first fifteen years of planning .
there has been no perspective for development in such a vital sector and road building programmes were drawn up from one five - year plan to another .
with a tremendous backlog and multiplying transport needs , the progress made or envisaged must be considered utterly inadequate .
actually only 12,000 villages are estimated to have been covered by the end of 1977 - 78 .
he made the durga puja an occasion to fraternise with his fellowmen and in this his children also participated every year .
even as a mere boy of fifteen , subhas chandra wrote moving letters to his mother prabhabati about his experiences in their native village .
moving in the footsteps of his father , sarat chandra went out of his way to promote village reconstruction work in kodalia .
among them was m . n . roy .
subhas chandra wrote in his autobiography : " the earliest recollection i have of myself is that i used to feel like a thoroughly insignificant being " .
it is interesting to trace the significant steps in the evolution of the personality of one who considered himself in the beginning to be so thoroughly insignificant .
subhas was sent , as others before him , to the protestant european school in cuttack in 1902 for his primary education .
fourthly , he advocated the setting up of a permanent national research council .
what was needed , he said , was far - reaching cooperation between science and politics .
there were three reasons why subhas chandra was unacceptable to the right wing of the congress for a second term as president .
the first was his unremitting campaign to stiffen the opposition to any compromise with britain .
when subhas chandra announced his decision to contest for a second term , it was immediately disapproved by the majority of the then congress leadership .
he wanted that in a democratic mass party like the congress , the presidential election should be held on the basis of policies and programmes .
he was prepared to step down provided another uncompromising national leader like narendra deva was chosen as the president .
pattabhi sitaramayya , a nominee of the right wing , was set up against subhas chandra with the blessings of mahatma gandhi .
eventually , in the contest subhas chandra won with a comfortable majority of over two hundred votes .
then slowly a new vision dawned on me and i began to recover my mental balance , as well as my faith in man and in my countrymen .
after all tripuri was not india . . . in spite of what i had experienced in tripuri , how could i lose my fundamental faith in man ?
jawaharlal nehru and rajendra prasad visited subhas chandra at jamadoba and held talks with him with a view to finding a solution to the deadlock .
the all india congress committee was convened in calcutta at the end of april 1939 .
unfortunately , no agreement or settlement was possible .
it was clear that the mass appeal of the campaign was tremendous as was evident from subhas ' s increasing popularity as he toured round the country .
thus , two opposing viewpoints emerged out of the national mainstream at the most crucial moment of indian history .
the first all india conference of the forward bloc was held in bombay on the 22nd june , 1939 .
he utilised all his editorial skill and dialectical logical attack , repartee , thrust , irony and satire to project his political thinking before his readers .
regardless of the british onslaught and the antipathy of the congress right wing , subhas chandra organised a second conference of the forward bloc in nagpur in june 1940 .
at nagpur , subhas chandra gave to the forward bloc and the people a new slogan , " all power to the indian people " .
the european war had then reached the most critical phase .
hitler had overrun almost the whole of western europe and italy had joined the war .
on his way back to calcutta from nagpur , subhas called on mahatma gandhi at sewagram and this was to be their last meeting .
mahatma gandhi disagreed with subhas chandra but told him that the latter was free to follow the course that his conscience and judgement dictated him to do .
gandhiji concluded by saying that if subhas succeeded in achieving freedom for his country by methods he advocated , mahatma gandhi would be the first person to congratulate him .
jawa - harlal nehru , the then congress president , added his voice to the appeal to the people of bengal for contributions .
a year later , the calcutta corporation placed a plot of land in subhas chandra ' s hands .
he placed the proposal before the national poet rabindra nath tagore and requested him to give a name to the proposed building .
tagore heartily approved of subhas chandra ' s plan and gave the name " mahajati sadan " , in other wordshouse of the nation .
while in prison , he was elected unopposed from a dacca constituency in east bengal to the central legislative assembly .
india could win independence only if she actively entered the field of international politics in the midst of the war crisis .
he felt it would be a gross political blunder to remain inactive in prison while history was being made elsewhere .
he found no possibility of being released in the legal manner .
in this connection , he wrote a number of historic letters to the government , one of which he called his political testament .
he wrote therein , inter alia : " though there may be no immediate , tangible gain , no suffering , no sacrifice is ever futile . . . .
" in this mortal world everything perishes and will perishbut ideas , ideals and dreams do not .
at peshawar , a transformation took place in subhas chandra ' s disguise .
in abad khan ' s house , he was made conversant with the social habits and customs of pathans so that his social and public behaviour was correct .
he discarded his former attire and was given full - fledged pathan dress including the headgear .
the three travellers started their trek only a furlong away from the actual tribal border .
they had to scale stiff mountains , parts of which were covered with snow .
they rested for the next two nights at small villages on the way .
on the 28th january when it was well past midnight , they reached the first village in afghan territory .
on the 29th january , to keep up appearances , they went to the shrine of adda sharif near jalalabad .
there , they also established contact with an important political worker hazi mohammad amin .
on 30th january , they set out for kabul in a tonga .
changing over a truck on the way , they reached the check - post bud khak the next morning .
in kabul , both of them were complete strangers .
bhagat ram , therefore , traced out an old acquaintance from peshawar , uttam chand malhotra who was doing business in kabul .
subhas chandra shifted to uttam chand ' s residence in the middle of february and shut himself up in one room in uttam chand ' s house .
here , he found friendly and comfortable shelter .
subhas chandra ' s first meeting with quaroni lasted a whole night .
subhas was absolutely clear in his own mind as to the technique of his future struggle .
quaroni sent a favourable report to rome .
arrangements were made that mrs . quaroni would call at uttam chand ' s shop from time to time to exchange communications .
from samarkhand , they travelled by rail to moscow , from where they flew to berlin reaching there on the 2nd april , 1941 .
subhas chandra had written all these during his enforced stay in kabul .
the next morning bhagat ram joined sarat chandra at victoria memorial gardens and narrated to him the entire story from peshawar to the russian frontier .
sarat chandra put bhagat ram in touch with satya ranjan bakshi - - a veteran congressman , revolutionary and trusted lieutenant of subhas for future work .
he also outlined the nature of the work that had to be organised in afghanistan , in the tribal territories and inside india .
he also asked for facilities for radio propaganda directed towards india .
he submitted a supplementary note to his original memorandum three weeks later .
he pointed out the importance of an open declaration of the german government on the question of india ' s independence .
he also undertook a tour of other countries like italy , france and austria with a view to establishing friendly contacts and gaining adherents .
the department was directed by adam von trott who had been to oxford as a student and was quite conversant with the indian problem .
nevertheless , in furtherance of his strategic objectives he wanted to make the best of a rather unfavourable situation .
towards the end of 1941 , he was in a position to establish a free india centre in berlin .
he got together a ramakrishna - vivekananda group of young people .
both inside the family and outside , the group aroused concern and opposition but to no avail .
as he fought contrary forces in the family and society , a battle royal was also in progress with inner forces of his lower self .
at this most critical period , subhas felt more at home when away from home .
he eagerly read all kinds of books on yogic practices , thinking that all that mattered was mental and spiritual exercise .
whenever a monk of any description came their way , subhas and his group would rush to him .
the first political impetus subhas received was at the very end of his school career when an emissary of a calcutta - based group met him at cuttack .
netaji then made a logical defence of the steps he had taken for the attainment of india ' s freedom since his escape from india in 1941 .
" father of our nation !
in this holy war for india ' s liberation we ask for your blessings and good wishes " .
in october 1944 , netaji was invited for consultations in tokyo after a change in government there .
however , when results were published , it was found that subhas chandra had secured the second rank in the whole university .
for a young student coming from a mofussil town , life in calcutta was not necessarily a welcome change .
in fact , it had been the ruin of many promising souls .
however , subhas came to calcutta with certain ideas and principles fixed in his mind .
he had decided not to follow the beaten track but lead a life conducive to his own spiritual advancement and the uplift of his fellowmen .
the roads to delhi are many and delhi still remains our goal .
do not be depressed at our temporary failure .
there is no power on earth that can keep india enslaved . "
since the fall of burma , netaji is believed to have been planning to move into soviet territory to continue his struggle for indian independence .
it was during the last crucial twenty - five years of the indian liberation struggle that netaji played his role .
he based his politics on a deep and scientific analysis of indian polity since ancient times and particularly an objective study of british conquest and rule .
he came to the irrevocable conclusion that the fundamental interests of the indian people in colonial subjugation and those of british imperialism were irreconcilable .
therefore , any adjustment or compromise between these two forces was impossible .
the congress had been committed for many years to a policy of active opposition to british exploitation of india in imperialist wars anywhere .
netaji wanted the congress to stand steadfastly by that policy and intensify the mass struggle in order to bring british governance of india to a standstill .
since netaji disappeared from the scene more than five decades ago , the world political situation as well as the national situation have changed profoundly .
threats to human freedom remain as ever before .
even as a human being and thinker , netaji was seeking a new philosophya new ethical conception in human affairs .
indeed , it was when communities came into existence that some rules of conduct were brought in as well .
disrespect of community rules was tantamount to disrespect of the community .
lawbreakers were treated severely , and punishment was executed collectively .
the main aims of the administration of justice are two - fold : the search for truth and the attempt to make people abide by the rules of law .
in ancient times , according to vinogradoff , more emphasis was laid on solving problems than on the search for truth .
justice was administered by the king and manu and narada have compared the position of the king to that of a surgeon .
in much of india , it was through the danda , or the fear of punishment , that people were made to honour the rights of others .
it was the king ' s duty to punish lawbreakers and ensure that conditions were conducive for the smooth functioning of society .
every person had the right to receive justice and it was the state which delivered it to him or her .
but though powerful , the king , who symbolised the state , did not have the right to legislate .
he was the upholder and promulgator of law and the administrator of justice .
he presided over the highest court of the state , but he had to perform his duties as prescribed in the law books known as codes .
thus , the establishment of order by punishing offenders was among the most useful and important duties of the ruler .
as life was simple , the maintenance of law and order was well organised and courts were not necessary .
no mention is made in vedic literature of a separate body called the court , since the king was himself a court of both civil and criminal jurisdiction .
in ancient india justice was administered according to the smritis , and was one of the most important and obligatory functions of a king .
it was his responsibility to protect the people through the proper and impartial administration of justice .
any indifference towards this important function was supposed to brihg calamity to the king himself as well as to his people .
ancient indian jurists devoted a great deal of attention to evolving a law governing the administration of justice .
the writings on the subject suggest that the seat of the highest court should be located in the capital city .
different kinds of courts in ancient india the court presided over by a king was the highest court .
ii shreni ( corporation ) : as in commercial guild arbitration these courts were made of corporations of persons following the same craft , profession or trade .
apart from the above , there was the pratistitha , a court established at a particular village or town .
fines and corporal punishment could only be decided by the king .
the people ' s courts consisted of panchayatdars .
these had the authority to decide all civil and criminal cases except those that involved trial for an offence committed with violence .
a shreni could review the decision of a kula and a gana had the power to review the decision of a shreni .
judges had power to review the decisions of a gana , and the king was the highest court of appeal , his decision being final .
the prerogative of the sovereign to function as the highest court of his kingdom was recognised .
the king ( raja ) , the chief justice ( pradvivaka ) , and the judges ( sabhyas ) were the judicial officers of the court .
the accountant ( ganaka ) , the scribe ( lekhaka ) and the bailiff ( swapurusha ) used to be the non - judicial officers of the court .
i a judge should not be cruel , he should be sweet - tempered , kind , clever and energetic but not greedy ;
sudras , however , were never recommended for such appointments as according to the ethos of that period they were not supposed to learn the sacred tekts .
all the dharmasastras and smritis clearly enjoined that dispensation of justice was the highest dharma of judges . ;
gautama lays down that in administering justice the king has to derive his law from threvsources :
such provisions which speak of the independence of the judiciary and the supremacy of dharma as binding even on the king , show the importance of justice .
this was also in conformity with the definition that " law was the king of kings " .
the law received its sanction from the faith of the people and that of the king in dharma .
the court hall was called dharmadhikarana ( hall of justice ) .
the smritis prescribed that a spacious hall in the palace should be reserved for the king to hold court .
trees should be grown in the premises and water should be made available in the vicinity .
however , what appealed to subhas was not the mysticism around aurobindo , but his writings and philosophy and his conception of the synthesis of yoga .
so long as politics did not interest subhas directly , he continued to meet religious teachers and involved himself in all kinds of social service .
at college , he began to neglect his studies because most of the lectures he found uninteresting .
such activities helped him to shed his introvert tendencies .
he became increasingly aware of the inequity of the existing social system with affluence on the one hand and stark misery on the other .
such awareness made him a rebel against the system and led him to ponder deeply over the fundamentals of social relations .
as in cuttack during his late school years , so in calcutta during his early college career , subhas continued with ' sadhu ' - - hunting .
he was required to observe the demeanour of the witnesses in order to gauge the truth of the statements made by them before the court .
the king was supposed to be very attentive during the trial .
there was a clear distinction between civil and criminal cases .
in all civil matters , the king had to abide by the opinion of the judges if he was presiding over the court .
if not , the verdict of the court itself was final , subject only to the review powers of the king .
it is only in criminal cases that a special provision was made vesting the king with the power to fix the quantum of penalty .
kautilya ' s concept of justice the judicial organisation and legal procedures of the mauryan period were based on the arthasastra ' s concept of law .
this was the outcome of social and economic conditions of a particular country and the country ' s capability to deal with those .
he regarded danda as the fountainhead of politics .
their main function was to dispose of such cases as arose out of violation of traditional rules and regulations .
they could only impose nominal fines and their scope was limited to the application of dharmasthiya laws .
the kantakasodhana was very important fitwn the social and constitutional points of view .
it regulated various economic and social problems , and also demonstrated that the origin of the court lay in royal ordinances .
its jurisdiction included regulations for the police , public safety , criminal punishment and proceedings for simple as well as serious offences .
the kantakasodhana court falls into two main divisions as it relates to the urban and the rural respectively .
another important function of this court was to save the country from famines and epidemics .
the local population was expected to be better acquainted with local problems .
thus , disputes about boundaries were to be settled by the village elders .
a sense of public responsibility in all aspects of village life was expected from every village .
the arthasastra simply speaks of the appointment of three dharmasthas and three amatyas for the court .
it could not have been possible for this court to function everywhere specially to attend to cases at smaller units .
therefore it seems probable that there was decentralisation of judiciary to some extent .
the emperor then states :
some single person only learns this and even he ( only ) a portion but not the whole .
he who is fatigued in administration of justice will not prosper .
from the above extract of the royal command , we can deduce that in judicial procedures under ashoka :
i the city judges were high ranking officers , that is , mahamatras who dealt with many thousands of men ;
ii their duty was to execute the emperor ' s orders and they were supposed to administer justice according to niti ( dandaniti ) and decide cases ;
iii the judges had to be impartial and were not to fall victim to the many dispositions enumerated or to anger or to hurry .
in fact ashoka ' s judicial system was based on niti which has been understood to be dandaniti .
the edict says that it is desirable that there be impartiality in judicial proceedings and punishments .
kautilya and manu have put forward two different sys - tems for the gradation of courts .
kautilya does not attach the same importance to popular courts as does manu .
in the former ' s scheme , courts were instituted at sangrahana , dronamukha , sthaniya and where districts met .
prior to akbar ' s reign traditional muslim law was applied even in matters of judicial procedure .
however , strict islamic law came to an end in the eighteenth century , after the arrival of the british in india .
in the capital , under the king were diwan ala and chief qazi ( qazi - ul - quzat ) .
the emperor sat in the diwan - i - khas trying cases .
the court of the emperor was the highest court of appeal , the supreme tribunal of the land .
the darogha - i - adalat and the kotwal were required to be present on such occasions to carry out the judgements given by the emperor .
the supreme qazi was called the qazi - ul - quzat , and he appointed qazis in every province .
friday was a holiday .
the chief sadr was called the sadr - ul - sadur or the sadr - i - jahan and also sadr - i - kul .
his duty was to appoint a local sadr in every province .
the provincial sadrs were instructed by the chief sadr to maintain lists of the recipients of rent - free lands and daily allowances .
the sadr was required to see that those persons entitled to stipends carried out the imperial orders .
he also noted their deaths .
the emperor ' s charities were distributed through the chief sadr .
courts of secular cases these courts were not subordinate to the qazi .
they administered the unwritten customs , common law or tribal codes and had no concern with religious law .
jahangir ( akbar ' s son ) became famous for the rendition of justice .
cases in villages were decided by the village elders on the basis of the customs , practices and faiths of the parties .
the caste courts decided the cases of parties belonging to the same caste , with social sanctions behind them .
in the larger villages classed as qasbas , a qazi was appointed and he administered justice .
even if the qazis were appointed , the parties could go to trade guilds and communal courts .
the sultans of delhi and the mughal emperors did not find it profitable and practicable to interfere with these and therefore left them alone .
akbar recognised the village panchayat as a legally established court of justice and upheld its decisions .
pargana courts the three types of pargana courts were the shiqdar , qazi and amin .
the shiqdar tried purely secular criminal cases .
the qazi tried civil , criminal and religious cases .
the pargana qazi had the power to appoint his assistants in the different centres depending upon the needs of the locality .
these assistants were called naib qazis .
the qazi ' s duties were the same as mentioned earlier .
the amin was expected to help the kotwal in his judicial and police duties .
the qazi in a sarkar was appointed on the recommendation of the chief qazi of the province .
the kotwal was in charge of the police department in a town and its suburbs , while the faujdar ' s jurisdiction was in the rural areas .
the kotwal nearly combined all the functions of the muhatasib in addition to having judicial power .
the kotwal possessed judicial powers to deal with offences , particularly with regard to theft , etc .
he possessed an equivalent jurisdiction with the qazi in the above cases , but with certain exceptions .
moreover , he could use pressure , influence and strictness to accomplish his duties .
a muhatasib could admonish and report cases to the ruler , but did not have powers to imprison anyone , because the power to imprison belonged to the qazi .
he had powers to reprimand dishonest persons guilty of breach of trust .
this is what abu hanifa says .
he was a censor of morals , a municipal executive and a judge in certain types of cases with limited powers of punishment .
iii fix the price of goods in the market and enforce the use of correct weights and measures .
the power of the censor as the officer to enforce the prophet ' s laws was supreme .
there is an interesting case of enforcement of morals .
in 1667 , a portuguese friar who had accepted the muslim faith reverted to his old faith again .
the most notable trial of all was that of sarmad , the eminent sufi of delhi .
his only fault was his nakedness which is against islam .
several early european travellers have left interesting accounts of the trials held by the mughal emperors .
in ad 1511 , william finch writes :
however , from the beginning , english residents in these settlements remained subject to their own laws which were admin - istered by their own officers .
however , encouragement to the sitar and its style came from the later half of the eighteenth century .
the constitution of the criminal courts was also defective .
lord cornwallis , by regula - tions made in 1790 and 1793 , entirely remodelled the judicial system .
courts of circuits composed of english judges , and of the qazi and mooftee , were instituted .
the circuit courts failed to provide prompt administra - tion of justice and were consequently abolished in 1829 .
their powers were transferred to the commissioners of revenue who now became criminal judges in all cases of importance .
but the task was found too heavy for them , and accordingly a regulation of 1831 invested zillah and city judges with criminal jurisdiction .
the act was a temporary measure and was repealed in 1872 .
many of the earlier regulations were directed at removing some of the defects of the mohamedan criminal jurisprudence .
in 1780 the government of bengal issued a code of regulations for the administration of justice , and the following year a revised code was issued .
the same principle was subsequently applied to punjab by the punjab laws act of 1872 .
in 1833 the attention of british parliament was drawn to the unwieldy , confusing , and obscure state of law in british india .
the following were some of the key features of the system of administration of criminal justice established in this country :
i a combination of judicial and executive functions were vested in the same officer .
ii the differential treatment accorded to european british subjects and their partial immunity from the juris - diction of the ordinary courts .
iii a general absence of the system of trial by jury .
the ipc deals specifically with various offences and details what acts will constitute an offence and what will afford an excuse or defence to a charge of an offence .
he also tried his hand at youth organisation for their physical , intellectual and moral advancement .
he campaigned against un - touchability .
he took active part in organising social events during religious ceremonies and pujas .
during this time , he also practised , as never before , searching self - analysis .
while waiting for something to come up , he tried to get himself recruited to the 49th bengal regiment .
he was disqualified because of defective vision .
eventually , he came to know that the university might be amenable to his re - admission provided he could find an alternative college .
present - day criminal courts lie on three separate rungs of an ascending ladder .
in every district , there are courts of judicial magistrates of first class and second class .
the sessions court is subordinate to the high court .
similarly the state government can appoint a special magistrate from time to time in a particular area and give him such powers of the magistrate as it deems fit .
the state government can appoint additional district magistrates .
in default of payment of fines , the court can pass a further sentence of imprisonment .
a magistrate of the first class has wider jurisdiction and powers than a second class magistrate .
sessions court immediately above the magistrate courts are the sessions court presided over by judges known as sessions judges .
a sentence of death , popularly known as a capital sentence , has , however , to be confirmed by the high court before it can be carried out .
a sessions judge also hears appeals from the orders of first class magistrates .
sessions judges also exercise revisional powers similar to those exercised by first class magistrates .
the court of ses - sions has jurisdiction once a case has properly come before it , that is , on a legal order of committal .
thus serious cases of death , murder , robbery , etc . are tried by the sessions judge and not by the assistant sessions judge .
the main functions of the high court , however , are to hear appeals , revisions and references .
all persons convicted by sessions judges are entitled to appeal to the high court .
a sentence of death must be confirmed by the high court before it can be carried out whether there is an appeal by the convict or not .
revision cases sent up by the district magistrates or sessions judges are the exclusive concern of the high court .
these are the three main tiers in our criminal courts .
procedure the procedure for criminal trials is provided in the criminal procedure code .
the accused is called before the court and the charge is explained to him .
if he admits the truth of the accusation , he may be convicted and sentenced forth - with .
if he professes innocence , the magistrate proceeds to hear the evidence against him .
the accused can then make another statement and call for defence evidence .
the more serious offences are tried as warrant cases .
the procedure for dealing with these is slightly different .
the object of this is to give the accused person full opportunity to refute the charge against him which in - volves a more elaborate procedure .
a sessions trial is held by the sessions judge .
after the evidence in the case has been recorded and arguments heard , the sessions judge addresses the accused .
he explains the charge against the accused , comments on the evidence produced by the prosecution and by the defence and then poses certain questions to the accused .
after hearing the parties or their advocates , the judge determines whether the accused is guilty or not .
costs in criminal cases no costs are awarded to the prosecution against the convicted person .
the costs are borne by the state or the parties .
however , while imposing fines , the court may direct that a part of fine realised may be given to the injured party by way of compensation .
in appropriate cases when adjournment is asked for the court may order payment of costs to the prosecution or the accused as the case may be .
trial court appellate court i
high court a ) from conviction in extraordinary criminal jurisdiction , supreme court ;
the appeals from the senior sub - judge , first class , lie to the high court .
similarly , appeals from the original orders and judgements of the district courts and the additional district courts lie to the high court .
the memorandum of appeal should be precise in stating the substantial question of law involved in the appeal .
it is only where the high court is satisfied at the stage of admission that a substantial question of law is involved that it will admit the second appeal .
however , the aggrieved party can always approach the supreme court under article 136 of the constitution .
the high court may make such order in the case as it deems fit .
apart from provisions for appeals and revisions , there are provisions in the code of review of a judgement or decree .
these are given in the circumstances which are provided in section 114 and order 47 of the code which are :
appeals to the supreme court are also provided under section 109 of the code in the following cases .
third year in college was given to soldiery .
he , therefore , decided to take up this new subject in his m . a . course .
one evening his father called him to his room where he also found his elder brother sarat chandra .
he took counsel with himself and within a few hours made up his mind to accept the offer .
once again , his plans had been upset by the superior force of circumstances .
he could not even dream of passing the indian civil service examination and accepting a job under the british government .
language to be used in the courts the constitution of india provides that english is the language used in the high court and supreme court of india .
similarly , local languages can be used in the proceedings and judgements in subordinate courts .
the central government as well as the state governments are also subject to the jurisdiction of the civil courts in all civil matters .
these are pretrial only in the sense that they are preparatory to the trial and intended to reduce the area of controversy .
these interlocutory proceedings relate to obtaining orders for the following from the courts :
ii admission and denial of documents and facts ;
iii discovery , inspection and production of documents ;
iv temporary injuction and appointment of receiver or commissioner .
commission may also be issued to any other court within the country and a letter of request to courts outside india .
the prescribed procedure also permits issue of warrant to arrest a recalcitrant person or a defendant and / or require him to give security .
the activist judges believe in exercising their power , authority and influence in rendering positive and effective justice between the parties .
they may also ' persuade ' parties to settle their dispute amicably .
in this process the provisions of the indian evidence act govern the trial .
there are stringent rules as to relevancies and the kind of questions that may be put without objection .
as indicated above , some judges sometimes do question the witness with a view to advancing justice .
a witness may be declared ' hostile ' if he appears to be deliberately deposing against the party who summoned him .
administratively , however , the chief justice has some special functions and powers which the puisne judges do not have .
a judge of the high court holds office until he attains the age of 62 .
appeal from a decision of the writ court lies to the supreme court and can take more than ten years .
advocate general like the attorney general , the highest law officer in the state is known as the advocate general .
for the mental and moral sciences tripos in cambridge , he did not do much beyond attending lectures .
as to extra - curricular activities , he participated in the indian majlis and the union society .
what greatly impressed him in england was the freedom , respect and prestige enjoyed by the student community .
this , he thought , had a very salutary effect on their character .
there were certain qualities of englishmen which he admitted and about which he wrote back to friends at home .
the two assignments , working simultaneously for the civil service examination and the cambridge tripos left him without any time for relaxation .
it was said that subhas ' s physical presence would bring about sobriety among even the most wayward among them .
he carried on regular correspondence with his friends at home , narrating his experiences and giving them information about life and conditions in england .
whenever any eminent indian visited england and lectured at the universities or the indian majlis , subhas was an enthusiastic organiser .
he felt very proud when any indian visiting lecturer distinguished himself .
for the civil service , one had to study a large number of subjects so that in actual life they might be well equipped in administering the country .
there were nine major subjects including political science , economics , english , history and modern european history .
the tribunal acts with the aid of assessors who are selected from a panel prepared by the central government .
this panel includes representatives of trade , industry , agriculture and persons who have a working knowledge of the railways .
the appeal against the order of the tribunal lies to supreme court under article 136 of the constitution .
apart from punishment , the act also provides for forfeiture of the property of such persons .
the central or state government can appoint one or more additional judges for the designated court .
these designated courts have been given exclusive jurisdiction to try offences under this act .
for every designated court , the central government or the state government appoints a person to be a public prosecutor which includes additional public prosecutors or special public prosecutors .
in interlocutory orders , the accused can approach the supreme court under article 136 of the constitution .
in addition , the victim or injured party also had to pay court fees .
it provides expeditious and summary procedure to be adopted by the claims tribunal .
under the act more than one claims tribunal can be set up and their territorial jurisdiction is specified by notification constituting the tribunals .
the claims tribunal consists of such member or members as the government may find desirable .
generally the chairman is a retired judge of the high court or a district judge or a person qualified for appointment as judge of the high court .
the claims tribunal is a court subordinate to the high court and the high court can transfer cases from one tribunal to another in the same state .
the vehicle should be mechanically propelled and the accident should be the result of such use or misuse .
the owner of the property damaged in the motor accident is entitled to maintain a claim for damages simplicitor ; so also the person injured in an accident .
the claim for damage to property can be filed independently even without there being any bodily injury .
they can also file a cross - appeal which is heard along with the appeal .
the appeal also lies directly from the award of the tribunal to the supreme court as a special leave petition under article 136 of the constitution .
in such a case , the option lies with the claimant to choose one or the other tribunal .
the rapid growth of industry in india has also meant the introduction of new and sophisticated machinery .
given that many of the people who work these machines are often poor and illiterate , there can be the danger of accidents .
the workmens ' compensation act 1923 thus provides a machinery for quick disposal of disputes relating to compensation .
commissioners are appointed by notifications in the official gazette by the state government for a particular area or areas .
more than one commissioner can be appointed in one area ; in such cases the commissioners ' business is regulated by notification between them .
the parties can settle the claim among themselves and get it recorded .
he then requires the particular employer to deposit the prescribed amount .
arbitration is an extra - judicial forum and an alternative method of settlement of such disputes .
from early times , the decisions of panchayats were accepted as binding .
the decision of a kula or kin group was subject to revision by the sreni which , in turn , could be revised by the puga .
from the decision of the puga , appeal was maintainable to pradvivaca and finally to the sovereign and the prince .
the objects of arbitration are speed , economy , convenience , simplicity of procedure , secrecy and the encouragement of healthy and friendly relations between the disputants .
the arbitrators must give reasonable opportunity to the parties to be heard either ' in person or , if the parties desire , through their advocates .
the arbitrators must give their award within four months .
the umpire has also to give award within four months .
such reference is known as reference by the court .
the judgement , which is known as an award , is given by the arbitrators .
no appeal has been provided from such an award to any court .
such lok adalats are now being held by various government departments such as the electricity boards , the telephone department , etc .
like any other courts and tribunals , such adalats can also be abused by the parties / lawyers / authorities / politicians .
the institution of the village panchayat has a long history in india .
subhas wanted the congress to open an intelligence department and a propaganda department .
booklets were to be published in all the languages of india on each and every question of indian national life .
the result was a stalemate .
the latter half of 1921 , marked a great advance for the congress in bengal in which subhas chandra played a very significant role .
gandhiji had given to the party a new constitution under which the organisation acquired a mass base .
the year 1922 began in an uncertain but excited mood .
the congress rose to the occasion and rushed to the succour of stricken humanity with subhas chandra bose leading the first batch of volunteers .
the relief operations directed by subhas were so successful that they enhanced substantially the prestige of the congress , while government efforts were niggardly and half - hearted .
towards the end of the decade , the youth movement in india became a strong force with subhas chandra bose and jawaharlal nehru as its two guiding stars .
at the gaya congress , which subhas attended , deshbandhu ' s proposal was defeated .
his position as the president , therefore , became rather anomalous .
pandit motilal led the party in the central assembly while deshbandhu did the same in the bengal council .
in calcutta , deshbandhu launched his english daily paper forward after the delhi congress and entrusted subhas with its organisation .
at the instance of deshbandhu , subhas chandra was appointed the chief executive officer , - - that is , the head of the municipal administration .
deshbandhu ' s mayoral address was in the nature of a charter of civic rights , civic progress and civic freedom .
subhas chandra ' s task was to convert the programme into concrete action .
for the first time , khadi became the official uniform of civic employees and many streets and parks named after britishers were renamed after india ' s greatest men .
even children ' s clinics were started in different parts of calcutta from where free milk was distributed to needy children .
the chief executive officer showed remarkable agility in his work schedule .
within a few months , subhas was able to give a new orientation and momentum to the administration of the corporation .
the practice of giving civic reception to british dignitaries was given up and instead the same was given to nationalist leaders when they visited the city .
to promote civic consciousness among citizens , a weekly journal , the calcutta municipal gazette , was started .
a commercial museum was established with the purpose of promoting indian goods .
sub - has chandra accepted half his salary as the chief executive and gave the other half to charity .
as congress volunteers moved on tarakeswar , the government came out heavily on the side of autocratic mohant and attacked them mercilessly .
in spite of serious opposition , deshbandhu was able to carry the day and have bengal pact ratified .
deshbandhu and subhas had similar views on revolutionary terrorism and violence .
thus , such acts were inevitable explosions in the course of a national liberation struggle .
towards the end of 1926 , the legislatures were dissolved and fresh elections announced .
the bengal congress set up subhas chandra as their candidate from a north calcutta constituency .
he had a strong opponent in the leader of the liberals in bengal who had defeated the swarajist candidate in the previous election .
he could not shake off persistent temperature following an attack of pneumonia and lost weight rapidly .
he was taken to rangoon for examination by a medical board which recommended that he should not be kept in prison .
they offered to release him if he would board a ship bound for europe from rangoon without touching indian shores .
another major cause of the political slump in india in 1925 - 27 was the virtual retirement of mahatma gandhi from active politics .
he confined himself to the propagation of khadi and constructive work among the depressed classes .
the swaraj party disintegrated steadily after deshbandhu ' s death .
deshbandhu ' s dynamic leadership had brought together diverse elementsrightist , centrist and leftistunder the banner of the party .
his death led the dissimilar elements to seek new moorings according to ideological inclinations .
his first task was to get well as quickly as possible and return to active public life .
he spent some months in shillong in the latter half of 1927 with his family for recuperation .
although he was a member of the legislative council , his main concern then was the congress party , the all india base for political action .
the madras congress adopted a resolution boycotting the simon commission " at every stage and in every form " .
a proposal . to convene an all parties conference was also adopted to draw up a constitution for free india .
what is more , the congress defined the goal of the indian people to be complete national independence .
the newly emerging youth movement in india exercised a definite influence on congress policy from this point onwards .
when the simon commission arrived in india in february 1928 , there was an all - india hartal under the direction of the congress working committee .
in bengal , the congress under subhas ' s leadership went a step further by organising an intensive campaign for boycott of british goods .
while the nehru committee was busy thrashing out the principles of the new constitution , subhas embarked on an extensive tour which took him to poona .
presiding over a political conference there , subhas chandra went ahead with preaching his own ideas on political organisation , programme and plan of action for the congress .
they continued to be general secretaries of the congress .
the independence of india league had its echo in a very important area of national life , viz , the students ' movement .
the need was , therefore , felt for an organisation of students themselves that would fight for and defend their rights .
thereafter , students ' organisations grew up all over bengal and in due course in other provinces of the country as well .
as the year progressed , the political barometer continued to rise in india and it affected the world of labour also .
there was already a strike among railway workers at kharagpur near calcutta , the year before .
in 1928 , a strike broke out in the tata steel works at jamshedpur .
this was followed by large - scale strikes in the textile industry in bombay , among railwaymen in lilooah near calcutta and a number of other places .
organisation of youth engaged subhas ' s equal attention .
in his addresses to students and the youth , subhas chandra preached the philosophy of activism and modernism as opposed to that of passivism and obscurantism .
he said that the madras resolution had given new prestige to india in international politics which they could not afford to lose .
subhas charxdra ' s amendment was defeated by 973 votes to 1350 .
subhas chandra was of the opinion that the temporising resolution of the calcutta congress killed precious time and demoralised the people who were expecting a call to go forward .
the only silver lining , according to subhas , was that the left wing had gained enough strength in the congress .
evidently , he was playing for time and preparing himself for the fight ahead .
on the other hand , during 1929 new developments took place in three definite directions which helped to maintain the morale of the people .
the third important development in the indian situation during 1929 was the increasing unrest among the working class which had already started in the preceding year .
subhas chandra , who was closely associated with the defence committee , actively assisted in the defence of the prisoners .
when the governor dissolved the council and ordered fresh elections , the congress party returned with added strength .
the remarkable organising ability of subhas and his associates in the congress party was also seen in the field of journalism .
the nationalist newspaperforward was penalised so heavily by the court for defamation of the government - owned east indian railway that it was forced to closed down .
in the latter half of 1929 , at the instance of mahatma gandhi , a resolution was passed calling upon congressmen to resign from the legislatures .
however , notwithstanding their popularity we are still faced with the problems of their beginnings and migrations .
they fought their last battle as free men in 1857 under the flag of the last moghul emperor bahadur shah .
after their defeat in this first war of independence , the governance of india was taken over directly by the british crown in 1858 .
british imperialism set out in a systematic manner to cast its stranglehold over india and a new era in the contemporary history of india began .
the year of birth of subhas chandra bose - 1897 - has a significance of its own in the history of the critical ninety years that followed 1857 .
" i am an extremist and my principle isall or none ' .
differences came to a head a month before the lahore congress when elections to the bengal congress committee were held .
there was a keen contest and the group led by bose won .
by and large , however , the majority in the bengal congress backed by strong revolutionary elements supported sub - has throughout his political career .
for janaki - nath , to set out for cuttack in search of a career was by itself an adventure .
fortune favours the brave and by the time subhas was born , janakinath had reached the top of the legal profession in his new domicile .
he became government pleader and was elected the first non - official chairman of cuttack municipality .
in 1912 , he was a member of the bengal legislative council .
by such means , the british government expected to get the indians to go on fighting amongst themselves instead of presenting a united front .
in april , lord irwin was replaced as the viceroy by lord willingdon , a hard - core imperialist .
with his arrival , the official attitude began to stiffen and officials began to violate the terms of the gandhi - irwin pact .
in gujarat , the united provinces and bengal , the situation was particularly unsatisfactory .
mahatma gandhi personally handed over a charge - sheet containing details of breaches of the delhi pact to the home secretary , government of india .
he also had long talks with the new viceroy .
thus , the vicious cycle of governmental repression , revolutionary - terrorism and official counter - terrorism went on .
even during the period of the gandhi - irwin truce , some revolutionary prisoners were sentenced to death and hanged .
a british socialist writer brailsford told subhas chandra after a visit that the situation in the united provinces was verging on an agrarian revolution .
soon after his arrival , mahatma gandhi wrote to lord willingdon seeking clarification of the real attitude of the government .
the viceroy sent a negative and unfriendly reply .
the congress working committee , thereupon , adopted a resolution which the viceroy found unacceptable and declined to see gandhiji .
the stage was , thus , set for the resumption of the second civil disobedience movement .
in the first week of january 1932 , the british government launched its offensive against the congress and nationalist organisations throughout india .
as gandhiji fasted in his prison cell in poona , frantic appeals were sent to him from all quarters to desist .
as in 1930 , subhas chandra watched the march of events in 1932 from behind the prison bars .
he felt strongly that the british government had this time definitely got the better of the congress .
as the year drew to a close , congressmen became more interested in the anti - untouch - ability campaign and temple entry bills rather than in civil disobedience .
as during his exile in burma , he was reduced to a skeleton .
in the enforced absence of sarat chandra , his wife bivabati carried on negotiations on subhas ' s behalf with the government in delhi .
he lectured at many places on the indian national movement , indian history , civilization and culture .
he sought the moral support of all classes of people in these countries for india ' s struggle against british imperialism .
in vienna , he established the austria - india society .
in czechoslovakia , on the one hand he received medical treatment at the spas of karlsbad and on the other , he established important political and cultural contacts .
in prague , he held important political discussions with edu - ard benes , the then czech foreign minister .
he also took a leading part in the formation of the czechoslovak - indian association and addressed its inaugural ceremony in 1934 .
he found a great deal of sympathy for india ' s cause in poland and stimulated the interest of polish friends in india ' s struggle .
he was a great philanthropist , deeply religious and a patron of khadi , swadeshi and national educational institutions .
when two of his sons , sarat and subhas , devoted themselves to congress and national work , he supported them with all his heart .
she dominated the entire domestic scene and ran a large household with exemplary competence .
mahipati was also given the title of ' subuddhi khan ' and presented with a landed ' jaigir ' as a mark of royal recognition .
during one of his visits to rome , subhas chandra had an interesting conversation with mussolini .
the latter asked him whether subhas really and firmly believed that india would soon be free .
mussolini then asked whether he believed in reformist or revolutionary methods for achieving independence .
sub - has answered by saying that he stood for revolutionary methods .
thereupon , mussolini said , " then indeed you have a chance " .
the other country which interested subhas chandra greatly was turkey where fundamental changes had been brought about and the country unified under the leadership of mustafa kemal " ataturk .
he saw that india and turkey had many problems in common and both needed several similar social reforms .
he was particularly interested to see how kemal ataturk modernised an oriental state by inducting technological and military skill from germany .
in the process of his investigations and study , subhas became an ardent admirer of kemal ataturk .
towards the end of 1934 , subhas chandra received news that his father janakinath was critically ill .
the family desired that he should fly to india to be at his father ' s bedside .
he left for india soon but arrived late by a day and a half .
his father had passed away and his last wish was not fulfilled .
as soon as he arrived in calcutta , subhas was interned in his house on elgin road .
during his exile in europe , subhas chandra wrote the first and major part of his substantive work the indian struggle .
he wrote it in a little over a year when his health was far from satisfactory .
while in europe , subhas chandra availed of the opportunity to study the irish experience at close quarters .
on comparative study , subhas discovered and confirmed interestingly similar political trends in the independence movements of ireland and india .
the two leaders met in dublin early in 1936 an ' d held long conversations on a wide range of subjects of mutual interests .
subhas arranged the publication of bulletins on india in three languages , english , french and german , for distribution from ireland to the international press .
the congress socialist party emerged on the national platform in india in 1934 when subhas was in europe .
in outline , subhas chandra said that india ' s party of the future must stand for the interests of the masses and not for the vested interests .
it must stand for the complete political and economic liberation of the indian people .
it will break down social barriers like caste and build a new social structure on the basis of village communities or village " panch " of the past .
the indian movement was essentially a nationalist movementa movement for the national liberation of the indian people .
in 1935 , subhas chandra had to undergo a major surgical operation for the removal of a diseased gallbladder .
his doctors had finally found the root of his ailments .
he wrote on a small sheet of paper : " my assets to my countrymen , my debts to my brother sarat . "
he was greatly disappointed to see that at the league , might prevailed over right and the voice of subject peoples was not heard in its counsels .
of the intellectuals subhas met in europe was remain rolland , the great french savant and friend of india .
after his meeting with subh as chandra , rolland made interesting entries in his diary about an unknown young traveller from a distant forgotten country .
rolland found subhas " particularly serious and pre - occupied and intelligenthe has proved this by the book he has just published .
in early 1936 , subhas chandra felt that he had sufficiently recovered his health and planned to return home .
he was particularly keen to attend the congress session to be held a few months later in lucknow under the presidentship of jawaharlal nehru .
sometime later , he was transferred to kurseong near darjeeling and detained in his brother sarat ' s bungalow there .
the same house had served as the detention camp for sarat chandra himself earlier during the civil disobedience movement .
towards the end of the year , he was removed to calcutta and admitted to the calcutta medical college as a security prisoner .
a series of medical examinations were carried out to determine the cause of the recurrence of his ailments .
the vindictive treatment of subhas chandra was widely condemned throughout the country .
the village still carries the name of subuddhipur .
his honorific title was purandar khan and his ' jaigir ' is still known as purandar - pur , not far from mahinagar .
as purandar and his forbears functioned as ministers for generations , they wielded great influence and prestige as a family .
and because purander was a resident of mahinagar , the place became the nerve centre of the kayasthas of south bengal .
for the purpose of providing pure water for this vast concourse of people , purandar engaged a large number of workers to dig up a large tank .
the workers used to pile up their spades , called kodal in bengali , after their day ' s work at a place adjoining mahinagar .
at this place grew up the village kodalia where janakinath was born and which eventually became the abode of his family .
janakinath and his children including subhas chandra were deeply attached to kodalia .
till the end of his days , janakinath maintained close links with the village and worked for its social upliftment .
subhas chandra returned to india in the last week of january 1938 .
nobody from bengal had been elected president since deshbandhu chitta - ranjan at gaya in 1922 .
the session at haripura was to be the fifty first annual assembly of the congress .
he pointed out that the same principle of partition was present in the new indian constitution introduced in india by the british government .
moreover , britain was no longer the mistress of the seas .
after surveying the international and national scene in his presidential address to the haripura congress , subhas chandra made certain concrete proposals concerning the congress party organisation .
this would pave the way to the building up of a broad anti - imperialist front .
fifthly , he made a strong plea for developing international contacts and an independent foreign policy for india .
in the development of international relations , personal contacts were necessary and indian students abroad could help in this work considerably .
promotion of cultural and educational contacts was another , important means of making india known throughout the world .
subha , s chandra proposed that the indian national congress should appoint its trusted agents in europe , asia , africa and in north , central and south america .
we are therefore fighting not for the cause of india alone but of humanity as well .
as congress president subhas chandra toured the country extensively .
he tackled a ministerial crisis in the central provinces skilfully .
in assam , his personal intervention led to the removal of the muslim league government and its replacement by a congress ministry .
but the negotiations broke down on jinnah ' s insistence that the league must be recognised as the only authoritative and representative organisation of indian muslims .
but the rising generation was in favour of industrialisation for three principal reasons : first , industrialisation was necessary for solving the problem of unemployment .
subhas chandra felt deeply that congressmen must be fully conscious of their responsibility in the matter of achieving national unity and solidarity .
he wanted india to go the way of turkey , not of china .
it is now known that tagore had written to gandhiji supporting subhas chan - dra ' s re - election for the second term as congress president .
and as nehru was already the chairman of the national planning committee , in tagore ' s view , subhas chandra should continue to be the president .
in studies , he was always at the top though he did badly in sports .
when the time came in 1909 to leave the european missionary school , he did so without any regret .
thereafter , when he moved to the ravenshaw collegiate school , a complete mental and psychological change came upon him .
the indian atmosphere which prevailed in the school made him think better of himself and gave him new self - confidence .
but he made good this deficiency by working hard and eventually scoring the highest marks in bengali in the first annual examination .
what is more , he started learning sanskrit with zest .
but sports still remained the neglected area of his activity , a fact which he regretted for the rest of his life .
you have come to absorb varied experience during these years .
today you bring your matured mind and irrepressible vitality to bear upon the work at hand .
in the first half of 1939 , subhas chandra planned a visit to china and asked for a passport from the british authorities which was refused .
meanwhile , a civil disobedience campaign launched by the forward bloc in april 1940 was gathering momentum .
subhas chandra himself organised a campaign for the removal of the hollwell monument in calcutta which was a standing slur on the last independent king of bengal , serajuddoula .
two court cases were also started against him on charges of sedition .
one individual may die for an idea , but that idea , after his death incarnates itself in a thousand lives . . .
" what greater solace can there be than the feeling that one has lived and died for a principle ? . . . .
what higher consummation can life attain than peaceful self - immolation at the alter of one ' s cause ? . . . . . "
subhas chandra started his fast at the end of november 1940 , on the day of kali puja .
initially , the government took a very stiff attitude and did not even care to reply to his ultimatum .
the central government in delhi had already told the bengal government very firmly that subhas chandra must be kept in custody for the duration of the war .
however , after the fast had continued for about a week , the bengal government suddenly got frightened lest their prisoner should die in person .
at a secret meeting of high officials , it was decided to release him with the intention of rearresting him when his health had improved .
the nephew was readily available and subhas drew the young man into the plan .
he started discussing in great detail with sisir the possible methods of escaping from the house in utmost secrecy .
a number of alternative plans were discussed with meticulous care by the uncle and the nephew and finally a reasonable fool - proof one emerged .
sisir was told that one other person , subhas ' s young niece ila would know about his secret departure .
a game of deception would be played at his house saying that subhas chandra had gone into a religious exercise in seclusion for a certain period of time .
meanwhile , in response to a telegraphic message , mian akbar shah had arrived from peshawar .
sisir was introduced to akbar shah and according to subhas ' s instructions , the two of them did some marketing for certain items of his disguise .
mian akbar shah would be in charge of arrangements for subhas ' s journey across the tribal territories through afghanistan .
sarat chandra made certain changes in the overall plan and gave the final touches .
the date of his departure was fixed between subhas chandra and mian akbar shah but it was kept a closely - guarded secret .
his room was curtained off into compartments .
in the ravenshaw collegiate school , there were both oriyas and bengalis among the teachers and students and the relationship among them was extremely cordial .
the same cordiality prevailed in the bose household where a number of oriyas , both hindus and muslims , were in domestic service .
subhas chandra ' s parents were known for their liberality of mind and compassion and they directly influenced the entire family .
thus , sub - has and his generation could never think or feel in . terms of parochialism or provincialism .
of the teachers , the one who left a permanent impression on the youthful mind of subhas , was the headmaster of ravenshaw collegiate school , benimadhab das .
the latter instilled into his pupil ' s growing mind " aesthetic and ethical values " .
the teacher told his pupil that in human life moral values counted for more than anything else .
he asked him to surrender himself completely to nature and let nature speak to him .
subhas chandra was around fifteen years old when he entered one of the stormiest periods in his mental and psychical life .
when most members of the family had retired to their rooms , subhas chandra made final preparations to leave .
it had since been arranged that two other nephews residing in the same house would assist ila in carrying out the deception story of seclusion .
sisir arrived around 9 p . m .
although , the government was compelled to release subhas unconditionally , he was very closely watched day and night .
thus , he was aware of what the police department knew about him and from what sources .
the two travellers had a thrilling drive up the grand trunk road in bright moonlight .
sarat chandra ' s eldest son asoke lived at barari with his family .
he alerted his brother about the impending arrival of their uncle in disguise .
subhas chandra arrived some time later alone and introduced himself as an insurance agent on business .
a mock drama was enacted in the presence and within the hearing of asoke ' s domestic servants .
all conversation was in english and asoke even formally introduced sisir to the stranger .
apparently , at the visitor ' s request he was allowed to stay in the guestroom for the day .
subhas chandra personally purchased his ticket , boarded a first - class compartment and was on his way .
the arrangement was that subhas would take the frontier mail from delhi and arrive at peshawar on 19th january 1941 .
he asked the tonga walla to take him to the dean ' s hotel while he followed in another tonga .
on the way , they changed their mind and took him to taj mahal hotel .
akbar shah was walking back through the peshawar city when he met an old trusted friend abad khan whom he took into confidence .
abad khan had long previous experience of such secret journeys .
they looked for a serai and were guided to one near the lahori gate .
for food , they had bread dipped in sweet tea .
in kabul , subhas chandra carried on his deaf and dumb show in the serai near lahori gate .
even after subhas chandra had parted with his gold wristwatch to satisfy him , he returned again and again and insisted upon taking the two strangers to the kotwali .
both subhas chandra and bhagat ram felt that it was becoming too risky to stay on in the serai .
it took nearly four weeks to obtain a positive answer from the soviet side .
another transformation in his disguise was to take place from being a deaf and dumb pathan to an italian diplomat .
on the 17th march , subhas chandra shifted to the private residence of crescini of the italian legation .
next morning , subhas chandra left in a car for the soviet frontier accompanied by three germans .
they crossed the oxus at the afghan frontier post and drove along until they reached samarkhand .
the conflict was between the natural attraction of worldly life , worldly pursuits and mundane physical desires and his higher self trying to assert itself .
it was at this point , when he was barely fifteen , that swami vivekananda entered his life .
he had by a chance of circumstance stumbled upon the swami ' s works .
he devoured them avidly and a mental revolution took place .
he found what he was groping for , a central principle on which he could hang his whole life .
subhas accepted the modern interpretation given to the ancient scriptures by the swami that faith and strength alone could lead to salvation .
from vivekananda , subhas turned to his master ramakrishna paramhansa , the essence of whose teachings was that only through renunciation was realistion or salvation possible .
subhas chandra was also accorded the appellation of " netaji " which combined a sense of both affection and honour .
subhas chandra started broadcasting to india in february 1942 soon after the fall of singapore .
he told his countrymen in his first broadcast : " the hour of india ' s salvation is at hand .
india will now rise and break the chains of servitude that have bound her so long .
through india ' s liberation will asia and the world move forward towards the larger goal of human emancipation " .
the indian legion was an entirely volunteer army .
they were recruited on the basis of patriotic inspiration and education often conducted by netaji himself among indian war prisoners .
two days later , he spoke for the last time to the indian legion .
before launching upon his second adventure into the unknown , netaji left a poignant message in his own hand a letter in bengali to his brother sarat .
while it was still dark on the 9th february , netaji and hasan were welcomed aboard the submarine by its commander musenberg .
as soon as the two of them entered the vessel , the doors closed and it disappeared under the sea .
netaji had his berth in a recess along a passage .
even the food was stinking of diesel oil .
netaji had to spend three months in such an environment .
the submarine first went through danish waters , then through the small belt to the norwegian coast and north sea and finally reached the atlantic ocean .
he accepted this condition without any hesitation .
even under the most trying living conditions in the submarine , netaji did not rest even for a day .
from the first day , he started his work on the many plans he had for the coming struggle in east asia .
and all this had to be done , as was his habit , with thoroughness and to the minutest detail .
as a desperate measure , two men jumped into the sea from the german submarine and swam to the japanese .
signalling between the boats then went on by show of hands , but the sea continued to be rough .
at sabang , netaji and hasan were quarantined and rested for a few days and then flown to tokyo where they arrived on 13th may 1943 .
they were put up at the well - known imperial hotel .
he met leading personalities of all branches of japan ' s armed forces , important political and diplomatic personnel , intellectuals and public men of standing .
in november 1943 , netaji attended the assembly of greater east asiatic nations in tokyo .
nevertheless , he completely dominated the conference by the sheer force of his personality , robust independence , sincerity and oratory .
before finally returning to singapore in december , netaji toured china , philippines and indonesia . everywhere he was received with the honour due to a head of state .
in china , he took the opportunity of visiting the mausoleum of sun - yat - sen near nanking and offering his homage to the father of chinese revolution .
on the 29th december 1943 , netaji subhas chandra bose arrived in andaman islands to take charge of the first territory of the provisional government of azad hind .
as head of state , he unfurled the national tricolour in the presence of a massive gathering on gymkhana grounds .
he likened the liberation of andaman to the fall of bastille during the french revolution .
he visited the notorious cellular jail where the british had imprisoned and tortured hundreds of india ' s freedom fighters .
during his stay in andaman , netaji and his party occupied the former british chief commissioner ' s residence on ross island over which the national tricolour fluttered proudly .
this proved great encouragement to netaji and all ranks in the ina , and created confidence in the japanese command about the fighting capabilities of the army .
the indo - japanese forces advanced rapidly on all the three sectors of the wide front .
in the last week of april , they were already within ten miles of imphal in a remarkable encircling movement .
the road to delhi is the road to freedom !
chalo delhi ! "
in the first week of april , netaji appointed a . c . chatterjee , a member of his cabinet , as the governor - designate of liberated territories .
the azad hind dal , the administrative wing of the provisional government , was ready to move forward with the fauj to take over the administration of freed areas .
he also concluded at this time the indo - japanese loan agreement without any strings and with the assurance of full repayment .
he also made a large donation to the government of thailand for the facilities offered to the azad hind fauj .
by the time netaji returned to rangoon at the end of november 1944 , the military situation had deteriorated much further .
there was continuous bombardment from the air by enemy planes and on the ground .
the first division of the i . n . a . commanded by kiani on the irrawa - dy front was in great danger .
the japanese were compelled to comply . thereupon , netaji accompanied by the ranis and his personal staff moved out of rangoon in the direction of bangkok .
he had , therefore , to march miles and miles in the company of the brave women soldiers and his personal staff .
there are many more rounds to fight . . . .
" i have to leave burma in order to continue the struggle for india ' s liberation . . . .
my unshakable faith in india ' s early emancipation remains unimpaired . "
after leaving saigon , they spent a night in tourane in north indo - china .
on the 18th august , they flew in the same plane to taiwan en route to tokyo via dairen in manchuria .
it was further reported that netaji passed away the same night at the military hospital at taihoku .
many in india still do not accept the report of his death to be authentic .
during the war in burma and particularly after the fall of rangoon , news had been trickling through to india about the exploits of the azad hind fauj .
such declarations set the tone and the temper of the indian people in regard to netaji and the ina .
when the second world war ended in 1945 , the indian independence movement was at its lowest ebb .
after the defeat of the august rebellion and the azad hind crusade , a sense of frustration and despondency had gripped the nationalist forces .
thus , in the beginning of 1946 - as netaji had rightly predicted - the post - war upsurge had brought the indian nation to the threshold of freedom .
it was in the vedic age that the conception of rita , the existence of an order in nature , developed .
this , in turn , led to the establishment of a social and political order culminating in the development of law for regulating human relations .
it was through the state that justice could be dispensed to the people and dispensing justice thus became the most important duty of the ancient indian king .
the conception of state and the judicial system are intimately linked : it was the state that implemented law and gave impartial justice to the people .
in the pre - mauryan stage , it is possible to determine the true state of law as the vedic and dharmasutra periods .
they also increased the judicial powers of the king .
there were people ' s courts which had the power to decide disputes at village level .
the qualifications of judges and other officers of the court were prescribed .
laws of procedure and of evidence were laid down .
popular tribunals , particularly the village courts , survived for a long time and existed even at the time british rule began in india .
their continuance was favoured by their antiquity as there were practically no other effective tribunals within easy reach .
the principal functions discharged by such tribunals were conciliatory and local rulers did not usually interfere in their working .
the king was invested with the power to pass final decrees .
the chief justice had to give his final opinion on cases , and the duty of the judges was to investigate the merits of each case .
it was the responsibility of the bailiff ( swapurusha ) to ensure the attendance of the defendant , the assessors and the witnesses .
the smritis furnish the basis for passing a decree .
gold and fire were kept for purposes of administering oaths .
katyayana adds a few more criteria to indicate the suitability of a person to be appointed as a judee :
detection of youths of criminal tendency ;
vi seizure of criminals on suspicion ;
vii examination of sudden deaths ;
viii cases of sexual intercourse with immoral women ;
ix punishments for violating justice ; and x trials of torture in instances of illicit confession .
another point to note is that kautilya always speaks of a bench of judges , not a court presided over by a single judge .
the mauryan judicial system continued unchanged till the death of bindusara .
but during the reign of ashoka , significant administrative changes were introduced which involved the appointment of new officers as well as extension of their duties .
such officers were known as rajjukas , mahamatras and the pradesikan .
the responsibilities of rajjukas increased as they were entrusted with the executive and judicial powers .
from the pillar edict iv of ashoka it is known that criminal offences involved arrest , imprisonment and death sentences as punishment .
according to hiuen tsang , in his early career ashoka was a cruel ruler who had constructed a jail that was called hell .
the edicts bear witness to the rigour of the early judicial system of the emperor .
the rock edict i of dhauli refers to some aspects of the judiciary under ashoka .
finally , in the summer vacation of 1914 , he quietly left home with a friend without telling anybody .
they toured various places of pilgrimage in upper india , places of historical interest and also traditional educational institutions .
what disillusioned him was that in most of these places superstition and meaningless rituals rather than the basic tenets of hindu religion were the order of the day .
what shocked young subhas was the casteism and sectarianism practised by protagonists of religion at such holy places .
in the course of his tour , he met swami brahmananda at the ramakrishna mission at benares who knew the family quite well .
a few days later , he was down in bed with typhoid fever .
the kings had all powers of original and appellate jurisdiction and in all types of cases , whether civil or criminal .
even if both parties belonged to the army , they could take their cases to a civil court which had precedence over the military court .
this is quite different today .
panchayat courts were not under the control of any qazi , governor or district officer .
panchayat members were elected by the people .
they were empowered to impose fines , public degradation , reprimands or excommunication , but they could not pass a sentence of imprisonment or death .
public opinion was the major sanction behind their authority .
the administration of justice by panchayats was appreciated by early british administrators in india .
sir henry elliot in this regard ; prior to the enactment of the indian penal code in 1861 , observed :
the rule during akbar ' s regime was that the judges must try to find out the facts of a case by every possible means .
statements of witnesses alone were not regarded as sufficient .
judges were expected to make thorough interrogations of the parties concerned and were further expected to give considerable thought to the case before pronouncing any judgement .
as he lay in bed , the first world war broke out .
they exhibited racial arrogance and superiority in the streets , in railway trains , in public transport , etc .
but very unfortunately , the principal declined to withdraw the penal measure he had imposed on the students in the shape of a fine .
the same professor again manhandled a student of first year class .
the government closed the college immediately and set up an enquiry committee to go into the continued disturbances in that institution .
manucci also gives an account of the emperor administering justice :
the king holds public audience in the amkhas , and there it is usual for aggrieved persons to appear and make complaint .
some men demand punishment for murderers , others complain of injustice and violence
characteristics of mughal justice mughal justice , especially in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , was quick , inexpensive and largely based on facts .
the year 1765 marked the commencement of the east india company ' s territorial sovereignty .
clive succeeded in obtaining from emperor shah alam the grant of the diwani or fiscal administration of bengal , bihar and cdssa .
the principal criminal courts were of the nawab and his deputy , and of the faujdars .
in the confusion , the principal fell out with the government and was placed under suspension .
the governing body confirmed the principal ' s order and expelled him from the college .
he appealed to the university for permission to study in some other college but was refused .
he was , thus , virtually rusticated from the university .
the enquiry committee consisted of three britishers and two indians , ashutosh mookerjea and heramba chandra moitra .
he made a reasoned and forthright statement and said that although he could not justify the assault , he knew that students had acted under great provocation .
he narrated in detail the misdeeds of the britishers in presidency college .
the recorders ' s courts at madras and bombay were replaced by supreme courts in 1801 and 1823 respectively .
the courts of request also were superseded by the establishment of small cause courts in 1850 .
these regulations had the effect of separation of the executive and legislative from the judicial authority of the state .
there existed at this time five classes of provincial civil courts :
powered by a regulation of 1793 to decide civil suits of the value not exceeding rs 50 .
ii register courts , empowered to try causes for amounts not exceeding rs 200 , when authorised by the judges .
in 1818 the right of appeal was extended to the judgements of the sudder courts at madras and bombay .
tained by the charters of the high courts in subsequent years .
under the act of 1883 four members formed the quorum but by a later act this number was reduced to three .
the moffussil courts administered hindu and mohamedan laws amended and supplemented by indian legislation and , generally speak - ing , had no jurisdiction over the europeans .
the family , therefore , thought it prudent to send subhas back to cuttack where , they thought , there was comparative safety .
strangely , some members of the group with whom he worked thought he had gone too far .
but he stood firm , determined to face the consequences .
the draft was completed in 1838 but it was not till 1860 that it was passed into law .
the first edition of the code of civil procedure was passed in 1859 , followed by the code of criminal procedure in 1861 .
substantially , the entire criminal law of india was codified , but the codification of civil laws was far from complete .
there were three difficulties which stood in the way of codification of hindu and mohamedan laws .
every province was to be divided into sessions divisions and there was to be a court of sessions and a sessions judge for every such division .
magistrates of all the three classes were to be appointed by the local government and acted in subordination to the magistrate of the district .
the local government could divide a district into divisions and place a magistrate of the first or second class in charge of a division .
the divisional magistrate was subject to the control of the magistrate of the district , but he , in turn , controlled the magistrates in his division .
however , there is an exception with regard to :
i foreign sovereigns ;
ii ambassadors and members of the diplomatic corps enjoying immunity ;
iii alien enemies ;
v warships ; and vi the president and the governor under article 361 of the constitution .
the indian penal code lists various offences under various heads , for example :
the criminal procedure code is mainly an objective law of procedure .
its object is to provide machinery for punishment of offences against substantive criminal law , for example , the indian penal code .
in fact , this code is to be read together with the indian evidence act .
the machinery provided in the code is also the same for local offences under acts other than the ipc .
the code however is not merely proce - dural law .
some of the important areas covered by the criminal procedure code are :
i constitution of criminal courts and offices ;
criminal offences are assigned to a different hierar - chy of courts according to the nature of the offence and the power of the court to award sentences .
in every district in a state , the high court appoints a judicial magistrate of the first class who is called the chief judicial magistrate .
the high court can also appoint more judicial magistrates of the first class , who are designated as additional chief judicial magistrates .
they have the power of the chief judicial magistrate .
these additional chief judicial mag - istrates can exercise jurisdiction in the areas allotted to them .
i while judicial magistrates are appointed by the high court , executive magistrates are appointed by the state in consultation with the high court .
however , any order made by an executive magistrate is subject to the revisional jurisdiction of the high court or a sessions judge .
the powers which are conferred on executive magistrates under the new code are administrative andare , at best , quasi - judicial .
there are the following classes of public prosecutors :
ii public prosecutors appointed by the state govern -
iii additional public prosecutors appointed by the state or central government .
iv special public prosecutors appointed by the central government .
v special public prosecutors appointed by state gov - ernment for special cases and for a particular time .
the salary and all other allowances are paid by the central and / or state governments .
the criminal procedure code lays down the qualifications , the manner and method of appointing such prosecutors .
in theory he / she stands for the state in whose name all proceedings are conducted .
their object should be to aid the court to arrive at the truth .
the ideal public prosecutor is not concerned with securing convictions or with satisfying departments of the government which he / she represents .
rather , they are agents of justice .
there should be , on their part , no unseeming eagerness to grasp at convictions .
the high court is the highest in every state for the adjudication of disputes .
high courts have civil / criminal , original and appellate jurisdiction .
there is a three - tier system of civil courts in every state .
in actual fact , they constitute one class although the amount in dipsute over which they have jurisdiction differs .
all courts in the states are subordinate to the high court and the district court is the highest court in every district .
the district judge / additional district judge and the subordinate judge of the first class have the jurisdiction to hear suits without any limit as to their value .
for the purposes of jurisdiction , this is calculated in accordance with the provisions of the suits valuation act and its rules .
the proceedings under the indian divorce act , the succession act , etc . can be filed only in district courts .
these values are fixed by the state government from time to time . '
the district judge exercises administrative control over all civil courts within the local limits of his jurisdiction .
the evidence is either recorded verbatim or in a summary form depending on the kind of proceeding .
normally , the evidence is taken down in shorthand if this facility is available , otherwise in longhand .
it is usually recorded in the language of the witness but is sometimes recorded in a translated form either in english or the language of the local court .
the judgement is recorded by giving findings on each issue and ultimately the conclusion is recorded which is called a ' decree ' .
the court premises is by law a public place entitling any member of the public to sit and observe the proceedings in an orderly and disciplined manner .
it meant a break with the past and surging forward .
he set sail for england on the 15th september , 1919 .
when subhas chandra left for england , he knew that he would get barely eight months to prepare for the indian civil service examination .
moreover , because of his age that would be his first and last chance .
however , the civil service examination being so near , he devoted practically his whole time to preparing for that .
there is another important jurisdiction of the supreme court , namely entertainment of writs under article 32 for the protection of fundamental rights .
the primary task of the supreme court is appellate .
in that capacity it serves as final arbiter in the construction of the constitutional provisions and it provides uniform interpretation of law .
it has complete power to do so .
however , it attempts to adhere to precedent known as stare decisis .
appeals come to the supreme court from various sources , that is , from high courts and tribunals , special tribunals , etc .
however , article 136 empowers the supreme court to entertain special leave petitions from any order or judgement of any court , tribunal or authority .
once a decision is given , it becomes final ; but the supreme court does have the power to review its own decisions .
the procedure is provided in order xl of the supreme court rules , 1966 .
english translations of all the documents are required to be submitted .
the supreme court has made rules regarding the translation of the documents to be relied upon in any proceedings before the court .
the seat of the supreme court is delhi and the proceedings are open to the public .
except for the chamber judge who sits singly , all matters are heard by benches of two or more judges .
enforcement of fundamental rights the constitution of india , part iii , has guaranteed fundamental rights to all citizens and persons within this country .
the guarantee of fundamental rights would have been meaningless without an accompanying guaranteed remedy for their protection .
the framers of the constitution have made such a provision in article 32 and the supreme court of india has been made the custodian of fundamental rights .
the scope of the jurisdiction of the court under the article is very wide .
jurisdiction conferred upon the supreme court by article 32 is an important and integral part of the basic structure of the constitution .
it is found to be slow , expensive , inexpert , complex and formalistic .
it is not compulsary for such tribunals to be bound by strict rules of evidence and procedure .
they can take a practical view of the matter to decide even specialised and complex problems with expert knowledge .
iii many of the disputed questions are technical in nature .
iv such tribunals do their work more expeditiously , inexpensively and efficiently than ordinary courts , as they possess greater technical knowledge .
the object of enacting the administrative tribunal act was :
i to relieve congestion in the courts and ii to provide for speedier disposal of disputes relating to service matters than can be done in the courts .
the tribunal is not bound by the procedure laid down in the civil procedure code 1908 , but is guided by the principles of natural justice .
it can punish for contempt under the contempt of court act 1971 .
the jurisdiction of the supreme court under articles 32 is not affected .
the commission consists of a chairman and other members appointed by the central government .
apart from the chairman the commission should have at least five members .
the commission ' s primary image is as a consumer protection body .
this is partly historical .
this does not , however , affect the scope and jurisdiction of the mrtp commission .
a the commission has been granted powers to issue temporary injunctions against companies indulging in restrictive trade practices .
it is , however , the only court where a case of a military offence can be tried , determined and punished .
the general court martial has powers to try any army persons subject to the acts for any offence punishable therein and award " any sentence .
among the political parties , only the labourites expressed sympathy for indian aspirations .
but , regardless of the lack of political rapport , even subhas could count among his friends britishers holding conservative views .
the matter was passed back and forth between the india office and the war office , the one blaming the other for objecting to the enlistment of the indians .
subhas took a leading part in representing their case before the under - secretary of state for india .
the crux of the matter was that members of the officers ' training corps once qualified would be entitled to commissions in the british army .
the life that subhas led in england appeared to his peers to be puritanic .
under various cooperative societies acts states cooperative appellate courts and tribunals have been constituted in almost all states .
the cooperative courts have jurisdiction over the respective state or any part thereof .
if any party is aggrieved by any decision or order of the cooperative court or the registrar , the appeal lies to the cooperative appellate court .
nor can the conditions of service of the election commissioner be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment .
ii an order of the commission can be challenged before the supreme court under article 32 where it involves the question of the constitutional validity of such an order .
the procedure adopted by these courts was provided in the code of civil procedure and the criminal procedure code respectively .
this was cumber - some and the courts did not have the power under law to investigate on their own .
such litigation , therefore , often took a long time to reach final determination .
it was to provide effective and less expensive reme - dies that family courts were established under the family courts act 1984 .
the act confers powers upon the court to use its discretion and bring about and effect amicable settlement between the parties .
generally , in most cases , family courts dispense with representation by lawyers .
the judge can , in due course , bring about speedy justice and conciliation .
the foreign exchange appellate board has been established as provided in section 52 of the foreign exchange regulation act 1973 .
the powers and functions of the board may be exercised by the chairman and one other member or by a bench of two members constituted by the chairman .
the board also has powers for revision .
an appeal challenging the findings of fact or en - hancement or reduction of fine or penalty is not provided .
such a forfeiture is to be ordered by the competent authority appointed by the central government under the act .
the said tribunal comprises a chairman and such number of other members as the central government thinks fit .
currently , the tribunal consists of the chairman and two other members .
the chairman should be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the supreme court or of a high court .
no fees is to be paid for filing the appeal to this tribunal .
the hearings before the tribuaal are not open to the public .
during the hearing , the appellant can be represented by his or her authorised representative , who can be a company secretary , a chartered accountant or an advocate .
the tribunal has the powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the code of civil procedure 1908 .
the income - tax appellate tribunal is presently consti - tuted under the income - tax act 1961 .
the chairman of the tribunal is ordinarily appointed from among the judicial members .
the tribunal sits in benches in various cities , such as ahmedabad , allahabad / bombay , calcutta , delhi , madras , etc .
the tribunal decides the matter only after giving both parties to the appeal an opportunity of being heard .
if the parties do not appear at the time of the hearing , the appeal may be adjourned or heard ex parte .
the tribunal may also take appropriate actions for its contempt .
the power of staying recovery proceeding pending an appeal can also be exercised by the tribunal as being incidental or ancillary to its appellate jurisdiction .
the decisions of the tribunal on questions of fact are final .
an aggrieved party can also invoke the jurisdiction of the supreme court under article 136 of the constitution against any order .
the industrial tribunal may consist of one or more members who are appointed by the central government or by the appropriate government as the case may be .
where such a tribunal consists of two or more members , one of them will be appointed as the chairman of the tribunal .
there can be a one - man tribunal also .
the procedure to be followed by the industrial tribunal is prescribed by the act and the rules made thereunder .
the tribunal has to act judicially as it is a quasi - judicial authority .
it has to apply the law and also the principles of justice , equity and good conscience .
every member of the tribunal is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of section 21 of the penal code .
the tribunal ' s awards are published in the government gazette .
on due publication , the award becomes final .
if it is not signed by all members , it becomes illegal and inoperative .
the tribunal is also subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under article 227 of the constitution .
the indian railway rates tribunal was established under the indian railways act 1989 .
the report filed by a police officer before the claims tribunal can also be treated as a claim filed on behalf of the accidented person .
the claim should be filed in the application form as provided in the rules framed under the act .
appeals appeals from the award of the tribunal can be made to the high court within 90 days from the date of the award .
there can be no appeal if the compensation amount awarded is less than rs 10,000 .
having studied the original sources of continental history , subhas chandra acquired a proper and new appreciation of the inner currents of international politics .
this stood him in good stead in later life .
the indian civil service open competitive examination started early in july 1920 and dragged on for a month .
he was greatly surprised when late one night in mid - september , he received a telegram from a friend congratulating him on his success .
next morning , he found his name in the newspapers in the list of successful candidates for the indian civil service .
he had come fourth in order of merit .
the mark - sheet later revealed that he came first in english composition .
ironically , subhas ' s success at the civil service examination brought him face to face with the greatest crisis of his life .
at other times honest people fear arbitration more than they do law suits .
the scheme of the act is to provide a domestic forum for speedy and substantial justice unhampered by legal technicalities .
almost all matters in dispute that are not of a criminal nature can be referred to arbitration .
there cannot be an oral agreement or reference to arbitration .
the parties can go in for sole arbitration or each party appointing an arbitrator .
if the parties accept the award it becomes the rule of the court and that is the end of the dispute .
however , there are limited grounds on which the award can be challenged .
the arbitrators ' fees and other expenses are paid by the parties .
the lok adalats have since received statutory status under an enactment of the parliament called the legal services authorities act 1987 .
this composite act covers legal aid , lok adalats and legal assistance services .
in most cases , an individual cannot afford proper legal services whereas corporations can retain the services of some of the best legal practitioners .
sometimes other court expenses are so heavy that they constrain an individual litigant .
it was against this backdrop that the act providing for the formation of lok adalats was passed .
in vedic india , an autonomous village community was a special feature of the social fabric of society .
a panchayat was constituted of elected members and its head was appointed by election from among them .
the institution of the panchayat continued to enjoy autonomy until it was destroyed during the time of the turkish and afghan invasions .
by the time british rule came to be established in india , panchayats had more or less lost their importance and identity .
in 1882 , lord ripon established local self - government in india with the setting up of district local boards .
the district boards and district councils were established in marathwada and vidarbha .
under this act , the panchayat was constituted into an elected body .
members were elected by adult male villagers and the panchayat was entrusted with local functions , mainly of a civil nature .
panchayats were empowered to collect compulsory house taxes .
after independence , the process of decentralisation continued to be in operation .
in bihar , the panchayat raj act was enacted in 1948 and in rajasthan , the panchayat act was introduced in the year 1953 .
after the reorganisation of states in 1956 , laws to introduce the panchayat system in different states were gradually enacted .
the bombay village panchayats act was enacted in 1958 .
finally , he wrote to deshbandhu that the congress must have a determined policy as to the future constitution of india .
he , therefore , emphasized that they must proceed to frame the new constitution of india on the basis of swaraj .
sttbhas ' s resignation from the indian civil service created a sensation among the indian community in england .
the news also travelled fast to india and the subject became one of the excited discussions throughout the country .
the die was cast .
subhas chandra bose set his face irrevocably against any compromise with expediency and opted for the path of idealism and moral action .
in september 1921 , the congress working committee met in calcutta at deshbandhu ' s residence .
contrary to widely - held belief , subhas got the impression that tagore was not fundamentally opposed to the concept of non - cooperation but had important reservations .
when the annual conference of the party was held in calcutta in august , there was a large attendance and great enthusiasm .
the british government could no longer wait and watch as the swaraj party went on scoring success after success .
on meeting subhas , he said , " mr . bose , i have a warrant for your arrest under the regulation iii of 1818 . "
among those arrested with subhas chandra were two prominent swarajist members of the bengal council .
the british government justified the large - scale arrests in bengal in october 1924 on the plea that a revolutionary conspiracy was afoot .
two anglo - indian newspapers of calcutta went further to allege that subhas chandra bose was " the brain of the revolutionary conspiracy . "
they had to face legal proceedings for defamation on subhas chan - dra ' s behalf on this account .
after a voyage of four days , the state prisoners were landed in rangoon .
a full day ' s journey by train under strong armed police guard brought them to mandalay .
the second phase of this preparation for his future role in india took place inside the prison walls of burma .
what is more , he made a deep study of burmese history , politics and people .
in october 1925 , subhas chandra and his fellow prisoners demanded facilities and funds to perform durga puja in jail .
although the superintendent of the jail accorded permission in anticipation of government sanction , the latter refused .
thereupon , subhas and his co - prisoners went on hunger strike in february 1926 .
it was at this point towards the end of 1927 that subhas was elected president of the bengal provincial congress committee .
they wanted to dispose of the indian question before a labour government came into power .
the indian national congress reacted sharply to the appointment of the simon commission .
it was , therefore , natural that the congress decided , without any hesitation and without losing any time , to declare its boycott of the simon commission .
in 1926 , there was much of inter - communal tensions and strifes in india .
the trend , however , changed for the better .
the annual session of the indian national congress of 1928 was held in calcutta under the presidentship of pandit motilal nehru .
the attendance at this session was the largest since the inception of the congress and all arrangements were made on a colossal scale .
subhas chandra bose emerged at this session as the principal spokesman of the younger and leftist forces in the national movement .
when the general officer commanding in full military uniform inspected the parade of the volunteers , it was a magnificent spectacle .
subhas chandra , thus , introduced - a new element in the national movement , viz . , military discipline among national workers .
what was in 1928 merely a vision came true in practical shape and form on the battlefields of south - east asia during world war ii .
at the congress session , a cleavage appeared between the elders and the young leaders of the party over the main political resolution .
even though pandit motilal nehru had , a couple of months earlier , encouraged the bengal congress to fight the elections , he supported the move .
they demanded that in a real round table conference , india ' s representatives must not be selected by the british government but by the indian people .
the committee also issued a manifesto in the form of a declaration and a pledge on indian independence .
at the karachi session of the nawjawan bharat sabha , he spelt out in clear and forthright terms the ultimate objective and the means leading to that goal .
the independence day was observed in january in many places with great enthusiasm .
the british government published a white paper in the middle of march embodying its proposals for constitutional reforms .
soon thereafter , the annual session of the congress was called in calcutta for april .
the government immediately arrested all the leaders who were still at liberty including the president - elect madan mohan malavi - ya .
the most important resolution of the congress was the one condemning and rejecting the white paper .
nevertheless , the country was startled one morning in may to hear that the mahatma had suspended the civil disobedience movement .
they called for a more radical policy and leadership .
the book was published in london in january 1935 .
the diplomatic correspondent of the daily herald expressed the following opinion : " it is calm , sane , dispassionate .
in rome , subhas personally presented a copy to mussolini who , in turn , expressed his sympathy for the indian freedom movement .
of all the european countries , ireland was the one most interested in indian independence .
conversely indian nationalists , particularly bengal revolutionaries had been greatly ' inspired by the irish struggle against the common enemy .
it was here that in about ten days , he wrote his unfinished autobiography an indian pilgrim .
he wrote ten chapters bringing the narrative of his life upto his resignation from the indian civil service in england in 1921 .
unfortunately owing to the stress and strain of his hectic public life that followed soon thereafter , he never finished his autobiography .
before returning home , subhas chandra visited london in january 1938 .
while he was there , came his formal elections as congress president .
of particular significance were his two meetings with eamon de valera of ireland who was then conducting delicate negotiations with the british on behalf of the irish free state .
the emergence of air force as a new factor in world history also posed a new challenge to the empire .
the rashtrapati declared with confidence that amid this interplay of world forces , india emerged much stronger than she had been ever before .
talking of indian unity , subhas said that the time was opportune for the final solution of this problem , consistent with the fundamental principles of nationalism .
he said that only by emphasising our common interests , economic and political , could ' we ' cut across communal dissensions .
he categorically denied that congress ' s method was one of passive resistance . satyagraha , to him , was not merely passive resistance but active resistance as well .
subhas chandra clarified without any shadow of a doubt his conception of the role of the congress in the history of india ' s national struggle .
he declared that the party that won freedom for india should also be the party that would put into effect the entire programme of post - war reconstruction .
this idea is based on the similarity of names .
tri tantri in sanskrit has an identical connotation : tri means ' three ' and tantri ' strings ' .
it has a wide or narrow bridge and seven strings .
in conclusion , he referred to the necessity of adequate preparations for making contry ' s final advance in the direction of swaraj .
the mental agony that subhas chandra experienced at tripuri made his recovery all the more difficult .
an anti - imperialist conference was held at nagpur in october 1939 .
the present age is the anti - imperialist phase of our movement .
our main task in this age is to end imperialism and win national independence for the indian people .
when freedom comes the age of national reconstruction will commence and that will be the socialist phase of our movement . "
subhas chandra started a weekly journal , forward bloc in august 1939 of which he was the editor .
he wrote a series of signed editorials in the journal week after week .
his deputy was alexander werth who had qualified as a barrister in england and had deep and sympathetic interest in indian affairs .
these two men became close friends of subhas , sympathised fully with his aspirations and tried their best to promote his cause in every possible way .
an increasing number of indian exiles had been drifting into germany and a large number of indian war prisoners from north africa were also being brought to germany .
they realised that he possessed an extraordinarily strong will and that his sincerity and integrity were beyond question .
when germany attacked soviet russia at the end of june 1941 , subhas chandra was in rome .
netaji immediately started thinking in terms of coming over to the east and organising an armed thrust into india from the east .
what is more , to subhas chandra ' s satisfaction , mahatma gandhi was moving in the direction of a final struggle with the british .
if india were free the first step would probably be to negotiate with japan " .
netaji met adolf hitler for the first and the last time at the end of may 1942 .
this was the first and only declaration of its kind by the plead of state of a foreign power during world war ii .
having won the first round , netaji disclosed his presence in japan to the world .
but it is not possible for our countrymen at home to organise an armed revolution and to fight the british army of occupation with modern arms .
this is a task which must therefore devolve on indians living abroad and particularly on indians living in east asia , . . . .
thus , for the first time in two hundred years , india ' s freedom fighters tasted independent statehood .
the proclamation of the azad hind government is a memorable document in the history of india ' s freedom struggle .
netaji wrote it sitting through one whole night sipping cups of coffee .
after proclaiming the government , netaji took the oath as the head of state and prime minister .
the moment was so emotionally charged that he broke down and tears rolled down his cheeks .
on the 22nd october 1943 , netaji formally inaugurated the rani of jhansi regiment of the azad hind fauj .
but eventually , they were compelled to retreat .
there were occasions when he himself ran the risk of being encircled or of being killed in action .
on the 6th july 1944 , netaji addressed a radio appeal to mahatma gandhi over the rangoon radio .
in the broadcast , he traced the contemporary history of india ' s struggle underlining the great role played by gandhiji in that history .
then he gave his own analysis of the international situation with particular reference to the intentions and policies of the british imperialists with regard to india .
he told gandhiji : " i am honestly convinced that the british government will never recognise india ' s demand for inde - pendence " .
on the other hand , netaji said , the war aims of america were to dominate the world and create the american century .
japan ' s fate was sealed and she unconditionally surrendered to the allies on the 14th august 1945 .
the news of japan ' s surrender was conveyed to netaji while he was watching a cultural performance by the rani of jhansi regiment .
in the history of india ' s struggle for freedom , netaji sub - has chandra bose stands out in all distinctiveness .
when he was born , the surging tide of bengal renaissance had reached its high water mark .
as a mere boy in an english missionary school , he found the environment foreign to his nature and thus became already a rebel at heart .
this was the situation even after 1939 when the world went up in flames and empires began to crumble .
although , he believed that india was ripe for revolution , the rest of the national leadership thought otherwise .
therefore , the possibility of starving the british fortress into submission by a total mass satyagraha was out of the question .
he joined presidency college , the premier college of calcutta university in 1913 .
before the college opened , he lost no time in establishing contact with the idealistic group , an emissary of which had met him at cuttack a year ago .
in calcutta , he learnt that social service was an integral part of yoga and it encompassed national reconstruction on modern lines .
the leader who captured their imagination at the time was aurobindo ghose .
his close associate lokmanya bal gangadhar tilak also commanded great prestige .
only in exceptional cases could he depute or authorise the chief justice to preside over the court .
on the whole , ancient indian law and legal proce - dure , beginning with the vedic age and ending with the middle ages , was fairly developed .
we also learn that some court fees were payable to the king by the parties in some cases .
it may be noted that gautama has a clause similar to kautilya ' s about the period of adjournment allowable to the parties to the suit .
islamic jurisprudence is derived mainly from the qur ' an and the sunnah ( the practices and traditions of the prophet ) .
even zimmis ( non - believers ) could be judges in such courts .
the above courts dealt with cases of common law and political offences .
the classification was not very strict ; in the seventeenth century the qazi heard all cases civil , criminal , religious and secular .
this is clear from the cases found in the akhabararrat ( provincial ) of ajmer of the 46th year of aurangzeb ' s reign , discovered in the deccan .
the jurisdiction of the court was not limited .
cases were not classified for jurisdiction according to either the seriousness of the offence or the value of the property involved .
no two courts could be called mutually exclusive , either on the basis of territory or the amount of the claim .
it was however possible that a higher court could send a case to the lower court .
similarly , there were no graded appellate courts .
decisions given by a higher court in a particular case did not necessarily constitute a precedent for the lower court , as is the position today .
the judges of courts were learned men and each had an individuality of his own .
the village elders had enough commonsense to decide cases , and it was because of this that the bulk of cases were decided by caste courts and panchayats .
the mughal judges had to perform the duties of policemen too .
courts in a capital the emperor ' s court was the supreme court of the empire .
the sadr - us - sadr , chief sadr and diwan ala were appointed by the king .
no mir adils are traceable in qasbas , parganas and sarkars , because there was not much litigation .
the diwan ' s court was one of appeal only .
they were empowered to impose fines , public degradation , reprimands or excommunication , but they could not pass a sentence of imprisonment or death .
public opinion was the major sanction behind their authority .
the administration of justice by panchayats was appreciated by early british administrators in india .
sir henry elliot in this regard ; prior to the enactment of the indian penal code in 1861 , observed :
statements of witnesses alone were not regarded as sufficient .
judges were expected to make thorough interrogations of the parties concerned and were further expected to give considerable thought to the case before pronouncing any judgement .
the machinery for the administration of justice was decentralised in the seventeenth century , in order to make it speedy and convenient for the parties concerned .
this is the precursor of the system found in our times , the courts of sub - divisional magistrates , tehsildars and naib tehsildars and so on .
other important state officials were the kotwal , the amin and the qazi .
the qazi dealt with religious offences and the kotwal mainly with secular ones .
apart from his police duties , the kotwal also enjoyed some judicial powers .
tavernier ( the french traveller ) tells us that the office of the kotwal was a sort of chowki , where a provost administered justice .
the governor and town judges dealt with civil cases , whereas the kotwal took cognisance of criminal cases .
their jurisdiction embraced the entire province .
the provincial diwan was an important judicial officer .
such an official was designated a muhatasib in the islamic states .
he could decide these suits and also order their execution .
he could not , however , hear any other cases .
morever , he could , decide the above suits only where the defendant owned up the charge .
he was not entitled to entertain those cases where the claim was in dispute .
the judgements of the provincial criminal courts were appealable to the sudder nizamat adawlut established at murshidabad and presided over by an officer appointed by the nawab .
the jurisdiction and powers exercised by the chartered supreme courts and the sudder dewany and nizamat adawluts were transferred to the high court .
each one of these high courts was to consist of a chief justice and not more than fifteen judges .
power was also given to create a fourth high court which was exercised in 1866 when high court was established at allahabad .
indian high courts act 1911 in 1911 only four provinces in british india were possessed of high courts of judicature .
another was created for lower burma at rangoon , on the model of presidency high courts , with original civil and criminal jurisdiction for rangoon .
in all the remaining provinces the highest tribunal was that of the judicial commissioner appointed by the government of india .
in exercise of the powers conferred by the act a high court was established at patna in 1915 , and another at lahore in 1919 .
it was necessarily imperfect , and with the awakening of national consciousness there was a steady demand for removal of its more glaring defects .
this effectively rang the death knell for the old concept of the king as final judge in all matters .
judiciary today it is generally presumed that the earlier form of punishment for acts which can be called criminal was private revenge .
he directly approached the principal of scottish church college dr . urquhart and told him that he wanted to go in for the honours course in philosophy .
professor urquhard was favourably impressed and agreed to take him in provided a formal consent was obtained from the principal of presidency college .
subhas found in dr . urquhart not only a tactful and considerate man but also a very able teacher of philosophy .
he was greatly excited by the tales of adventure of this officer and wanted to join the army .
the government of india had agreed to start a university unit of india defence force or territorial army .
physical tests for admission to this were not so tough as for the army and subhas was able to get in .
the experience that he gained added a new dimension to his life .
parliament has control over judges by way of impeachment only .
the supreme court consists of one chief justice and 25 associate judges .
the salary and perquisites of the chief justice of india and puisne justices of the supreme court are fixed by the constitution .
the supreme court of india has the original , appel - late and ' advispry jurisdictions .
the original jurisdiction is used rarely , though there are a few cases where it has been invoked and exercised .
the attorney general holds office during the pleasure of the president and receives such remuneration as the president determines from time to time .
some five decades ago , when the constitution was framed , the activities of the state were relatively few and limited .
as a result of this , various tribunals are / were established which are not strictly courts in the traditional sense .
they have a permanent existence and are adjudicating bodies .
the distinctions can be summarised as follows : i a court of law is a part of the traditional judicial system .
where judicial powers are derived from the state and the body deals with justice , it is called a court .
on the other hand , a tribunal is an agency created by a statute and invested with judicial powers .
ii judges of ordinary courts of law are independent of the executive in respect of their tenure , terms and conditions of service , etc .
the tribunal is competent to declare that a statutory service rule is violative of articles 14 and 16 .
i recruitment , and matters concerning recruitment , to any civil service of the state or to any civil post under the state ;
the chairman has to be a judge of the high court or one who has been judge or a vice - chairman for at least two years .
disputes should be filed before the bench within whose jurisdiction the applicant is posted for the time being .
the appellate tribunal is also deemed to be a civil court for all the purposes of section 195 and chapter xxvi of the code of criminal procedure 1973 .
manko , the daughter of the demon , sat weeping when toti the parrot of the house came to ask for his dues .
answers to these queries might give us a better insight into the history of indian bowed instruments .
he was never to look back again .
he wanted to obtain from the supreme leader of the movement a clear conception of his complete programme of action .
the first thing that subhas did on meeting gandhiji was to apologise for his foreign costume .
the mahatma , however , soon put him at ease and an interesting conversation followed .
he flooded gandhiji with questions which the latter answered with his usual patience .
on arrival in calcutta , subhas found that deshbandhu was on tour and he had to wait for a while .
the organisation was declared illegal by the government but that added more fuel to the fire .
the congress committee vested all its powers in the president chittaranjan das who , in turn , put subhas chandra in charge of the movement .
eight months in prison together with deshbandhu chittaranjan das was , for subhas , one of the most moving and educative experiences of his life .
neither the government nor their controlled press were able to produce a shred of documentary evidence to establish their charges .
however , detention without trial of subhas chandra and other promising up - coming leaders of bengal continued for nearly three years .
as mayor of calcutta , deshbandhu made a significant speech in the corporation in protest against subhas ' s arrest .
for about six weeks , subhas was permitted t6 attend to his official duties in prison in the presence of a police officer and a jail official .
he had frequent trouble with these officers and had often to take them severely to task .
as a punishment , he was transferred to berhampore jail away from calcutta .
evidently it is from these that the concert instrument has evolved .
a curious combination of the sarangi and the sitar is the dilruba ( or the esraj in bengal ) .
( 51 ) bowed instruments , then , are spread far in the country not merely geographically but ethnically and culturally .
thereafter , the government ordered his transfer to almora jail in the united provinces .
he was put on a boat sailing from rangoon and reached diamond harbour at the mouth of the river hooghly on the fourth day .
that was in may 1927 .
during the period from october 1924 to may 1927 when subhas chandra bose was languishing in burmese prisons , the political situation in india took a downward course .
one of the principal causes of this situation was the premature death of deshbandhu chittaranjan das in june 1925 .
deshbandhu reached the pinnacle of his power in 1924 and 1925 and held a commanding position in indian politics .
to subhas chandra , his closest disciple , his passing was more than a national calamityit was indeed a deep personal tragedy .
there can be no doubt that this personal bereavement also contributed to a rapid deterioration in subhas ' s health .
it remains in the history of our struggle as an immortal saga of patriotism , heroism and sacrifice .
the report of the simon commission was published in june 1930 .
while in prison , subhas was elected mayor of calcutta , but he could assume office only after his release later in the year .
in his mayoral address , subhas chandra movingly recalled deshbandhu ' s leadership in the field of civic progress .
subhas ' s blood - soaked clothes were exhibited the following day at a public meeting .
the first round table conference was held in london towards the end of 1930 without the participation of the congress .
but it was not clear whether , given all the safeguards , a truly responsible government would come into existence .
the fact was that in the absence of the indian national congress , no progress towards a settlement between india and britain was possible .
intense grief and anguish gripped the entire nation .
the karachi congress met under the presidentship of vallabhbhai patel .
eventually , they declared that although they did not approve of the pact , they would not divide the party at that critical hour .
subhas made a statement to this effect before the subjects committee .
as at lahore so at karachi , subhas chandra and others having leftist leanings were excluded from the congress working committee .
in his address , subhas chandra made a critical analysis of the gandhi - lrwin pact and a resolution was adopted condemning the pact .
subhas chandra travelled with gandhiji again after the karachi congress and observed that the mahatma was then at the pinnacle of popularity and prestige .
in april , the congress working committee selected mahatma gandhi as the sole representative of the congress to the round table conference .
the communal elements took advantage of the announcement and m . a . jinnah placed his ' fourteen points ' before him .
gandhiji pointedly asked subhas if he had any objection to separate electorates .
she found the attitude of the powers that be extremely unfriendly .
before his departure for europe , subhas chandra was brought back for a while to jabalpur jail where his brother was held .
in march 1933 , subhas reached vienna .
there , he found very good physicians and received satisfactory medical treatment .
he found a kindred spirit in vithalbhai patel who shared his interest in securing international support for indian nationalist aspirations .
soon after the suspension of the civil disobedience movement , subhas chandra was invited to preside over an indian political conference in london .
the british government by a clever design had endorsed his passport only for two european countries italy and austria .
this was to create the impression that he could not travel to other countries including britain .
he , therefore , sent his presidential address to london to be read in absentia .
in the seventeenth century england made a remarkable contribution to world civilisation through her ideas of constitutional and democratic government .
during his sojourn in europe , subhas chandra took upon himself the role of the unofficial ambassador of indian nationalism .
in the south , italy under mussolini ' s leadership was getting stronger and threatening british hegemony in the mediterranean region .
there were , however , some dissident groups in the party who wanted to make common cause with colonial and subject peoples against britain .
subhas chandra was assured by such dissident groups that they would be prepared to secretly assist revolutionary organisations in bengal .
others were working with german socialists , and finally there were young students who had recently arrived from india .
but , subhas chandra emphasised that agricultural improvement would not be enough .
industrial development under state ownership and state control would be indispensable and a new industrial system would have to be built .
it would be the task of the planning commission to work out a harmonious development of indian industries , in the best interest of the people .
by the time subhas chandra became president , the congress party had accepted office in seven out of eleven provinces of british india .
but , according to subhas , what was needed most of all was the will to be one nation and to hold together as one nation .
thus , to him , the problem of unity was largely a mass psychological problem .
the people must be educated and drilled to feel they are one nation .
that party was the congress .
it was for the congressmen to determine whether industrialisation would be comparatively gradual one as in britain or a forced march in india .
subhas chandra made it clear that while advocating industrialisation he was not ruling out cottage industries .
his election showed the vast and influential following that he had throughout the country .
during the contest , gandhiji remained silent . but after the results were announced , he acknowledged sitaramayya ' s defeat as his own .
subhas chandra met mahatma gandhi in mid - february 1939 at his ashrama at wardha , but the meeting proved infructuous .
upon his return to calcutta , subhas was taken seriously ill .
he asked for a postponment of the next meeting of the working committee later that month .
most of the members responded to his request by resigning enbloc from the working committee .
jawaharlal nehru issued a statement separately which amounted to resignation .
the congress session was scheduled to be held at tripuri near jubbulpore in madhya pradesh early in march .
he had developed pneumonia in both his lungs and no quick recovery was possible .
members of his family and a team of doctors accompanied him .
there was hectic political activity and continuous and laboured negotiations among different groups with a view to resolving the impasse .
but the majority of the old working committee was dead against any compromise or settlement with the president .
mahatma gandhi was not available on the spot for consultations as he had chosen to be away in rajkot and was fasting there on an entirely different political issue .
as the president was too ill , his address was read at the open session by his brother sarat chandra .
in his address , the president first referred to the very unusual and extraordinary circumstances under which the congress was being held .
the right wing in the congress did not share his view although he had a very large measure of support among his countrymen in general .
second , even if his first expectation was not fulfilled he could act on his own in any major crisis .
and the result would be that india would repeat her mistake of 1914 when the first world war broke out .
the propaganda offensive of the forward bloc , under subhas chandra ' s leadership was in full swing from may 1939 onwards .
however , the other leftist parties did not respond to subhas chandra ' s appeal to dissolve their separate identities and merge in the forward bloc .
the congress working committee met on the 8th september 1939 to decide upon its attitude towards the war .
meanwhile , the enemy freighter roared past over the submarine which had just dived giving it a big jerk .
the japanese submarine 1 - 29 arrived at the spot about half a day ahead of schedule from penang .
both the sides had to wait till sunrise .
but then , when dawn broke the sea was too rough and it was impossible to get the two boats near to each other .
and every patriotic indian must advance towards the field of battle .
during the one year that preceded netaji ' s arrival in east asia , much efforts were made by patriotic indians there to organise the indian independence movement .
unfortunately , however , owing to inadequacy of leadership and inexperience in international affairs , the movement broke down .
when netaji arrived , it was in utter disarray and the ina was in a state of suspended animation .
on the 4th july 1943 , a general assembly of the indian independence league was held in singapore with the representatives from all over east asia .
in a magnificent and statesmanlike gesture , rash behari bose handed over the leadership of the entire movement to netaji .
the aim and purpose of this organisation would be to take up arms against british imperialism . "
indians in east asia responded to their chosen leader in full measure .
with the force of arms and at the cost of your blood you will have to win liberty .
we must build up our national defence on such unshakable foundations that never again in our history shall we lose our freedom . . . . . " .
" my soldiers !
let your battle - cry be - ' to delhi !
to delhi ! "
the old texts also specify that members of a court should not connive with the king if he acts unjustly .
if they do , they , along with the king , will fall head down - wards into hell .
the evidence act makes the evidence of experts relevant for arriving at a decision .
unanimous decisions which would leave no room for doubt were regarded as the best alternative .
where there was no unanimity among the judges , the opinion of the majority of sabhyas ( judges ) would prevail which is also the case today .
while arriving at a conclusion on a question of fact , he could also take the help of merchants appointed to assist the court .
the growth of justice was connected with the social and political conditions of the time .
the moral and political theories determined the origin and development of law .
the judicial system in the early world was dominated by royal legislation .
kautilya ' s conception of law , though stringent , was comprehensive and all - embracing in character .
according to him , law was the eternal order , it was justice and duty .
danda or punishment was the basis of the state .
laws were made to synchronise with people ' s needs and economic conditions .
kautilya said , " law is a royal command enforced by sanction and the regulating factor of all types of human activities " .
the kantakasodhana court was meant to provide protection to the people against anti - social forces .
there is little doubt that the kantakasodhana was a very important court .
it may be characterised as a quasi - judicial department and is compared more or less favourably with the court of star chamber in england .
it was in this court that disputes arising out of the violation of state laws and regulations were tried .
the following important items came under such courts :
i protection of the interests of artisans ;
ii protection of the interests of merchants ;
iii ways and means of dealing with national calamities ;
preventing people from maintaining themselves by sordid means ;
appeal from the judgements of this court lay to the privy council , subject to certain restrictions .
the mayor ' s court at calcutta was abolished , but the court of request continued to exist .
the supreme court began to apply english rules of law and procedure , regardless of indian conditions .
it refused to recognise the government of the nawab or the authority of his agents and of the provincial courts .
to avoid vagueness an amending act was passed in 1781 which clearly defined the powers and extent of jurisdiction of the supreme court .
they had jurisdiction over british subjects resident in the territories of the governments of madras and bombay or in the native states in alliance with those governments .
courts of request were established by a charter of 1753 .
their decrees were not valid until revised and countersigned by the judge .
iii dewany adawluts or city and zillah courts .
under regulation v of 1831 several important changes were made .
register courts and the provincial courts of appeal were abolished .
original jurisdiction was given to the judges in all suits exceeding rs 5,000 - in value with an appeal direct to the sudder dewany adawlut .
the system of civil courts established by lord cornwallis in bengal was adopted in madras presidency in 1802 .
revenue and civil courts were kept distinct .
where the value involved was rs 45,000 or more , a further appeal lay to the governor - general in council .
in 1826 the heads of villages were appointed moonsiffs with the power to try suits of the value not exceeding rs 10 .
village panchayats could also determine suits of any amount within the jurisdiction of their villages .
in 1843 the provincial courts of appeal were abolished , and new zillah courts established .
in bombay also civil courts were established after the bengal regulation of 1793 .
in 1845 the appointment of joint zillah judges was authorised .
the system did not work satis - factorily .
in bombay it was the magistrates , zillah judges , and the court of circuit who exercised criminal jurisdiction .
a special court also existed for the trial of political offences .
in 1841 it was enacted that political offences should be cognisable by the ordinary courts .
the right was also reserved in reference to the supreme court at fort william and recorder ' s courts ( subsequently the supreme courts ) at madras and bombay .
this invidious right itself was taken away by act xi of 1836 , commonly known as the black act .
till 1813 euro - pean residents in india were subject to the criminal juris - diction of only the crown courts in the presidency towns .
another step towards amalgamation was the estab - lishment , throughout the country , of a uniform system of laws .
the codification and simplification of law was one of the greatest reforms effected during this period .
secondly , even where it could be ascertained , it often embodied rules which were repug - nant to the ideas and traditions underlying the english legal system .
for this purpose , the 1935 act provided for the establishment of the federal court , the forerunner of the supreme court of india .
the jurisdiction of the court was wide and included :
private revenge often led to blood feuds between families , clans or tribes .
however , feuds particularly between powerful families of different communities continued to be one of the causes of war .
religious leaders often played the role of moderators of conflicts and punishers of offences .
if the punishment meted out to wrongdoers was commensurate with the crime they had committed , it was thought to lessen the gods ' fury .
in addition to this , there was also something called state revenge .
i criminal conspiracy ;
ii offences against the state ;
iii forfeiture of property ;
the courts can award any or a combination of any of the above punishments depending upon the offence committed .
so , for example , there can be imprisonment with fine or different sentences of imprisonment for various offences to run concurrently ' or consequently .
this was later supplemented by the 1898 act .
as civil and criminal proceedings are dealt with by dif - ferent courts , procedures and the law applicable are also different .
generally , there is one court of sessions in every session division though there may be more such judges in the court .
these may be designated as additional sessions judges or assistant sessions judges , and they are judges of the same court .
the additional sessions judge tries all those cases which are assigned by the sessions judge .
however , an appeal from the court of the magistrate can be entertained and heard only by the sessions judge .
the place where he is to hold his court is appointed by the high court .
a sessions court has both appellate and revisional jurisdiction over the inferior courts .
it also has original jurisdiction to try sessions cases , but it has no power to take cognisance of such cases unless they are committed by a magistrate .
such courts deal and decide the cases and appeals as provided in the criminal proce - dure code .
under the civil procedure code the main stages through which a case runs are the following :
1 initiation of a proceeding by riling a plaint or an application ;
iv recording of evidence of the plaintiff / petitioner , defendant / respondent ; and finally v delivery of judgement by the court .
in these broad stages the trial really begins after the issues have been framed .
that is why the arbitration act specifically provides for approaching an appropriate court for obtaining such interlocutory orders from a civil court .
materials are submitted by way of pleadings and evidence .
the aforesaid procedure is common to all civil courts throughout the country .
the role of the judge generally is not only that of an impartial observer but also of an active instrument who enforces the rules of the game .
however , there is a serious controversy in this sphere .
there are some judges who believe in being ' activist judges ' and others who do not wish to enter the arena of conflict at all .
sometimes in appropriate cases proceedings may be held in camera , for example in matrimonial or espionage cases , etc .
costs in civil cases , while passing any order and decree , the court has the discretion to grant costs .
thus the word ' costs ' included costs incidental to the suit .
however , it is subject to various limitations and restraints which the court itself imposes upon itself while granting costs to the winning party .
all the high courts organically form integral parts of a single system although their territorial jurisdictions are defined .
no high court can claim superiority over the other .
all the high courts have the same status under the constitution .
however , they do not constitute anything like a single all - india cadre .
high courts have original as well as appellate jurisdiction , as provided in civil procedure code .
the power to issue the writs and orders under article 226 belongs to all the high courts in india .
such power extends to all persons or authorities , including even governments , within the jurisdiction of the high court , whether original or appellate .
this being a constitutional power , the power under article 226 is not fettered by anything contained in any statutory provision .
the jurisdiction under article 226 extends to revenue matters unlike under the government of india act .
although introduced with the best of intentions , this remedy of enforcement of fundamental and other rights has become a much misused one .
oral arguments are heard at length apart from written briefs .
the commission has specifically been granted powers of contempt of court if its orders are violated .
therefore , the consumer protection act , 1986 was enacted to provide for better protection of interests of the consumers .
it received the assent of the president on 24th of december , 1986 .
i district level for &amp; these fora are established by the respective state governments with the approval of the central government in each district of the state ;
ii state commissions : state commissions are established by the state government - . with the prior approval of the central government in each state ;
it also has the power of revision .
it has the power to hear appeals by any person aggrieved by the order of the state commission and it also has revisional powers .
appeal from the national commission is provided direct to the supreme court under section 23 of the act .
this should be filed within 30 days of the date of the order .
the consumer fora give valuable service to consumers .
it is not bound by cumbersome rules of evidence and civil procedure .
it is a speedy and inexpensive remedy as no court fee is required to be paid .
any individual or any ' recognised consumer association can also approach the forum on behalf of the consumer in general . '
the court martial , though a legal tribunal , is not part of the judiciary of the country .
the summary general court martial consists of not less than three officers .
the summary court martial is held by the commanding officer of any corps , department or detachment of the regular army to which the accused belongs .
his role is of an adviser and the prosecutor and accused are at all times entitled to his opinion on questions of law both inside and outside the court .
he carried on a long correspondence with his second elder brother sarat chandra , poured out his heart to him and sought his counsel .
during these seven long months , he considered and weighed every possible aspect of the matter including family responsibilities and monetary considerations .
subhas said in reply that indians would get home rule in ten years , or even earlier , only if they were prepared to pay the price .
the price , according to him , was service , sacrifice and suffering .
but , he was not particularly concerned about such family or social opposition .
he felt sorry that he had been instrumental in introducing discord into an otherwise harmonious family .
the reason was that certain ideas had taken possession of him which were unfortunately unacceptable to others .
the first meeting between these two men was decisive .
deshbahdhu welcomed his new youthful lieutenant with open arms and entrusted him with a number of responsibilities .
the country was then convulsing with patriotic fervour and there was unparalled popular enthusiasm .
the competence and dedication with which sub - has discharged various duties assigned to him won the admiration of all .
a visit to india of the prince of wales was announced for november 1921 .
the congress called upon the people to observe a total " hartal " on the day scheduled for the prince ' s landing in bombay .
there was , however , complete freedom of expression and debate inside his own party organisation which was tempered with commendable restraint discipline and unity of action .
fourthly , desh - bandhu was a great lover of youth and identified himself completely with their sufferings , hopes and aspirations .
during the eight months in prison together , subhas tended and cared for deshbandhu with all the warmth and devotion of which he was capable .
he would not only look after his creature comforts to the minutest detailhe would even cook for him .
it , therefore , became a joke how lucky deshbandhu was to have an " i . c . s . cook " at his disposal !
in early february 1922 at chauri chaura in united provinces , villagers in a fit of wild excitement set fire to a police station and killed some policemen .
gandhiji was shocked at this turn of events and at his instance the congress working committee suspended the civil disobedience movement .
on receipt of the news of termination of the campaign , they were overwhelmed with sorrow and resentment .
congressmen were bewildered at the sudden retreat and the general mood changed from one of bouyant optimism to depression .
subhas stood loyally by his leader .
in september 1922 , there were devastating floods in the northern districts of bengal .
deshbandhu , thereupon , resigned as the president since he wanted to work in opposition to the official resolutions of the party .
the swarajists , subhas chandra has recorded , " parted with a sense of defeat , but with the determination to fight and win . "
subhas and other adherents of deshbandhu returned to bengal from the gaya congress in a rather depressed mood .
but , the swarajists made steady headway by sheer determination , hard work and campaigning among congressmen .
while subhas and other lieutenants functioned at the grassroots , the leaders deshbandhu and pandit motilal toured the country .
by the middle of 1923 , the swarajists were on level with the ' no - changers ' .
in the elections , the swarajists achieved remarkable success .
das undertook a fast unto death demanding ! treatment of revolutionary prisoners as political prisoners under trial .
the government having declined to fulfil the demand , he continued his fast till the bitter end and diecl in prison on 13th september 1929 .
they , therefore , returned disappointed and came to the lahore congress empty - handed .
the historic lahore congress met under the presidentship of jawaharlal nehru at the end of december 1929 .
to the masses of india , the event was one of the great inspiration and brought forth a new message .
he urged that a positive programme of action be adopted to enforce the national demand .
in his opinion , merely taking a negative stand by asking congressmen to resign from the legislatures was not enough .
in the course of his address to the lahore congress , subhas chandra said : " mine is a programme of all - round boycott . . . .
with civil disobedience came boycott of british goods , disobedience of the law of sedition , picketing of liquor shops , etc .
responding to a special appeal of mahatma gandhi , women in their hundreds and thousands joined the campaign and their enthusiasm stirred the men to greater efforts and sacrifice .
hundreds of people were shot and killed .
while the country was going through a great upheaval , a sensational revolutionary action took place in chit - tagong in april .
a band of death - defying youngmen under the leadership of surya sen attacked the armoury , took possession of the weapons and then retired to the hills .
they continued guerilla warfare for days together and british rule ceased to exist in the area .
the majority of them were called in action and the rest went underground .
the british military carried on an orgy of repression throughout bengal .
but , there was no appreciable improvement in the general situation .
a half - hearted eleventh hour agreement between gandhiji and the viceroy was somehow worked out in august and gandhiji sailed for england .
the mahatma emphatically challenged such assertions claiming that congress represented 85 per cent of india ' s population .
it was subhas chandras ' s view that the mahatama ' s london visit was badly planned and his entourage did not include good and proper advisers .
he was also of the view that he should have gone there in 1930 when he could have secured better terms from the british .
gandhiji returned to india on the last day of 1931 and was given a warm and cordial welcome home .
while he was away , the government had perfected its plans to start a policy of ruthless repression .
in july , he presided over the galcdjta session of . the all india trade union congress where the delhi pact was also disapproved .
the government , in trun , steppe ' d up their policy of terror including the imposition of aweiled form of martial law in many districts .
leaders were arrested in mass including gandhiji , jawaharlal and sub - has chandra .
the people of india fought back heroically . but , this time they were at a disadvantage because the enemy was totally prepared and utterly ruthless .
after his arrest in january 1932 , subhas chandra was lodged in a small jail in seoni , an obscure place in central provinces .
he was joined soon by his elder brother sarat chandra , a leading lawyer of calcutta , front - rank congressman and alderman of calcutta corporation .
ever since his childhood , subhas held a special position in the affections of this brother and his wife bivabati .
such comradeship of brothers , in ideology , service and suffering is a unique phenomenon in the history of nations .
" the recent speech of herr hitler in munich gives the essence of nazi philosophy . . . . which had a very weak scientific foundation . . .
i want to point out that it is historically false to say that europe and asia should not be at peace with one another .
italy was a country of great interest to subhas chandra for valid historical reasons .
an adjournment motion in the central legislative assembly moved by the opposition challenging the government to prove charges against him in a court of law was carried .
his eyes irradiated with a lustre that had not been there eight years ago . "
the dharmvirs had become close friends of subhas and took charge of nursing him back to health .
general elections had since been held and the congress party came out victorious with absolute majorities in six out of eleven provinces of british india .
this , he did at the very last moment , but with remarkable facility and in a single draft .
he wrote page after page of the address sitting in his bedroom in his ancestral house on elgin road .
a courier rushed the completed pages to his brother ' s house round the corner at woodburn park .
there his brother sarat ' s secretariat prepared the typescript which was , in turn , rushed to the press .
the printed address was not ready when the president - elect left for haripura with his mother and other members of the family .
it was sent the next day to be in . time for distribution at the open session of the congress .
he emphasised that the very first thing that our national government would have to do is to set up a planning commission .
the plan would have an immediate component and a long period programme .
unification on the above basis under a strong central government was necessary to withstand any possible foreign invasion .
regarding reconstruction , the principal problem would be to eradicate poverty .
this process continues to repeat itself .
the greatest heritage of the vedic hindu age is the idea of unitism in the upanishads generally known as the philosophy of the vedanta .
this disturbed for some time the cultural unity of the country but enriched the indian mind with a profusion and variety of new ideas .
at the end of the first world war , new political circumstances caused something like a revolution in the attitude of the educated classes .
this sudden change in attitude was only partly due to the disillusionment and resentment caused by the reform act of 1919 .
a more powerful factor was the economic depression which followed the wartime boom , and for the first time unmasked before indian eyes the ugly face of imperialistic capitalism .
during the war many industrial factories had sprung up , most of them with british capital .
similarly there was a whole army of educated unemployed .
but after the elections when the congress formed ministries in the provinces , the nationalist muslim politicians grumbled that they were given too few offices .
so the general pro - muslim attitude of the congress did undergo a substantial though , subtle change .
during his stay abroad he also visited switzerland , germany and england , winning many disciples in london .
in 1897 he founded the ramakrishna mission to serve as a model for such organisations .
in 1899 he built the math ( monastery ) at bellur for the sadhus of his order and set up the advaita ashrama at almora .
he retired to the math at bellur , teaching vedanta philosophy to his disciples till his death in 1902 .
born at calcutta in 1872 , he had his education from the age of seven to twenty - one in england .
a profound religious experience at this time changed the whole course of his life .
in politics all conservatives agreed in opposing foreign domination and supporting hindu nationalism .
the struggle between the liberals and the conservatives ended in the victory of the latter .
the poet , tagore , made his point of view patent in greater india .
he emphasised that india ' s history was not made by hindus alone .
centuries ago muslims arrived with their cultural heritage and became part of her history .
new india was not the monopoly of any one creed or race .
ness of a group of people speaking the same language that makes them form a distinct community is natural and legitimate . .
it is this chauvinism , unfortunately present in india , which has created a painful situation : after states were re -
organised on a linguistic basis , the cultural and other rights of linguistic minorities in each state have been disregarded in many cases .
according to him : " the main purpose of the quran is to awaken in man the higher consciousness of his manifold relations with god and the universe . "
in one place tagore says : " but there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in , reigns the stainless white radiance .
there is no day nor night , nor form nor colour , and never , never a word . "
and again only with this ego how can love be possible ? "
he should realise that his own action , like his existence as an individual , is mere appearance , a mere name .
the bhagwad gita is not only a commentary on but a supplement to the upanishads .
similarly , action is ranked inferior to knowledge .
this great object cannot be achieved through the senses and reason but only through the irrational faculty called intuition .
so in training the mind it is necessary to keep the intellectual faculties in check and to awaken mystical consciousness by ascetic self - discipline .
in the apprehension of reality the struggle for the conquest of nature is of greater help than the ascetic self - discipline of the sufi .
it should never induce repose , mellowness , acquiescence but a creative restlessness , a dynamic vivacity , a prophetic zeal .
" what art aims at is the eternal flame of life , not these few moments of breathing like sparks . . . .
fallen nations do not rise without a miracle .
true art strikes its way through the nile like the miraculous wand of moses . "
the adoption of a democratic constitution made a change in the official language inevitable .
as long as power was in the hands of a few englishmen who did not require the consent of the common people , english could be the official language .
but when the ! time came for drawing up the constitution circumstances had changed .
in view of these objections adequate safeguards were provided in the constitution .
today we are faced with the same problem . but this time it is more complex and has several new aspects .
the attempt to separate these ingredients and get them out of the system through a process of blood - letting will never succeed .
it will only enervate our culture and cause it to suffer from pernicious anaemia .
the first thing , then , that we have to realise is that the dominating complexion of the present common culture is that of the north indian culture .
that is why its influence over the south is very limited .
to be truly national it has to assimilate the best elements of the various regional cultures specially those of south india .
this requires a maximum cultural contact .
still , we have to make a close study of the social and political institutions in europe , america and the socialist world and learn many things from them .
if we respect human life , the material resources required to keep men alive are also worthy of our respect .
but it is necessary to supplement this with carrying urban art and culture to the villages .
they generally believed that this could be done without a fundamental change in the social structure .
their purpose could be achieved by merely relaxing some of the restrictions imposed by these systems .
so some daring reformers challenged the caste system and carried on a campaign to put an end to it .
the advent of independence naturally gave an impetus to social reform and the combined efforts of the government and private agencies accelerated its progress .
the government , no doubt , does all it can to enforce these laws .
special concessions are given to harijans in education as well as in employment .
women are given office and honours according to their merit .
the courts of law do them full justice in cases relating to marriage and inheritance .
but in society old prejudices persist and inequality and injustice prevail as before .
to root them out is not in the power of governments and courts but requires the reforming zeal and missionary effort of private individuals and institutions .
private agencies and individuals , therefore , have to shoulder a far greater burden than the state in the work of social reform .
theirs is . a two - fold task in the critical period through which the country is passing .
as we said in the beginning , the circumstances which are leading us towards this change are the direct result of our political freedom .
consequently , the large joint family units are breaking up into smaller ones consisting of husband , wife and children .
moreover , the number of men and women who marry very late in life or do not marry at all , is increasing .
at the same time people are migrating from the villages into towns .
these changes give rise to fresh problems .
what was the secret of this strength ?
where did it come from ?
i thought of what india had accomplished in eastern asia , in angkor , borobudur , and many other places .
our reactions varied and depended on our previous environment and experience .
much had gone in the battering they had received during the past 200 years .
yet something remained that was worth while , and with it so much that was worthless and evil .
that entanglement grew in later years and influenced my mental outlook greatly .
they were led by a man named ramachandra , who himself was not a local peasant .
they would accept no denial and literally clung on to us .
at last i promised to visit them two days or so later .
after school and college education in england , practised as a lawyer in india for six years .
was jailed repeatedly for political activities seven terms from 1921 to 1935 , varying from six months to two years .
has been specially identified with demand for independence of india as democratic state , and has laid stress on international problems in relation to india .
socialistic views .
i have been affected by this and so , in a sense , i am favourably disposed towards these assumptions . . . .
but i do not believe in any of these or other theories and assumptions as a matter of religious faith .
the practical achievements of the soviet union were also tremendously impressive .
usually , however , i have refrained latterly from expressing this opinion because of the orders of my chief .
to - day she swings between a blind adherence to her old customs and a slavish imitation of foreign ways .
in neither of these can she find relief - or life or growth .
it is obvious that she has to come out of her shell and take full part in the life and activities of the modern age .
it should be equally obvious that there can - be no real cultural or spiritual growth based on imitation .
such imitation can only be confined to a small number which cuts itself off from the masses and , the springs of national life .
art and literature remain lifeless if they are continually thinking of foreign models .
we , are citizens of no mean country and we are proud of the land of our birth , of our people , our culture and traditions .
and we have to hurry , for the - time at our disposal is limited and the pace of the world grows ever swifter .
it was india ' s way in the past to welcome and absorb other cultures .
my generation has been a troubled one in india and the world .
of course , i had relief in the past by spinning and weaving etc .
i have read relatively little and at the slightest pretext i put aside my book .
living in the tent has helped in the process and the cloudy weather has also lured me out .
yet on occasions the shell bursts to my great discomfiture .
to begin with , the impact swept the lower middle class outside the congress although it was larger in number .
the congress became predominantly a lower middle class organisation .
we were unfortunate to lose a group of liberals .
in america , the state is giving bounties to the farmers to burn their crops .
can you imagine anything more foolish than that ?
that is the stage of civilisation which we have reached under the sway of capitalism in the world .
in india , we do not quite see the tremendous happenings because of the fact that ours is not a fully capitalist country .
we are still a semi - feudal country .
you should prepare yourselves for the big things that are going to happen .
whatever is going to happen , we are not going to have a quiet life and a static life .
political freedom took new shape then and acquired a new content .
janaka and yajnavalka had said , at the dawn of our history , that it was the function of the leaders of a people to make them fearless .
not many accepted his views in their entirety ; some disagreed with that fundamental outlook .
it was basically concerned with his firm belief in the moral law , which he calls the law of truth or love .
if that is the condition of the world at large , what of our own unhappy country ?
your immediate problem and mine is to gain political freedom for our country , but this is only part of the problem facing us .
so long as imperialism is not rooted out , mankind will be exploited and oppressed by a few .
most of the puranas are named after vishnu and some after brahma or shiva .
such compilations were known to the hindus from the earliest times .
law and order are the last refuge of the reactionary , of the tyrant and of him who has power and refuses to part with it .
the freedom of india is dear to all of us here .
our desire for freedom is a thing more of the mind than of the body , although even our bodies often suffer for the lack of freedom .
what is the meaning of this flag ?
the flag under which you stand today and which you have just now saluted does not belong to any community .
it is the flag of the country .
commentaries on old works were written in large numbers in strict accordance with the elaborate rules laid down for the commentators .
this degeneration dates from the time when the invading shakas , hunas and gurjars put an end to the gupta empire and settled in india .
the rajput courts became centres of art , literature , poetry and drama .
before him raja mahindiapal of kanauj was the patron of the noted dramatist shekhar .
under his patronage the new faith flourished as it had never done before .
no lasting empire of the stature of the maurya empire could be established during the period .
at first they were known as yavanas and regarded as foreigners , but were finally assimilated into hindu society as kshatriyas .
they were followed within a short time by the pallavas whose name indicated their persian origin .
later , in the tenth and eleventh centuries several shaivite and vishnavite acharyas tried to put the idea of bhakti on a philosophical basis .
ramanuja based his teachings like shankaracharya on the vedanata , the philosophy of the - upanishads .
he too believes god to be the one and only being but he invests him with attributes .
god is the master of all ( iswara ) and the supreme soul ( pursottam ) .
he is the creator , preserver , and destroyer of the world .
he created out of himself matter ( prakriti ) and spirit ( jiva ) but it did not make the least difference to the integrity of his being .
matter and spirit have both a degree of reality but their existence is not independent of god .
they are merely accidents of his being and subservient to his will .
al - fihrist mentions a philosophical work by bedba .
this according to professor sachau , was the vedanta sutra of badarayana vyasa .
as long as sind was under the abbasides the work of translation from sanskrit into arabic continued .
but the cultural influence exercised by the muslims over sind and gujarat during this period has not yet fully come to light .
in any case , muslim influence on indian culture in the south and west was limited and indirect .
this region occupied a central position in the old world and was the meeting point of three continents .
there is another world where he will get the final reward or retribution for the sum total of his actions .
contrary to the attitude taken by many other religions , islam does not deprecate the value of this world and this life .
as to the degree of reality the world possesses , from the point of view of absolute existence it does not interest the quran .
what it emphasises is that from the relative point of view of man the world has as much reality as he himself .
this affirmation of life and of the physical world is peculiar to islam .
as we have seen , this concept of the world implies that its creator is the one supreme being , the preserver , the gracious and merciful .
these are the basic attributes of god from which many others are derived .
the quran has dealt with the attributes of god definitely and comprehensively but it observes the greatest caution in discussing his essential being .
but the aga khan or the british government could not stop the inevitable drift of the muslim bourgeoisie towards nationalism .
the world war hastened the process , and as new leaders arose the aga khan seemed to retire into the background .
even aligarh college changed its tone , and among the new leaders the most dynamic were the ali brothers , both products of aligarh .
it was a slow process , but it was a continuous one .
the muslim communal organisations were more successful in regaining some of their old prestige among the muslim masses .
the question of the essential nature of god and the world is the most delicate in speculative philosophy .
not only in theology but also in metaphysics , the concept of essence is generally more negative than positive .
the positive aspect of his nature is not discussed at all .
very great stress is laid on the unity of god in the quran .
it forbids the sharing of any of god ' s attributes , let alone his essential being , in thought or speech .
but as far as freedom from conditions is concerned , the quran follows a middle path .
the love of and devotion to the supreme one is the first and foremost duty of the believer .
i do not remember any one referring to present - day muslim art or muslim music .
the two languages which have influenced muslim thought in india are arabic and persian , and especially the latter .
but the influence of persian has no element of religion about it .
the persian language and many persian customs and traditions came to india in the course of thousands of years and impressed themselves powerfully all over north india .
that is a common and a precious heritage for all of us in india .
pride in the past achievements of islamic races and countries is probably one of the strongest of islamic bonds .
does any one grudge the muslims this noble record of various races ?
no one can take it away from them so long as they choose to remember it and cherish it .
it is the fear complex that we have to deal with in these communal problems .
honest communalism is fear ; false communalism is political reaction .
to some extent this fear is justified , or is at least understandable , in a minority community .
there is no essential difference between the two .
the hindu mahasabha leaders largely confined themselves to criticising the congress .
when however there was a lull in congress activities , automatically the hindu communalists came more to the front and their attitude was frankly reactionary .
it must be remembered that the communalism of a majority community must of necessity bear a closer resemblance to nationalism than the communalism of a minority group .
if it is politically reactionary or lays stress on communal problems rather than national ones then it is obviously anti - national .
they have no programme except a negative one , as the mahasabha hinted at ajmer , of not disturbing the present social order .
this itself shows that the controlling forces of these communal organizations are the upper class , possessing social groups today .
i do not think that hindu - muslim or other unity will come merely by reciting it like a mantra .
he was caught up in the general weaknessverbosity and forgot the main point .
if a country is not dependent upon others economically and politically , it is then called independent .
here also there is often a deception countries politically free are , behind the screen , economically slaves to some other country .
still , we can say that countries that are politically and economically free are independent .
in such an independent country there does not arise any question of social and cultural freedom , for that is implied .
historians are of the opinion that with the establishment of muslim kingdoms the centre of hindu civilisation and culture shifted towards the south of india .
there the muslim penetration was less .
the reason for it is obvious .
in our country the punjab and sind had the closest relations with the muslim kings and kingdoms .
but today the hindu mahasabha has the punjab as its stronghold and in the south it is hardly known .
he kept silent and did not reply .
he accepted the gods and rituals of egypt , only mixing a few of his own gods of greek origin with them .
then after many years it came under the sway of the roman empire .
islam is there for the last 1300 years .
in saying that egypt has lost its identity , what does bhaiji mean ?
of the last 7,000 years of history which period does he consider as the era of the real egyptian identity ?
in iran also islam had an easy victory .
but the civilisation of the modern world is that of mighty machinery and gigantic workshops .
what have they to do with religions ?
so many movements were afoot to remove casteism among hindus but the greatest revolution was caused by the railway , the tram and the lorry .
who bothers about the caste of fellow - passengers there ? . . .
mr . jinnah , it seems to me , has said something which surely is communalism raised to the nth power .
this objection and demand bear a strong family likeness to what bhai parmanand has often said on behalf of the hindu communalists .
but it knows that the masses , hindu and muslim , care little for communal questions .
the procession was certainly an interesting one and it had certain unique features .
in music , stirring and inspiring tunes were preferred to depressing and doleful ones .
( c ) the khilafat of banu abbas .
the third phase opened with an aggravation of disintegrating factors because the abbasi khilafat gave up all pretence of ruling in the spirit of democracy .
how , then , can we change it or shape it to our liking by resolutions or orders from above ?
and yet that variation is but the mirror of the rapid changes taking place among the people who use it .
what should be the policy of the state in regard to language ?
by this declaration the congress is bound , and no minority or linguistic group can require a wider assurance .
the language of the people in north and central india continued to be hindi throughout .
a highly persianized form of hindi developed round the imperial courts ' , and this was called rekhta .
right up to the revolt of 1857 , urdu meant hindi , except in regard to script .
as is well known , some of the finest hindi poets have been muslims .
till this revolt , and even for some time after , the usual term applied to the language was hindi .
this did not refer to the script , but to the language , the language of hind .
muslims who wrote in the urdu script usually called the language hindi .
on what must this unity be based ?
the masses must be the common factor between hindi and urdu .
most of our present troubles are due to highly artificial literary languages cut off from the masses .
when writers write , whom do they write for ?
every writer must have , consciously or subconsciously , an audience in his mind , whom he is seeking to influence or convert to his viewpoint .
he thinks much more of the literary coteries in which he moves , and writes for them in the language that they have come to appreciate .
is it surprising that hindi and urdu books have restricted sales ?
so in a way , the contact between islamic culture and hindu culture had already begun in the eighth century .
the impetus which the bhakti movement among the hindus received from muslim ideas has also been mentioned .
the first invasion of the punjab was made by subuktagin in 986 - 987 .
it is also desirable , i think , for our languages to cultivate contacts with foreign literatures by means of translations of both the old classics and modern books .
i have said previously that we should not object to the development of hindi or urdu separately .
but the formation of artificial words with no real sanction behind them has no such significance .
to a large extent we have to form artificial words to meet the growing needs of our political , economic , scientific , and commercial life .
many foreign words can and should thus be taken in , but many technical words will have to be taken from our own language also .
it is desirable that linguistic and technical experts should make a list of such words for common use .
any attempt to influence this evolution by mixing up the consideration of other languages in india is doomed to failure .
but one thing more .
this talk of muslim culture and hindu culture in this connection astonishes me .
india has a very powerful national culture but it has been influenced by equally powerful influences of other cultures .
i refuse to consider these separate trends as hindu or muslim .
at " whose doors will they knock thereafter ?
* where , in the context of the problems of hunger , want and ' sickness , does the communal problem fit in ?
today our major problems have to do with achieving independence and building the country anew .
can the muslim league or the hindu mahasabha tackle these problems ?
i stagger to think that these problems do not even figure in their programmes ' . . . .
* for every vote cast for the congress means voting for the independence of the country .
i lay emphasis on discipline , unity and a spirit of cooperation among hindus and muslims .
the congress gradually developed a foreign policy which was based on the elimination of political and economic imperialism everywhere and the cooperation of free nations .
this fitted in with the demand for indian independence .
this was five or six years before hitler came into power and before japanese aggression in manchuria had begun .
mussolini was consolidating himself in italy but did not then appear as a major threat to world peace .
fascist italy was on friendly terms with england and british statesmen expressed their admiration for the duce .
there were a number of petty dictators in europe , also usually on good terms with the british government . . . .
in india also there were those who objected to our lining up with republican spain and china , abyssinia and czechoslovakia .
the moslem league remained throughout discreetly silent and never committed itself on any such international issue .
in 1938 the congress sent a medical unit consisting of a number of doctors and necessary equipment and material to china .
for several years this unit did good work there .
when this was organized , subhas bose was president of the congress .
he did not approve of any step being taken by the congress which was anti - japanese or anti - german or anti - italian .
in those days the new doctrine of the trusteeship of the indian peoples was not mentioned , .
our oppression was perhaps not worse than it is today , but it was franker .
this was bad enough but even worse followed .
that , i say , was the deliberate policy of the british in india and they carried it out by trying to divide us among ourselves .
having disarmed us they tell us that we are not capable of defending our country .
well , what is the condition of india today ?
we talk about exploitation .
not merely a single exploitation , as it may be called , but sometimes double or even a triple one .
then again , we often have an unholy alliance of british capitalists with indian capitalists .
after all , we here know a great deal of the british empire .
naturally , therefore , from their capitalist and imperialist points of view they wanted to do everything in their power to hold on to india .
the result is that india has suffered and is suffering .
on account of india a large number of other countries have suffered and are suffering .
they were sent in spite of the fact that the national congress of india expressed its strongest opposition .
they have been to egypt , to abyssinia , in the persian gulf , to mesopotamia , arabia , syria , georgia , tibet , afghanistan and burma .
the lining - up of europe in mutually hostile and anti - fascist groups represents the conflict of that imperialism with the new forces that threaten it .
it is clear that any breach in the imperialist front anywhere has its repercussions all over the world .
a victory of fascism in europe or elsewhere strengthens imperialism and reacts everywhere , a setback to it weakens imperialism .
we were hardly conscious then of what was happening outside .
and if we do so we cannot fail to observe an organic connection between them which endures through changing situations .
so far as i am concerned the racial or the religious issue does not affect my opinion .
but my reading of war - time and post - war history shows that there was a gross betrayal of the arabs by british imperialism .
zionist policy aimed at this domination and worked for it , though , i believe , some sections of jewish opinion were opposed to this aggressive attitude .
inevitably , the zionists opposed the arabs and looked for protection and support to the british government .
such case as the zionists had might be called a moral one , their ancient associations with their holy land and their present reverence for it .
but what of the arabs ?
what further infamy , what greater betrayal is afoot ?
incredible , unbelievable things have already happened and one ' s capacity for astonishment is already past .
a british prime minister functions as an emissary of hitler and fascism and works for fascist domination over europe .
patriotism , nationalism , peace are mouthed by all these gentlemen , but the object in view is the triumph of hitler .
suddenly , as if by a flash of lightning , the true motives of the statesman are lighted up .
the ruling classes , the top dogs have no use for freedom or democracy .
what does it matter provided the class interests of m . bonnet and mr . chamberlain are safe ?
i go to her with my homage and my greeting .
friends have warned me of possible danger and probable risks .
we have forgotten ourselves .
but we shall find ourselves again and meet the evil face to face and scotch it and end it .
and we shall enter the fray again with love for india in our hearts and the burning desire to free her people urging us ever on .
but my heart will be in india and my mind will carry her picture wherever i go .
in the colonies also the principle of self - determination should be applied , and steps should be taken to democratise them .
all discrimination based on race must go .
we can admit no peace settlement over the bodies of colonial peoples .
it is in no spirit of bargaining that we make these suggestions , nor is there the slightest desire to take advantage of another ' s difficulty .
we sympathise with that difficulty , but that sympathy cannot make us forget our own difficulties and disabilities .
the war will not be won by mercenary armies with mercenary motives , how so ever efficient they might be .
the national planning committee can be of great assistance in this work . . . .
we do not know .
the world is pregnant with possibilities .
it has no pity at any time for the weak or the ineffective or the disunited .
of the great cities of continental europe how many have been reduced to dust and rubble .
it cannot be the same again , but it may recover some of the old atmosphere .
the war has not actually ended in europe , it appears , but it must end soon .
peace seems far distant now , a dream that has faded , and mankind apparently marches ahead to its doom .
peace and cooperation and wellbeing for all the peoples of the world were well within grasp .
but the gods perhaps envied the lot of man and drove him mad .
it was not only a vague desire , but the compulsion of events that forced all of us to think along these lines .
during the past two hundred years we have seen the growth of western imperialisms and of the reduction of large parts of asia to colonial or semicolonial status .
india always had contacts and intercourse with her neighbour countries in the north west , the north - east , the east and the south - east .
i do not wish to speak to you of the past , but rather of the present .
we meet here not to discuss our past history and contacts , but to forge links for the future .
and may i say here that this conference , and the idea underlying it , is in no way aggressive or aganist any other continent or country ?
we piopose to stand on our own legs and to cooperate with all others who are prepared to cooperate with us .
we do not inted to be the playthings of others .
in this crisis in world history asia will necessarily play a vital role .
i hope that i may count on your cooperation in this important national work .
could you kindly favour me with your views on this subject ?
since then there have been discussions both among the political and other leaders in the country as also in the newspapers .
there was no doubt that there was a great necessity for the . starting of such an organisation .
i consider the fight against the suppression of civil liberties as part of the fight for independence .
the british government cares a great deal about world opinion . . . .
the honorary president of the indian union is dr . rabindranath tagore and it is not possible to get a better man than he for this post .
be is respected very greatly all the world over and is an international personality .
some people do not want to join the union for one reason or other .
someone has said that the starting of the civil liberties union is the second string to the congress bow .
i told him that the congress bow was a hefty bow and had many strings to it and many more would be added to it .
to suspect our motives is unfair .
education is worth nothing without civil liberty .
a big leader refused to join the civil liberties union because 1 attacked him or his group in my autobiography .
but strong criticism of one ' s views should not be taken as a personal attack .
one can strongly criticise the views of a certain person and yet be one of his best friends .
for a healthy and democratic growth of public life it is very essential that there should be strong and open criticism .
without discipline and responsibility in the individual or group , there is likely to be no true freedom .
this is regrettable but it is not difficult to understand , for it is the reaction from long continued suppression . . . .
no country in the world , excepting china , has this record .
what has been prohibited under section 19 of the sea customs act , i do not know .
that was bad enough .
these are extraordinary happenings , and in spite of the grave issues that confront the country , i should like to draw public attention to them .
if socialism and russia are contraband subjects then i am contraband too for i write frequently about them .
kitabistan have suffered a heavy loss by the seizure of many of their books by the police .
for i am supposed to be a well - behaved prisoner , a reputation which i have certainly done nothing to deserve .
so ends my sixth sentence , and i shall go out again into the wide world , but to what purpose ?
was it worth while , i wonder ?
but whether you care for them or not , you cannot grudge me the joy of having written them , day after day , during these two long years .
i do not want you to take all this for granted ; there may , indeed , be many errors in my accounts .
perhaps occasionally you may find my letters difficult to follow ; skip those parts , do not mind them .
the grown - up in me got the better of me sometimes , and i wrote as i should not have done .
if you would know the past you must look upon it with sympathy and with understanding .
it is easy to admire the beauties of the universe and to live in a world of thought and imagination .
thought , in order to justify itself , must lead to action .
if then we are the servants of thought we must be the servants of action . "
people avoid action often because they are afraid of the consequences , for action means risks and danger .
ramananda threw open the doors of his circle to all the four castes , men and women , and even to muslims .
his gifted disciple tulsidas used the magic of his poetry to win the hearts of millions of people for ram bhakti .
in fact god is to him not a concept but an experience beyond the grasp of the intellect .
according to kabir each of the contradictory concepts is true in its own way but each is incomplete , expressing only one aspect of the truth .
he strongly condemns the distinction of caste , colour and country .
how can you engage with it ?
science
how does the darwin centre fit into this ?
charles darwin is one of the most famous natural scientists in history .
why is the darwin centre named after him ?
sophisticated design techniques have been used in the construction of the darwin centre : what are they and why are they important ?
taxonomy
for science : storage
controlled temperature
the collections are stored at 13c .
though the alcohol preserves the specimens well , it is flammable and evaporates quickly .
for science :
our science is based on taxonomy and systematics .
these comprise describing , naming , and classifying nature , and studying its origins and inter - relationships .
this is the bedrock of the study of nature , a key science on which many others depend .
the darwin centre aims to extend our knowledge in order to help us manage our world .
we have completed the first phase of the darwin centre project .
phase two will build on the achievements of phase one and enhance the level of access available .
there will be greater opportunities for the public to interact with our scientists .
phase two is the subject of a 65 million fundraising campaign .
there are many threats to our biodiversity and environment .
what is the museum doing to combat them ?
there are not enough scientists studying biodiversity and helping to plan for its preservation .
the earth summit in rio in 1992 identified a major problem to be the shortage of trained taxonomists around the world .
ratification of the rio agreement placed an obligation on countries to study their biodiversity .
we are helping many governments around the world meet their obligations by participating in research projects with local scientists .
we must pass on our knowledge and skills by educating the next generation of taxonomists .
the museum plays an active part in education .
our public galleries , and the darwin centre itself , are an important part of this work .
we also participate in formal education .
with imperial college , we run an msc course on taxonomy , and supervise many phd students here and abroad .
without it , research in many other areas would grind to a halt .
part of our work is to raise awareness of the importance of taxonomy to science , both in the uk and abroad .
we work to raise awareness with governments and funding bodies , as well as the media and general public .
across the world , basic taxonomy is under - funded compared to other areas of science .
the museum aims to encourage greater recognition of this crucial science .
mixtures of traditional and modern techniques are used in identifying new specimens .
each new technique in taxonomy simply complements existing methods .
in this sense , taxonomy is unique among the sciences : old techniques remain important .
carefully collecting a few specimens of an abundant species will not damage populations of that species .
however , if that species is endangered , or rare , we will not collect any specimens , just information and images of it .
some areas of our collection are well developed , and simply do not need any more specimens .
for example , we have at least one of nearly every known mammal .
it is important to conserve what we already have in the collection , so that further collecting is minimised .
today the museum only takes specimens from the wild if there is a defined research need .
for example , we do not collect primates in the wild .
at any one time thousands of our specimens are on loan to other researchers , minimising their need to collect fresh material .
nearly all of our collecting is collaborative .
why do we keep them ?
we hold specimens from all over the world .
why is it important that we keep them here , as one set of collections ?
small pieces of things that were once living have no intrinsic value in themselves .
the specimens are of greater value within an organised , curated collection than isolated or dispersed across several places .
they are available for further research and are of greater use to researchers .
our collections are loaned to other institutions to be worked on by a wider range of researchers .
many science projects require researchers to compare different species from all over the world .
only a collection as large as the museum ' s has this kind of global reach and variety .
the museum aims to be a world leader in collection care .
as such , we can maintain the collections for their continued use in the future .
specimens face many threats , and are hard to look after .
in 1504 , after many ups and downs he conquered kabul , made it his capital and began to dream of conquering india .
ibrahim lodi , the nominal emperor , was hated by his nobles and his kinsmen .
the various religious communities are divine treasures entrusted to us by god . we must love them as such .
the eternal king showers his favours on all men without distinction .
kings who are shadows of god should never give up this principle .
under his all - embracing care everyone should find peace and happiness so that the benefits conferred by the shadow of god are universal .
akbar acted sincerely and consistently on this principle .
but even more significant was the edict issued in 1564 that no resident of india whatever his caste or creed , could be made a slave .
in akbar ' s time the sense of nationhood was still more limited .
other sanskrit books on mathematics and the natural sciences were rendered into persian by hindu translators .
it was a period of transition for persian poetry in india .
the verses of hindu poets are also marked by this dawning romanticism .
as for letter - writing as a literary art , it had become the preserve of hindu writers .
their paintings present nature , in its myriad moods and colours simply but effectively .
complex and abstract motifs were avoided .
the descendants of timur were great lovers of painting even before they came to india .
their pictures show some indian influence but the turco - iranian element prevails .
so he founded something like an academy of painting at his court where indian and persian artists worked together .
more emphasis was laid on superficial embellishment and decoration than on deeper artistic qualities .
no painting was regarded as complete without a broad gilt border covered with fine , elaborate decorative work .
aurangzeb ' s religious austerity proved very discouraging to the art of painting and after him it deteriorated with the decline of the mughal empire .
music is the medium in which the deepest human feeling and experience express themselves without the help of intellectual concepts .
aurangzeb ' s wars of conquest in the deccan emptied the treasury .
in the latter , hindu writers had an equal and in the former a larger share than muslim writers .
the numerous collections of literary epistles in persian written in this period are almost all by hindu munshis .
their command over a once foreign language is astonishing .
what is really unfortunate is that they follow the artificial and bombastic style of madho ram instead of the simple , chaste and racy diction of brahman or alamgir .
history and biography show the same increase in quantity and deterioration in quality .
works on philosophy , astrology , astronomy , mathematics and the other sciences sometimes show erudition but seldom originality .
in many fields the contribution of hindus is as important as that of muslims .
the numerous translations from sanskrit into persian were done exclusively by hindus .
in pure literature the glut of weird , extravagant romances which take the place of the epics of the time of akbar reflect the degenerations of taste .
the poetry of the period is also a sad comment on the intellectual and aesthetic decay which had set in .
the romanticism of urfi and naziri had lacked simplicity and realistic substance , but at least it had the force of passion and the freshness of imagination .
now bedil carried the subtlety of conceit and the extravagance of fantasy to such extremes that poetry was reduced to a kind of intellectual gymnastics .
accounts of indian life written by british or other europeans refer to a common hindustani culture along with regional and sectional cultures .
much of the imposing super - structure built during the time of akbar and his immediate successors was destroyed but the foundations were still intact .
at his instance ghulam hussain wrote the siyar - ul - muta - akhkhirin which is the most authoritative history of the eighteenth century .
its emphasis is on devotion , prayer and charity instead of austere self - restraint and self - culture .
there are three principles known as three jewels ( triratna ) : right faith , right knowledge and right conduct .
the jains share with the hindus the belief that the chain of karma can be broken by vigorous ascetic discipline and advocate self - mortification , even suicide .
a telegraph line began to operate between calcutta and bombay , madras and attock in 1854 .
the people of india had no opportunity yet to look into the spirit of western culture .
the only aspect of western civilisation which excited the wonder and admiration of the people in general was its technological progress represented by the railways , telegraph , etc .
they loved money and power but were to a large extent free from national and racial pride .
the centre of gravity of the state even during the reign of the muslim kings was inside the country .
but the state which the british now set up was in every way different from the traditional indian state .
as a matter of fact it was not a state at all but a subordinate administration without sovereign powers .
moreover he awakened in them the desire for political equality by conceding to them through the much disputed ilbert bill legal equality with europeans .
it was the impulse created by the violent controversy over this bill which led to the foundation of the indian national congress in 1885 .
of western art even indians educated in england had very little understanding and those educated in india did not have any comprehension at all .
artistic taste can only be cultivated through contact with circles of artists and connoisseurs .
in england they were beyond the reach . of indian students .
they wrote books on indian philosophy , religion , law , history and archaeology in english as well as in their own languages .
under their guidance the vernacular literatures were diverted from the field of pure fantasy to the observation and interpretation of actual life .
their bungalows were barrack - like large rooms surrounded with verandahs .
but it succeeded more in its unconscious than its conscious object .
what was more deplorable , in some cases this superficial imitation of english manners spoiled their morals .
similarly the imitation of the englishmen ' s self - confidence and self - assertion without their sense of proportion made them aggressive and bumptious .
on this educated class the british rulers had placed their hopes for spreading the new light .
but these hopes were not fulfilled .
they were completely cut off , not only from the illiterate masses , but also from old - fashioned people with purely oriental education .
they lived like strangers among their own people and were proud of it .
in the no - man ' s land between the east and west they were untroubled by patriotic feelings or national ties .
the only thing which distressed them was that the door of admittance into english society was shut to them .
in short , far from being eager to do their duty by their countrymen they were not even conscious of it .
they devoted themselves solely to the service of the foreign rulers .
the work of national service , education and reform they left to others .
its votaries were mainly those who owed their rise to the top level of society , to the patronage of the british government .
the latter group mainly consisted of orthodox religious leaders and their devoted followers .
this time the government was even more ruthless than before .
the latter fought the election with great success .
in five provinces the congress party won an absolute majority and in the rest was either the largest or second largest single party .
after hesitating for a few months it decided to work for the reforms in the provinces while opposing the reactionary scheme for the central government .
in five provinces it formed its own ministries and in two coalition ministries as the majority party .
in the history of the national congress taking the responsibility of government with limited powers was a fateful event which had a mixed result .
a considerable number of its former members seceded , some joining the leftist parties while most of the muslims went over to the muslim league .
in 1939 the congress party and its provincial governments were faced with the problem of taking an attitude to the second world war .
most members oscillated between these two points of view .
dominion status was promised after the war .
even if they did invade , indians fired with the spirit of independence , could resist by refusing to cooperate with them .
before the mahatma could see the viceroy and argue with him , he and all the prominent congress leaders were arrested and sent to prison .
the deplorable mob riots were crushed with even more deplorable ruth - lessness by the government and the peace of the graveyard reigned over india .
this can be attained by means of prayer and spiritual exercise .
but that is not what he is after .
but in those two systems knowledge does not mean intuitive but scientific knowledge based on observation , reasoning and experiment .
this brings us to the question of how indian muslims stand in relation to the national indian culture .
as with the muslims , the reactions both positive and negative of the hindu community to western culture were very strong .
its programme of social reform also was much more radical .
keshub chandra sen ' s influence aroused the spirit of religious and social reform in the educated hindus of bombay .
they started the prarthana samaj , more or less on the lines of the brahmo samaj .
mahadeo govind ranade was one of the greatest leaders of modern india .
he tried to infuse a new spirit of enlightenment in the hindus and was much more successful than syed ahmad khan had been with the muslims .
to them the nation meant the hindu community ; they regarded muslims as foreigners more or less like the british .
tilak began his public career at the age of twenty - four as the editor of the maratha and the kesari .
mahatma gandhi ' s political activity was only an off - shoot of his larger missionthe spiritual and moral regeneration of humanity .
his spiritual experience had revealed to him absolute reality in the form of truth .
so the pursuit of truth was to him the ultimate moral value .
the greatest obstacle in the way to truth is uncontrolled passion of every kind , which mahatma gandhi expresses by the general term ' violence ' .
so he made one of the main tasks of his life the welding of ' muslim nationalism ' and ' hindu nationalism ' into the common indian nationhood .
he knew that in the history of india cultural harmony above all meant religious harmony .
in his prayer - meetings which were attended mainly by hindus he included in the liturgy two surahs from the quran , as also some verses of the bible .
on account of this fatal fight mahatma gandhi ' s success in his great object , though phenomenal , was not complete .
this is a poet ' s task whose mind is the mirror of his age and whose voice the voice of his people .
fortunately we have had two such poets in our time , tagore among the hindus and iqbal among the muslims .
according to him the physical world is a phenomenon of the absolute and as such has merely a relative existence .
but this is an illusion , maya .
self and non - self , man and the physical world , are two aspects of ) the same absolute reality ; one is active , the other passive .
the physical world is the field in which the self exercises its spiritual force .
this force expresses itself not in a struggle but in an intimate relation with the physical world .
" when a man does not realise his kinship with the world , he lives in a prison - house whose walls are alien to him .
iqbal ' s conception of the universe like that of absolute reality is derived partly from the quran and partly from modern vitalistic philosophy .
we shall give only two illustrations .
next to love and devotion to god , human affection is regarded as the highest virtue by both hindus and muslims .
altruism , service , and hospitality often expose good men to unscrupulous exploitation by wastrels or rogues .
another set of virtues to which hindus and muslims in india attach much greater value than perhaps any other people , are temperance , modesty and chastity .
even more striking is the uniformity of social , specially family life , of the hindus and muslims .
the family life of both communities shows exactly the same pattern .
most of them are faced with the prospect of starvation because the avenues of employment are already overcrowded .
this feeling is fraught with danger for the cultural unity and progress of the country , and all reasonable efforts should be made to remove it .
there is a greater possibility of some of them becoming the tools of subversive forces inside the country .
but this national culture has to aim , not at absolute uniformity , but at a perfect harmony of a variety of regional and sectional cultures .
the question of the official and national language , particularly , gave rise to grave differences .
it seemed that our national unity instead of growing stronger was in danger of becoming weaker .
the raising of the language controversy , immediately after independence , was full of peril but it could not be avoided .
the first of these commissions was appointed in 1954 and submitted its report in 1956 .
linguistic fanaticism is subsiding and the people appear inclined to solve their language problems in a spirit of understanding and compromise .
these teachers will prove , like the fellows of the national academies , to be the makers as well as the messengers of a national culture .
along with the promotion of economic progress , sanitation and education , the propagation of art and culture should be given a place in our rural development projects .
the aristocratic view developed during the feudal age was that culture was the expression of the special values of the higher classes of society .
it was their creation and they alone could enjoy it .
they constitute an indivisible whole .
according to this theory therefore , it would be a gross fallacy to suppose that they can be developed piecemeal or independently of one another .
to give practical shape to his concept of education gandhiji sought the help of educational experts .
the government of india also accepted with some reservations the scheme of basic education and wanted all primary education to be gradually remodelled on this pattern .
let us wait and see how far they succeed with the scanty resources at their disposal .
so they have to strike a balance between the static and the dynamic , the old and the new .
this is the real issue which has to be faced in the ultimate analysis .
only a small section of the population like the worshippers of kali continued to observe it .
one of these , current in the middle regions of north india , had developed on a logical pattern and was called sanskrit .
as the language of hindu religion and philosophy it was studied by the upper classes throughout india .
astrology , which had begun from the study of the movements of stars for determining the time of religious rites and sacrifices was the special preserve of brahmins .
buddhism exercised a great influence on education during this age .
before the buddha the language of science and religion was sanskrit .
education , therefore , was confined exclusively to these high castes .
the world also will survive the horror of to - day and build itself anew on fresh foundations .
i spoke of political and economic issues and judging from my speech i was full of politics and elections .
when i read spengler i disliked him .
and yet i found a certain fascination in his enormous survey of human activity .
but when it comes to real intimacy the circle narrows down tremendously .
i am " not a good enough economist to have a definite opinion about the fine points of communist economic doctrine .
the buddha adopted for the propagation of his message the language of common intercourse instead of sanskrit .
in those days the language spoken in the homeland of the buddha was the eastern dialect of indo - aryan .
it was in this dialect that the buddha preached .
by the time of asoka it had become the religious language of the buddhists , and spread along with buddhism throughout india .
that is why asoka used it in his edicts carved on pillars in different parts of the country .
as far as knowledge is concerned , the buddhists generally confined themselves to the study of religious lore .
the field of learning continued to be under the sway of the brahmins throughout the period .
on the other hand , art flourished under buddhist patronage .
in the pre - buddhist period fine arts were in a primitive stage .
this appeared in the november number of the modern review of calcutta .
the title is used for the president of the congress .
at that time there was some talk of my being re - elected president for another year .
it struck me one day to play a little trick .
in this article i considered judiciously my virtues and gave praise for them in full measure .
cooperated in international actions to send help to republican spain during civil war - and arranged for indian medical mission to visit china .
visited barcelona in june 1938 , saw air raids .
czechoslovakia during sudeten crisis in summer 1938 .
visited chungking ( china ) in august - sept . 1939 .
intimately connected with reform movements in indian feudal states ; president of indian states ' people ' s conference since 1939 .
national planning committee arrested on oct . 31 , 1940 and sentenced to 4 years r . i . for certain political speeches .
but the right means might well be beyond the capacity of infirm and selfish human nature .
what then was one to do ?
a kind of vague humanism appealed to me .
there is an infinite number , of factors and relations all of which influence and determine events in varying degrees .
and so while i accepted the fundamentals of the socialist theory , i did not trouble myself about its numerous inner controversies .
in the solution of these problems the way of observation and precise knowledge and deliberate reasoning , according to the method of science , must be followed .
let us , therefore , not rule out intuition and other methods of sensing truth and reality .
they are necessary even for the . purposes of science .
a living philosophy must answer the problems of today .
we cannot escape from that prison or get rid entirely of that illusion , if illusion it is .
space - time and the quantum theory utterly changed the picture of the physical world .
man no longer sees nature as something apart and distinct from himself .
human destiny appears to become a part of nature ' s rhythmic energy .
science may be on the verge of discovering vital mysteries , which yet may elude it .
still it will go on along its appointed path , for there is no end to its journeying .
' what else is wisdom ?
i do n ' t propose to defend myself or take any formal part in this trial .
it is because ' i am not particularly interested in these legal proceedings .
i have prepared a statement which i wish to read out to you now or at a later stage .
after reading it out , i shall hand it over to the court and it need not be recorded by the court in writing .
for only they can sense life who stand often on the verge of it , only they whose lives are not governed by the fear of death .
nicoli ostrovsky )
but by the second century bc their influence began to decline .
this new culture which had begun to develop about 200 bc reached its highest level in the fourth century under the gupta emperors .
in the following pages we will try to give a brief survey of this new culture .
there was also the emotional element in it , the learning from crowds , . the appreciation of mass psychology .
may be it is a relief and an escape from human folly , human cowardice and human knavery !
i feel more in tune with nature .
i notice the sensitive growing tip of a creeper plant , how full of life and energy it is !
it surprises me more and more how people go through life with their eyes shut to its varied beauty as well as its terrible misery .
which reminds me of a bright little poem which might interest you .
it is a modern poem i forget the name of the author .
this letter is not meant to be sent to you in the ordinary course and i do not know when you will see it .
i do not know when you will come to interview me again .
probably i would still have written to you but you were out of reach and expected every moment to leave england for india .
and yet this business of censorship is no new thing , although jail and c . d . ( civil disobedience ) aggravate it tenfold .
even during the slack periods , politically speaking , some kind of censorship always continued .
but when it came to personal mattters it was a different story .
especially this was so in the last few chapters dealing with my personal life .
it was impossible for me to lay bare my heart before anybody , much less before the world at large .
but these last six years since the autobiography was written have had a powerful effect upon me .
i have survived all this , hardened , matured , call it what you will .
i am not just one and fifty years old .
but i feel as if i was hundreds of years old in mind and the weight of these centuries lies heavily upon me .
it seems rather silly to say so and the expression is a trite one , but throughout our married life i was very much in love with her .
neither of these facts lead to a man ' s love for a woman .
my conception of marriage and sex may strike you as odd ; they certainly differ from yours .
india grows upon me more and more and i am ever discovering something new in her .
it is a voyage of discovery which has no end .
and yet people call me , because of my ways and outlook , a european and an englishman .
they are right in a way and yet only superficially so .
i do believe intensely in india , though it would be hard to define this belief .
i have never yet been disappointed in the common people of india perhaps because i did not expect too much - from them .
their vulgarity and weaknesses and limited outlook appal me .
it is not a matter for cheering .
they were brave men , strong men .
the situation had not developed sufficiently and they thought in a particular manner .
the peasant was shaken up and he began to emerge from his quiescent shell .
we learnt our indian economics more from these visits than from books and learned discourses .
gandhi held strong views on economic , social , and other matters .
he refused to narrow his cultural inheritance .
' indian culture ' , he wrote , ' is neither hindu , islamic , nor any other , wholly .
i refuse to live in other peoples ' houses as an interloper , a beggar , or a slave . '
influenced by modern thought currents , he never let go of his roots and clung to them tenaciously .
even religion , as everything else , took second place to his passion to raise these submerged people . . . .
at no time , even when its fortunes were low , did congress surrender to superior might or submit to foreign authority .
it remained the symbol of india ' s passionate desire for independence and her will to resist alien domination .
so long therefore as the world is not perfect , a healthy society must have the seeds of revolt in it .
it must alternate between revolution and consideration .
i shall welcome your agreement with me but that would mean little if it has not been preceded by thought and conviction .
reject utterly what i say to you if you think it is wrong .
for " religions " as the chinese say , " are many , but reason is one " .
what do we find in this world of ours today ?
yet it was clear that only by collective action could the aggressor be stayed and peace maintained .
the british government has a special responsibility for the growth of fascism and thus for bringing war nearer .
this act of gross betrayal and dishonour did not even bring peace , but has brought us to the threshold of war .
in 1857 a bloody rebellion took place and it was suppressed in a ghastly manner .
another rebellion against the dominating authority took shape , a peaceful one , discarding all methods of violence , but more powerful and widespread than any previous one .
india ' s freedom and independence were the prerequisites for us in order to play our part in the larger world .
none of these was told or asked for its opinion .
the air resounded with loud cries invoking freedom and asserting the sanctity of democracy .
he was the predecessor of kalidas who lived in the fourth or the fifth century bc .
kalidasa is unanimously acknowledged to be the king of indian dramatists and poets .
at the end of the seventh century appeared another great dramatist , bhavabhuti whom literary critics place in the same class as kalidas .
his three plays malatimadhava , mahavircharita and uttararamacharita are regarded to be memorable works of the golden age of sanskrit literature .
in epic poetry , as in drama , the indian mind reached the heights of perfection during this period .
bharavi was almost a contemporary of kalidasa .
only one epic of his , kiratarjunia , has come down to us but it is regarded to be the most powerful poem in the sanskrit language .
this freedom of india must be the symbol of the prelude to the freedom of all other asiatic nations .
that sanction was to take effect only when gandhiji so decided .
finally it was stated that the committee had ' no intention of gaining power for the congress .
the resolution was finally passed late in the evening of august 8th 1942 .
many universities were closed .
some of the local leaders attempted even then to pursue peaceful methods of action and civil disobedience , but this was difficult in the prevailing atmosphere .
the tragedy of the two great wars is over but the tragedy of the seeming peace pursues us and darkens the horizon .
he was president of the all india states people ' s conference which met at udaipur from 30 december 1945 to 4 january 1946 .
the extracts are from his presidential address , 30 december 1945 , which was printed in the hindustan times , 31 december 1945 .
this is the way imperialism still functions in asia .
it is the way of revolting cruelty and brutality and frightfulness and a complete denial of the right to freedom .
in siam , britain wants to extend her imperial influence .
in malaya , she is consolidating her economic hold and extending it .
in burma and ceylon she intends to hold on as long as she can .
it is well known that princes with advanced or independent views are not favoured by the political department of the government of india .
in dealing with the states , therefore , we deal with the british government in another guise .
their disappearance and absorption would , of course , be inevitable if britain ever ceased to be the supreme power as regards india . "
the direction is towards the people .
and so no man can say what the future of the princes will be .
only those of us who fit in with changing conditions can find a suitable place in that future .
ultimately it will be for the people of india to decide this as other problems .
our future ultimately depends on the strength , cohesion and unity of our people .
we have had to face formidable obstacles which have often prevented us from reaching our people .
but those obstacles gradually fade away and our united strength grows .
in this , as in some other matters , we must learn the lesson of unity which the indian national army has so well demonstrated .
but we have to remember that even now there are some states so backward and reactionary as to prevent the functioning of the people ' s organizations .
among those is hyderabad where for many years past the state congress has been under a ban .
it is a little absurd to think of major changes when these primary rights are denied to our people .
also reports reach us continually of oppression and suppression in many states .
conditions in state prisons are particularly bad and the lot of political prisoners deplorable .
of the many martyrs to our cause i should like to mention especially the name of shri deva suman of tehri state .
many of us will remember this brave and earnest youth who worked for the freedom of the people of the states .
he was practically done to death by the treatment given to him in prison by the state authorities .
we have big work ahead .
let us set about it with all the strength and earnestness we possess .
my heart bled when i read reports of the mounting death toll .
the r . i . nn episode has opened an altogether new chapter in the history of the armed forces of india .
during the second world war , nearly 20 to 25 lakhs of our boys enlisted themselves in the army , the navy and the air force .
during the war they submitted to . discriminations and humiliations to which they were subjected .
he has seen many changes in foreign countries and these changes have profoundly affected and influenced his outlook .
though he is still a member of the fighting services under the aegis of the british government in india , his patriotism has been aroused .
the present unrest among the defence services has direct bearing on the indian body politic .
during the last three years there have been strikes and refusal to work by servicemen in england , but in india conditions are different .
when conditions in india improve and a free government is established their demands will be dealt with .
the only thing that is not correct is that they were not fighting against heavy odds .
i can sympathise with you if you have been compelled to hoist the union jack on your own buildings .
when things settle down and we are in power the grievances of the servicemen will have to be inquired into .
why are the armed forces doing all this ?
the armed forces have come to realise their own responsibilities towards their country and the people .
at the stroke of the midnight hour , when the world sleeps , india will awake to life and freedom .
we end today a period of ill fortune and india discovers herself again .
are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future ?
freedom and power bring responsibility .
the responsibility rests upon this assembly , a sovereign body representing the sovereign people of india .
it means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity .
and so we have to labour and to work , and work hard , to give reality to our dreams .
this is no time for petty and destructive criticism , no time for ill will or blaming others .
i beg to move , sir ,
but great as has been the political achievement of the last decade , no less remarkable has been the growth of the labour movement in india .
none of us can call our trade union movement today strong or ready for successful battle .
but who can deny that during a few short years we have covered ground which it took generations in other countries to traverse ?
if he has weakened , it has , not unoften , been due to the weakness of his leaders .
it is the system that is wrong , the system that is based on the exploitation of the few and the prostitution of labour .
it will not profit you much if there is a change in your masters and your miseries continue .
you want a living wage and not a dying wage .
we are often accused of preaching the class war and of widening the distance between the classes .
but those who accuse us are singularly unseeing and ignorant of what goes on around them .
the class war has existed and exists today .
only by our removing the causes are we likely to bring peace .
these will bring only some little relief but we cannot refuse anything that brings some comfort to the unhappy worker .
but we cannot at the same time work for such petty relief or compromise on them .
for us the objective can only be a new order under which the worker will have true freedom and opportunity of growth .
the programme was part of the notes made during his imprisonment in central prison , naini , sometime after 21 december 1930 .
they must have the ultimate ideal clear - cut in their minds .
but after all the whole lot of them taken together are a handful onlyunder seven lakhs in a population of probably over four crores in agra province .
they are tenants or landless labourers or the unemployed .
at this stage it is not possible to outline on behalf of the congress a definite economic and agrarian programme .
a tentative agrarian programme is suggested below .
this is not from a purely socialistic , standpoint but from a congress viewpoint with some leanings towards socialism .
in particular , the congress is opposed to big zamindars and considers them most harmful to the social order .
how does socialism fit in with the present ideology of the congress ?
we require this enormous system of planning and only socialism can provide it .
how can socialism come to this country ?
we cannot make a country socialist by passing laws .
laws are necessary to make the path clear .
but we have to build up the state .
this policy is by no means a final policy or an ideal one .
but it represents what can be attempted and done under present conditions and within a relatively short period of time .
this means that before a trade dispute develops into open conflict there must be an intermediate stage of negotiation or arbitration .
in india it sometimes leads to communal violence which diverts attention immediately from labour ' s demands .
labour , above everything , cannot afford to be communal or to encourage communalism .
towards the end of 1938 a national planning committee was constituted at the instance of the congress .
hard - headed big business was there as well as people who are called idealists and doctrinaires , and socialists and near - communists .
it was a strange assortment of different types and it was not clear how such an odd mixture would work .
there were not enough data for real planning and few statistics were available .
probably i was too optimistic .
especially as in the " political sphere there was conflict enough for us and , in the future , there might well be unstable conditions .
a general consent for a plan was thus of great value .
two interesting decisions were made in connection with education .
if . this authority is powerless or is circumscribed and restricted and its activities limited , it cannot plan .
it follows , therefore , that the national authority which plans must also have full power to give effect to its planning .
an essential prerequisite for planning is thus complete freedom and independence for the country and the removal of outside control .
it is not even possible to draw up a plan on any other basis .
our plan for national development must , therefore , be drawn up for a free and independent india .
this does not mean that we must wait for independence before doing anything towards the development of planned economy .
all such efforts , however , must be directed towards the realisation of the plan we have drawn up for a free india .
this should be the background of foundation of our plan .
the congress has , in view of the present conditions in india , laid great stress on the encouragement of cottage industries in india .
any planning must therefore take note of this fact and base itself on it .
here , in india , a premature conflict on class lines would lead to a break - up and possibly to prolonged inability to build anything .
the disruptive forces in the country seem to be growing in strength and it almost seems that we are going the way of china .
it becomes vitally necessary for us to be clear about our policy and our methods , to define with precision our attitude to national and international problems .
we live in the post - munich age and the map changes from day to day and barbarism and black reaction triumph .
even as i write my mind is filled with that supreme tragedy of our timethe murder of spanish democracy .
this is the world we live in .
about two months after the tripuri congress , bose resigned from congress presidentship .
communalism becomes even more definitely the citadel of the reactionary and the bulwark of imperialism .
but crises and deadlocks when they occur have at least this advantage , that they force us to think .
it is for this reason that i am venturing to put forward some thoughts and experiences of mine .
it may be that this way will show itself sooner than people imagine .
meanwhile it might be worthwhile for me to trace the various tendencies that have developed in india during the last three years . . . ,
if this is so during more or less normal periods , still more is gandhiji ' s guidance necessary when crisis approaches .
thus we arrive at the conclusion that the full cooperation of this modernist group is also essential for the successful functioning of the congress . .
if bona fide cooperation between the two groups is lacking , it is difficult to think in terms of a struggle against the common opponent . . . .
the congress cannot obviously be treated as a sectarian group .
it represents the nation and its doors are open to all who believe in its objective and its methods .
i think we shall be able to turn these vital currents in the right direction and mould them on scientific lines . . . .
unless this is done , you cannot go far . . . .
we have done well when we have hardly tapped the talent in india .
today , of course , we have tapped only less than one per cent of our talent .
iv religion , culture and communal politics
almost always it seems to stand for blind belief and reaction , dogma and bigotry , superstition and exploitation , and the preservation of vested interests .
and yet i knew well that there was something else in it , something which supplied a deep inner craving of human beings .
how else could it have been the tremendous power it has been and brought peace and comfort to innumerable tortured souls ?
but organised religion , whatever its past may have been , today is very largely an empty form devoid of real content .
probably to no two persons will the same complex of ideas and images arise on hearing or reading this word .
even these words are vague enough , but they have a much more limited range than ' religion ' .
what then is religion ( to use the word in spite of its obvious disadvantages ) ?
what that direction is will again be a matter for debate .
there can be no doubt that this inner development powerfully influences the outer environment .
but it is equally obvious that the outer environment powerfully influences the inner development .
that is one of the delusions with which we try to comfort ourselves and try to overcome our feeling of inferiority .
it may be that individuals can rise above circumstances and environment and reach great inner heights .
but for large groups and nations a certain measure of external development is essential before the inner evolution can take place .
a class that is downtrodden and exploited can never progress inwardly .
thus even for inner development external freedom and a suitable environment become necessary .
" no man can live without religion , " gandhiji has written somewhere .
" there are some who in the egotism of their reason declare that they have nothing to do with religion .
but that is like a man saying that he breathes , but that he has no nose . "
it is obvious that he is using it in a sense probably moral and ethical more than any other different from that of the critics of religion .
religions have helped greatly in the development of humanity .
philosophy has avoided many of these pitfalls and encouraged thought and inquiry .
science ignored the ultimate purposes and looked at fact alone .
the more we understand life and nature , the less we look for supernatural causes .
whatever we can understand and control ceases to be a mystery .
gradually they have passed out of its control and become subjects for scientific study .
the final mysteries still remain far beyond the reach of the human mind and are likely to continue to remain so .
it is therefore with the temper and approach of science , allied to philosophy , and with reverence for all that lies beyond , that we must face life .
external events and their consequence affect us powerfully , and yet the greatest shocks come to our minds through inner fears and conflicts .
and nalure has had its revenge on us .
like our old architecture , our faith has lost its ancient purity and simplicity and has been covered up with a mass of abuses and crude symbols and orientation .
today the keepers of our consciences are men , narrow and bigoted and with no knowledge of anything except empty forms and ceremonials .
above all we must gel rid of the gross abuses that have crept into us and threaten to poison our whole system .
if we cannot conquer these weaknesses of ours then we sink deeper and deeper into the morass and perish .
but i feel that we can and will survive .
a great deal is being said now about the strengthening and purification of hinduism as practised today .
every person , whether he is a hindu or not , must welcome any such movement in the interests of a wider culture and human progress .
we must therefore welcome the movement to broaden the basis of hinduism and to rid it of its abuses .
but i have noted with sorrow that the motive force behind it is not so much the good of hinduism as the distrust and fear of the mussulmans .
no great movement of reform ever flourished if it was based on fear and fed on hatred .
fear and distrust will multiply and will call out their sister qualities in the other community .
gradually india will be converted into armed camps and every man ' s hand will be raised against his brother .
i believe in giving full liberty to every man to adopt the faith of his choice .
but the present shuddhi movement , so far as i understand it , is based on different reasons and is proceeding on undesirable lines .
and instead of peace and harmony it has created hatred and distrust and bitterness .
toleration has almost ceased to exist and the best of us are not free from ignoble suspicion .
but today it stands in need of a reminder .
most of them would mention the names of chenghiz khan and timur and mahmud of ghazni as examples of muslim tyrants .
i wonder how many know that chenghiz khan was not even a mohammedan ?
the recommendation was accepted and vast numbers were brutally expelled .
" did our victorious ancestors ever once attempt to extirpate christianity out of spain when it was in their power ?
did they not suffer your forefathers to enjoy the free use of their rites at the same time that they wore their chains ?
it was a struggle for jobs for the middle - class intelligentsia .
the conflict between the two was therefore often economic , but it was always given a communal colouring .
it was quite extraordinary to see . the close association of the aga khan and his group with lord lloyd and his party . '
they went a step further , and made pacts with the representatives of the european association and others at the r . t . c .
this was very depressing , for this association has been and is , in india , the stoutest and the most aggressive opponent of indian freedom .
the muslims had at least spoken with dignity , the hindu communalists did not even possess this .
on both sides every effort is made to suppress and avoid the consideration of economic issues .
latterly there has been an intersting development in the speaches and statements of some of the muslim communal leaders .
the - muslim nation in indiaa nation within a nation , and not even compact , but vague , spread out , indeterminate .
politically , the idea is absurd , economically it is fantastic ; it is hardly worth considering .
and yet it helps us a little to understand the mentality behind it .
this was the beginning of extra - territoriality which , in more recent times , became such a nightmare to many eastern countries .
the day of even national cultures is rapidly passing - and the world is becoming one cultural unity .
there are certainly many differences between the traditional hindu and muslim philosophies of life .
sir syed ahmad khan made his choice on behalf of the indian muslims when he started the aligarh college .
but what is this ' muslim ' culture ' ?
is it a kind of racial memory of the great deeds of the arabs , persians , turks , etc . ?
or art and music ?
or customs ?
i find a tiny handful of middle - class muslims as well as hindus in north india influenced by the persian language and traditions .
as a matter of fact , even these distinctions are largely urban and they tend to disappear .
but it is not the beautiful that these people clutch at , but something that is seldom worth while and is often harmful . . . .
it would have been preaching to the converted , as the average hindu is well aware of them .
it is far more difficult to see one ' s own fault than to see the failings of others .
the leaders of these organizations are patently and intensely communal .
the speakers further pointed out " the impracticability of ever governing india through anything but a british agency " .
i do not think that these statements represent the views of muslims generally or even of most of the communally inclined muslims .
essentially , this is an attitude of pure reaction political , cultural , national , social .
personally i think that it is generally possible to cooperate with communalists provided the political objective is the same .
the greatest lesson that history teaches us is that nothing remains static .
all the time there is expansion , contraction , revolt and upsurge .
any race that tried to escape change and immobilize itself became a prisoner caught up in its own trap and decayed .
in the olden days when distances were very great and travelling was difficult , countries differed .
in the modern world , trains , cars and aeroplanes have almost abolished boundaries and built world unity .
books , newspapers , the telegraphs , radio , and cinema influence us and gradually change our ideas .
we may like them or not , there is no escape from them .
they should , therefore , be understood and mastered .
i want to know from bhaiji what is the stand of our old hinduism on all these matters ?
he talks about religion and caste civilisations .
again , who are the muslims ?
apparently only those who follow mr . jinnah and the muslim league .
when maulana mohamed ali joined the congress , mr . jinnah tells us that he fought against the muslims .
it was a small matter that thousands of muslims were members of the congress then and millions sympathised and cooperated with it .
all this seems to me extraordinary and harmful doctrine and most unjust to the muslims .
they bear no relation whatever to modern conditions and modern problems , which are essentially economic and political .
they did not ask me about the communal problem or percentages or separate electorates .
the congress welcomes all cooperation ; it has repeatedly stressed the need for a joint front against imperialism .
just then the procession arrived at the town hall and for some reason or other started stone throwing .
and then , after the six months were over ?
in some instances the person who ventured to bring a breach to a court , himself got into trouble for his pains and was fined .
what were we doing all this time ?
we were in prison .
for six years now we have been mostly in prison , sometimes as many as sixty or seventy thousand at a time .
the muslims deserve their full share in this victory .
most of us had thought that the child - wife evil was largely confined to hindus .
lest it be said that our enlightened indian states lag behind on this issue , the government of mysore has recently made its position clear .
a venturesome member sought to introduce a child marriage restraint bill , on the lines of the sarda act , in the mysore council .
religion was again saved .
nearly twenty two years ago , before the war , in january , 1914 , the aga khan wrote an article in the edinburgh review on the indian situation .
now the separation between society and state , between the khalifa and the community was complete .
he ruled with the help of his army , not with the goodwill of the people .
the separatist tendency in the political field was reflected in cultural life .
so the islamic state and islamic culture in the strict sense lasted only for about half a century under the prophet and the four righteous khalifas .
as traders they had probably started coming to south india much earlier .
the urdu script has to remain as it is , though some slight simplification of it might be attempted .
it might easily absorb the sindhi script , which is very similar to it . . . .
let us consider hindustani both as the mother tongue of the north and central india and as an all - india language .
the two aspects are different and must be dealt with separately .
hindi and urdu are the two main aspects of this language .
obviously they have the same basis , the same grammar , the same fund of ordinary words to draw upon .
to consider hindi as the language of the hindus and urdu as that of the muslims is absurd .
urdu , except for its script , is of the very soil of india and has no place outside india .
it is even today the home language of large numbers of hindus in the north .
it was in the second half of the nineteenth century that the words hindi and urdu began to signify something different from each other .
there was talk of hindustani not only as the language of northern and central india , but as the national language of the whole country .
it is well to bear this in mind , for only then shall we understand what the root cause of the evil is .
scratch a separatist in language and you will invariably find that he is a communalist , and very often a political reactionary .
round about the court and camp many persian words were current , and these crept into the language .
hindi is , of course , spoken also in the towns , but urdu is almost entirely an urban language .
every other way will be a superficial way without lasting effect .
languages change organically when the people who speak them change .
in written literary productions it is formidable , and this has led some people to believe that some evil - minded persons are the cause of it .
this divergence , though unfortunate in itself , is really a sign of healthy growth .
both hindi and urdu , after a long period of stagnation , have woken up and are pushing ahead .
they are struggling to give expression to new ideas and leaving the old ruts for new forms of literary expression .
the beam in one ' s own eye is not seen , the mote in the other ' s eye is obvious enough .
and yet this fear is unjustified and there is no reason for alarm .
we must welcome the new life that is coursing through both hindi and urdu , even though it might lead to a temporary widening of the gulf .
why should either be jealous of the other ?
thus apparently the two variations of the language drift apart .
circumstances are too strong for them and a mass audience will demand both simplicity and uniformity .
but we must not waste our efforts in objecting to this growth of the language even though that growth may exhibit separatist tendencies .
so the richer they get the better .
swaraj will not be a hindu or muslim raj , but will be a raj for all without distinction of caste , creed or community .
black marketeers and profiteers have reaped a rich harvest when thirty five lakhs of people died of starvation .
the condition of the workers is also the worst .
this happens because we are not free .
the british government wants to rule by dividing the people .
we must unite to ' frustrate this game .
they both stand for india ' s slavery and perpetuation of the british raj .
when muhammad ghori died , qutubuddin aibak became the independent ruler of the kingdom in india , which came to be known as the sultanate of delhi .
the establishment of the delhi sultanate was an epoch - making event in the history of india .
for the first time in 500 years after the death of harsha , india now had a fair degree of political unity .
though the new rulers were foreigners they made india their home .
then alone can the indians achieve freedom .
it is the common people who will have to snatch power from british hands . . . .
i , therefore , request all , hindus and muslims , to unite and increase your strength as early as possible .
hindus and muslims have lived together for thousands of years and they will continue to live so .
therefore , the task of strengthening their brotherly bonds is the most essential thing . .
in the nineteen - twenties it began to take some interest in foreign affairs .
the triumphs of the chinese revolution were hailed with enthusiasm as portents of the approaching freedom of india and of the elimination of european aggression in asia .
it was with this background that the national congress began to develop its foreign policy in 1927 .
no individual or organization in india opposed it .
japanese aggression in manchuria produced even stronger reactions because of sympathy for china .
but this coming war was likely to be different from the one that had been envisaged before hitler had arisen .
war between england and germany became probable , and if this broke out what then would our policy be ?
how would we reconcile the two dominating trends of our policy : opposition to british imperialism and opposition to fascism and nazism ?
those feelings continued but i do not know of any other nationalist movement which has been so free from hatred .
his nationalism , therefore , had a certain world outlook and was entirely free from any aggressive intent .
let that be our nationalism . ' and again : ' i do want to think in terms of the whole world .
my patriotism includes the good of mankind in general .
we in india have felt the full weight of imperialism .
right through their stay there they have adopted the old policy of " divide and rule " .
i regret to say that that policy is still very much in evidence .
also perhaps you know of what is called the indian mutiny , which took place 70 years ago .
we read in history , not only ancient but even fairly recent history , of the riches of india .
however , as we shall see , the attempt to make the delhi sultanate an islamic state even in this limited sense did not ' succeed .
it only had the unfortunate result of preventing the political unity of india from taking the shape of a new national unity .
but the very fact of hindus and muslims living together had begun the process of cultural understanding which bore fruit after three centuries .
scholars , saints , poets , generals , statesmen were attracted by delhi as iron filings by a magnet .
so the founders of the sultanate had no time to think what form they should give to the new state .
not only in relation to the khilafat but in other respects also the islamic character of the delhi sultanate was no more than a fiction .
in most other matters they had to follow the shariah as interpreted by the fuqaha ( doctors of islamic law ) .
the concession of fifty per cent granted by islam to muslim cultivators does not seem to have ever been given by the delhi sultans .
the islamic law of inheritance was not strictly enforced .
in short , the delhi - sultanate was not an islamic state even in the limited sense in which this word is used for other medieval muslim states .
from the point of view of national unity it was a period of utter disintegration .
among the rajputs the tribal spirit was so strong as to lead to unending feuds .
nobody could work for the unity of india in such an atmosphere .
the powerful raja of kanauj did not join it and no more than a small fraction of india ' s power of resistance was used .
the establishment of the delhi sultanate produced the same feeling among the hindus as the conquests of the gurjars and huns had done .
the term malechcha , originally coined for the gurjars and huns was now used for muslims .
of course , interference with the dharmashastra in the field of religious and personal law would have been intolerable to the hindus .
moreover , they were in practice , though not in theory , discriminated against in the matter of state service .
mohammad tughlaq was the first ruler who pursued a conciliatory policy towards the hindus .
by the end of this period , under sikandar lodi and sher shah suri specially , religious discrimination in state service had practically disappeared .
hindus had begun to learn persian , the court language , and to get some of the biggest and most responsible posts .
this tremendous background of toleration and culture is a precious inheritance for us .
above all we should try to combine freedom and civil liberty with discipline and responsibility .
the acceptance of office in the provinces does not vary this policy , and indeed much has already been done to give effect to it .
governments all over the world are not known to be particularly competent in giving such decisions , and official censors are not an attractive crowd .
it cannot be the policeman ' s approach which has been so characteristic of the british government in india , the method of force and violence and coercion .
they will win the public to their side and thus create an atmosphere which is not favourable to wrong action .
but long before hindus became reconciled to the muslim rulers their relations with the common muslims had improved considerably .
the hindus found their ideas very similar to those of vedantic philosophy and were naturally attracted by them .
quite a large number of hindus embraced islam and , even those who did not were now better disposed towards the muslims .
another great force which created a general atmosphere of religious harmony between the hindus and the muslims was the bhakti movement .
but now came these contraband books to be introduced into india ?
they came openly through the post or as parcels and successfully passed the customs barriers , in spite of the government notification .
along with mystical experience as the basis of religion he greatly emphasised moral action .
but unfortunately pure mystical experience is not enough to constitute a religion .
so these religious movements soon crystallised into separate sects with all the adjuncts of positive religions .
still , this does not mean that their efforts were wasted .
they could not merge the currents of hinduism and islam on the surface , but they showed that the springs which feed them do meet somewhere below it .
they created an atmosphere of religious harmony in india which was not to be seen anywhere else in the middle ages .
in india , during this period painting seems to have been discouraged by the muslims but indian music captured their hearts .
ibrahim adil shah , the king of bijapur , was a great connoisseur of music and wrote a book on the subject , nauras .
the muslim sufis adored music .
the conception of a building born in the mind of a muslim king could not be unaffected by the indian environment .
further , when it was designed and executed by a hindu architect it was recast in the mould of the hindu mind .
moreover , the decorative work shows the direct influence of the north indian hindu and jain styles .
the muslim states which had seceded from delhi adopted this style with local modifications more in keeping with the hindu styles .
in their small spheres their rulers were nearer to the people and understood and respected their feelings and desires .
at the instance of husain shah , maladhar vasu translated the bhagwat gita into bengali .
his name is honoured and loved not only by history but in legends known to every child in kashmir .
he got many sanskrit books translated into persian so that muslims could study the hindu religion and the ancient indian culture .
he was a great patron of the arts and crafts , specially of music , and great musicians from distant lands were attracted to his court .
babur was the descendant of two great conquerors .
the ornamental effect was largely achieved by beautiful designs worked in a mosaic of multicoloured stones .
the persian language , which was its medium of expression , spread during this period to new regions .
much more important as an educative influence during this period than the establishment of a few colleges was the introduction of the printing press and newspapers .
the commercial mentality of the bulk of this society had no other values than material profit and physical pleasure .
the court theatre of wajid ali shah , the nawab of oudh probably followed the stage arrangements of the english theatre .
in architecture till the beginning of the nineteenth century the east india company continued to copy the portuguese style which was current in the european settlements in india .
apparently this policy succeeded in its object and an indigenous imitation of english culture was produced which gradually began to displace the hindustani culture .
no doubt the ruling family had come from a foreign land , but it had settled down in india and made india its home .
the jains do not believe in gods but their idea of an arhat is more or less the same as that of a god in hinduism .
they do not , however , regard the arhats as objects of devotion but as models of perfection .
like buddhism , jainism flourished for some time and then began to decline .
the result was that almost all its advantages were enjoyed by the british and its disadvantages suffered by the indians .
so naturally he was defeated in every round .
his indigo could not hold its own against chemical dyes and its cultivation had to be abandoned .
the government tried many schemes to help him .
but owing to the indifference of the higher and the incapacity and dishonesty of the lower officials the poor peasant did not derive much benefit from these .
the direct and indirect consequences of the agricultural depression lowered the general economic level of the country and added to the political unrest .
besides , even this limited effort was almost totally wasted on account of the insufficient period of schooling ; poor methods of teaching and bad administration .
secondary schools suffered from two disadvantages .
learning by rote without understanding bad been for centuries the bane of indian , in fact all eastern education .
in music the combination of harmony with melody and in painting the emphasis on perspective and proportion showed a distinct western influence .
most of this was , as we said , the work of those whose education had an oriental foundation .
their verbosity , confused thinking , involved writing . faulty grammar and idiom made them the laughing stock of englishmen .
in short , the intellectual as well as spiritual foundation of colonial english culture was hollow and weak .
the doctrines of karma and sansar also occupy an important place in the teaching of the upanishads .
karma is the fundamental law of the moral world .
every act , good or bad , performed by man , has an impact on his personality .
conscious acts gradually grow into unconscious habits and become part of his character .
now character in its turn determines action followed by its consequences .
this is a vicious circle in which our mind is involved .
at this level man becomes free from the compelling force of karma .
the idea of sansar is a logical consequence of karma combined with , that of the immortality of the soul .
it regards both the body and the soul as real and does not believe in a universal being or god .
this deficiency was made up later by patanjali ' s yoga .
from the theoretical point of view patanjali ' s yoga has no independent status but is the practical sequel to sankhya philosophy .
in this they were helped by the leaders of the hindu and muslim religious and cultural movements .
fortunately just at that time mahatma gandhi , who fulfilled all these conditions , appeared on the political horizon of india .
mahatma gandhi took up the challenge by setting up the satyagraha sabha , with a programme of nationwide civil resistance .
the modern educated fought among themselves over the relations between the muslims and the congress .
they , however , were more successful in dividing hindus and muslims than in luring them into communalist parties .
the muslims generally attached more importance to the opinion of the latter in matters of religion .
before answering this question it would be better to briefly survey the present cultural situation of the muslim community in india .
for them religion is , as it always was , the highest value .
he devoted the last seven years of his life to initiating the disciples who had gathered round him into the mysteries of mystical ecstasy .
swami vivekananda was only twenty - three when his master died .
here different religions and cultures have to live a harmonious life of peace and love .
to create that atmosphere and develop this harmony and love is the greatest problem for india today .
the philosopher , radhakrishnan , was the greatest representative of ' hindu nationalism ' if the word nationalism is used in an elevated sense .
but at the same time he exhorted them to give up the idea of reviving the past and reconcile themselves with the present .
while emphasising the need of maintaining a vital link with history he warned against the vain attempt to reverse the course of history .
beginning with the unfavourable factors , the most prominent obstacle to cultural unity is the variety of languages .
so until there is a link language and it is known throughout the country , an effective cultural unity is not possible .
the intuitive apprehension of unity in diversity is , as we have already said , one of the fundamental characteristics of the indian mind .
this consciousness of the manifold phenomena converging on a central point which gives them reality and life is essentially the religious experience .
so the distinctive feature of the indian character can be called religiousness .
among them the most liberal and the greatest opponent of orthodoxy was tagore .
so he had to turn to the ancient upanishads which had been guiding seekers after truth for the last 2500 years .
in any case the average hindu or muslim family has a common budget controlled by the father or the eldest earning member of the family .
often the whole family , even if very large , lives on the earnings of one person who slaves himself to death .
during the past decade , however , there has been a marked change in the situation .
the food , dress and general way of living of both communities is , barring minor differences , the same .
there are variations but these are regional not communal .
the stories of the mahabharata and the ramayana told in various folksongs had been current among the people for many generations .
strictly speaking the ramayana is not a religious poem but may be regarded as the first specimen of secular poetry .
social and political organisations , the sciences , fine arts , mode of living , food and dresseverything was cast in the mould of religion .
copies of these reports , and in one case a translation into english , have been given to me .
i make no complaint of this reporting and i do not suggest that deliberate distortions have been made .
it is not my intention to give details of the many errors and mistakes in these reports .
that would waste your time , sir , and mine , and would serve little purpose .
i am not here to defend myself , and perhaps what i say in this statement will make your task easier .
we were slow in coming to our final conclusions ; we hesitated and parleyed , we sought a way out honourable to all the parties concerned .
that was a position which we could never tolerate , whatever the consequences .
my whole nature rebelled against them and , on many an occasion , i vehemently criticised the pro - fascist and appeasement policy of the british government .
of these , the royal palaces have been destroyed by the ravages of time .
but some stupas , pillars and viharas ( monasteries ) are still extant .
. tthe carvings on their fences and gates deal not with religious but with secular subjects , and present vivid pictures of life in that period .
the asoka pillars cut out of solid stone are from 40 to 60 feet high with a polished surface shining like a mirror .
he may muse over fate , of empires which have always fallen because of this weakness , and call it destiny .
certain causes inevitably produce certain results .
we know the causes ; the results are following inexorably in their train .
it is a small matter what happens to me in this trial or subsequently .
individuals - count for little ; they come and go , as i shall go when my time is up .
there are terrifying glimpses of dark corridors which seem to lead back to primeval night , but also there is the fullness and warmth of the day about her .
these six or seven years are bound up in my inner life with kamala and you .
of course even before this period both of you played a major part in my personal and inner life .
it was in those days of the early thirties that i wrote those hundreds of letters to you which came out subsequently as glimpses .
the russian revolution , the upheavals in germany and the present terrible war in spain are simply a prelude to a devastating change in the future .
we cannot escape the elemental and natural forces working through the myriads of human beings .
you will see , before very long in the world , tremendous human cyclones ; and our political and economic problems are very important .
without solving them we cannot do anything .
but , after all , political freedom is not an end in itself .
it is a means whereby we can live a good life , and a means of solving the problem of human relationship .
we have to reach conclusions about them so that we might build the india of the future .
democratic it had been previously also but it had so far been limited in franchise and restricted to the upper classes .
industrial workers also came in but as individuals and not in their separate organized capacity .
but vishnu had a single aspect .
he was the preserver of the world , merciful towards men and provider of their welfare .
his wife lakshmi was the goddess of wealth and plenty .
the idea of the multiplicity of gods was reconciled with the vedic concept of unity with the help of the theory of symbol and incarnation .
the religious dogma took the following form .
we can conceive him in three ways : as brahma , the creator ; as vishnu the preserver ; and as shiva , the destroyer .
vishnu comes to the world again and again for the help and salvation of men .
the human form assumed by a god is called his incarnation .
thus far the alternative had been just talking and passing resolutions , or terroristic activity .
both of these were set aside and terrorism was especially condemned as opposed to the basic policy of the congress .
his ambition , he said , was ' to wipe every tear from every eye . '
on some vital matters for him , he was adamant , and on more than one occasion there came a break between him and the congress .
it may be that some of us may join the ranks of the exploiters , but that will not bring freedom to the many .
we must aim , therefore , at the destruction of all imperialism and the reconstruction of society on another basis .
that basis must be one of cooperation , and that is another name for socialism .
our national ideal must , therefore , be the establishment of a cooperative socialist commonwealth and our international ideal , a world federation of socialist states .
before we approach our ideal , we have to combat two sets of opponents political and social .
we have to overcome our alien rulers as well as the social reactionaries of india .
the infection from one affected part continually spreads to other parts and the disease takes firmer root .
your political and social philosophy must , therefore , be a complete whole and your programme must comprise every department of national activity .
religion has in the past often been used as an opiate to dull men ' s desire for freedom .
priests and other privileged classes have claimed a divine sanction for their privileges .
and with the aid of religion the masses have been told that their miseries are due to kismat or the sins of a former age .
in india today and indeed in the world there is a great deal of argument and debate on matters political and social .
from all this argument two sets of opposing ideas emerge .
one is tht reformist idea which believes in a gradual betterment with the consent of those in power or in positions of privilege today .
all those who stand today under this flag are indians , not hindus , not muslims , but indians .
we have only to find out some way whereby we may root out the fear and distrust that darken our horizon today .
i was born a hindu , but i do not know how far i am justified in calling myself one or in speaking on behalf of hindus .
we have three major problems the minorities , the indian states , and labour and peasantry .
i have dealt already with the question of minorities .
this congress which claims self - determination cannot deny it to the people of the states .
but in no event can the people of the states be ignored .
our third major problem is the biggest of all .
for india means the peasantry and labour , and to the extent that we raise them and satisfy their wants , will we succeed in our task .
and the measure of the strength of our national movement will be the measure of their adherence to it .
we can only gain them to our side by our espousing their cause , which is really the country ' s cause .
so the brahmins had complete control over the religious and social life of the people .
equally broad - based and comprehensive was the culture build on this foundation .
with all their influence over religion and social life , the brahmins had little hand in administration or government .
as purohits their main duty was to preside over the observance of religious rites .
even the four original castes were now being divided into smaller groups .
the congress has often expressed its goodwill toward them , but beyond that it has not gone .
the congress , it is said , must hold the balance fairly between capital and labour and zamindar and tenant .
the only way to right it is to do away with the domination of any one class over another .
the all india congress committee accepted . this ideal of social and economic change in a resolution it passed some months ago in bombay .
in this programme perhaps the congress as a whole cannot go very far today , but it must keep the ultimate ideal in view and work for it .
the question is not one merely of wages and charity doled out by an employer or landlord .
for trusteeship means that the power for good or evil remains with the self - appointed trustee , and he may exercise it as he will .
the sole trusteeship that can be fair is the trusteeship of the nation and not of one individual or a group .
many englishmen honestly consider themselves the trustees for india , and yet to what a condition have they reduced our country !
we have to decide for whose benefit industry must be run and the land produce food .
provincial committees should immediately get the resolution translated and widely distributed in their respective provinces .
we believe , therefore , that india must sever the british connection and attain purna swaraj or complete independence .
the arbitrary manipulation of the exchange ratio has resulted in millions being - drained away from the country .
politically , india ' s status has never been so reduced as under the british regime .
no reforms have given real political power to the people .
we recognise , however , that the most effective way of gaining our freedom is not through violence .
we , therefore , hereby solemnly resolve to carry out the congress instructions issued from time to time for the purpose of establishing purna swaraj .
why should we shout " inqilab zindabad " ?
why should we want revolution and change " ?
india of course wants a big change today .
nothing in the world that is alive remains unchanging .
fresh water runs on , and if you stop it , it becomes stangnant .
whether we want to or not , we grow old .
babies become little girls , and little girls big girls and grown - up women and old women .
we have to put up with these changes .
but there are many who refuse to admit that the world changes .
they keep their minds closed and locked up and will not permit any new ideas to come into them .
even so in our own country , we are today in the middle of a revolution .
we want to clear out all the stagnant pools and let in clean fresh water everywhere .
we must sweep away the dirt and the poverty and misery from our country .
but who dare doubt that the children of our ' generation will tolerate no slavery or cowardice ?
but we have given it such a push this time that no one can stop it .
we were unarmed but our general had given us a weapon which , though non - violent , brought our enemies to their knees .
we have to see what the nation can do and what it cannot .
this experience has convinced us all the more of the efficacy of that unique weapon .
but though we have decided to follow this method there are others who have adopted another method .
they are our brave comrades .
bhagat singh , rajguru and sukhdev were hanged on 23 march 1931 .
night had fallen and we rushed along the rohtak - delhi road , for we had to catch a train at delhi that night .
" what was all this about , " i asked them , " this bande mataram and bharat mata ki jai ? "
he volunteered to tell me all about it but i did not encourage him . /
remember that bharat mata is you and it is your ' own jai . "
why then let us shout it again all together and with right goodwill : bharat mata ki jai .
we recognise no such treaties and we shall in no event accept them .
but we need not trouble ourselves with legal research as the practice and facts are plain enough .
yet in india there are gleams of hope though dark clouds assail us .
and the brightest of these rays comes from the newly awakened people of the states .
strong language will not help us ; it is often a sign of weakness and a substitute for action .
we who had suffered as a subject people knew well what this would mean for others .
the horror that enveloped holland and belgium , the supreme tragedy of france , deeply moved us .
the imminent peril of england made us feel that we should not add to her difficulties and embarrassments .
we tried hard to find a way out , honourable and advantageous to both india and england .
we made new proposals , even going beyond our own mandate given at the last sessions of the congress at ramgarh .
we pledged ourselves for the organisation of indian defence and help in the war effort .
but we could only do so as free people , with the goodwill and cooperation of india ' s millions .
the fundamental basis for this proposal was the recognition that the imperialist structure had to go .
the viceroy and the british government have said a final " no " to us and to india .
i repeat that it is incorrect to say that there is any new parting of the ways , for our ways never lay together .
i am told that the british government has been led to believe that we shall tamely submit to their decrees because so far we have been quiescent .
our very restraint appears to have made them think that we were incapable of any action .
it is very difficult to arrive at even an approximately correct figure .
popular estimates place the number of deaths at 25,000 , but probably this is an exaggeration .
perhaps 10,000 may be nearer the mark .
he is famous for the little gems of poetry called shatakas which show great depth of conception and artistic skill .
religious and intellectual life was dominated by formalism and authoritarianism .
the two sects of puranic hinduism worshipping shiva and vishnu had developed into two separate religions .
there was religious consciousness in abundance but it had no freshness or depth .
writings on religion were confined to supplements to the puranas or duplications of the old smritis .
this was also true of drama , poetry and other branches of literature .
all the juice was pressed out of them by rigours of technique .
two remain the united states of america and the soviet unionand both are powerfully expansionist in their different ways .
that process has now been directed to the middle east and iran is at present experiencing both internal conflict and external pressure .
it would appear that the only satisfactory solution is for a united china to be built up on a fully democratic basis .
when does this happy consummation take place ?
hence the demand : quit india .
when this is the position it becomes irrelevant and absurd to talk of treaty rights or so - called independence .
indeed no responsible person can take shelter behind those treaties of over a hundred years ago .
thus it is absurd to group all these so - called states together as if their problems were similar . . . .
the way of approach to this problem is to make the people ' s welfare and progress the primary consideration .
this involves political freedom , a democratic structure , fundamental liberties and rights guaranteed and an independent judiciary .
whatever their individual virtues or failings may be , it is really the system with which we are concerned .
for that system the british government has been and is responsible .
our approach to the princes should be a friendly one , an invitation to them to join hands in the great tasks ahead .
responsible and thinking people among the services in india feel themselves standing on two stools .
what is he to do ?
the word discipline has full meaning only in the army of a free country .
the indian soldier today is different from the indian soldier of the last war .
the wall of isolation which hitherto kept him away from the people of the country has disappeared .
but you could have given no greater sign of the infancy and weakness of your movement .
our country today is under the domination of another and the sentiment of nationalism is strong .
and yet we cannot afford to ignore them for our future is intimately bound up with them .
the lot of the worker cannot be improved much by charity , nor by the goodwill of an employer or even of a government .
the battle cry of an economic programme is a far more powerful one for the peasant than that of swaraj alone .
the fear that any detailed economic programme is likely to irritate some groups is perfectly justified .
* the congress does not desire to precipitate a class conflict .
it is wise in avoiding it , but it must always be remembered that the conflict has been there and is there .
those who shape congress policy must be prepared for such a contingency and must be clear about certain matters .
the latter restriction is desirable as otherwise big estates would grow up again .
some form or other of this exists in two - thirds of india today .
the big estates can be broken up by the well recognised and usual methods employed in western countries , like england and ireland .
a principle that must be borne in mind in fixing the tax or rent is that of a living wage or income .
the congress is not against them , nor does it seek to injure them in any way .
the big zamindaris should be acquired by the state and compensation given .
what this compensation should be is to be determined later but it is clear that full compensation is impossible .
this is very wrong from the congress viewpoint .
indeed , it is playing into the hands of the government .
this is the very policy adopted by the government in gujarat .
the very idea of nationhood had completely disappeared .
south india during this time remained free both from the evils of over - civilisation and from the disastrous effects of foreign invasions .
it , therefore , did not fall a prey to political disintegration like the north .
in ad 1005 the chola ruler rajaraja made himself master of almost the whole peninsula and his navy conquered sri lanka .
his son rajendra chola further increased his dominion by annexing the region along the bay of bengal .
favourable conditions in the south saved intellectual life from the stagnation which had come over it in the north .
here the period is marked by a remarkable movement and activity in religious thought .
of these mystic poets the votaries of shiva were known as adyars and those of vishnu as alwars .
ideas are the essential basis for action .
socialism is , however , something even more than an economic doctrine ; it is a philosophy of life and as such also it appeals to me .
you know that the whole conception of modern socialism is something fairly new .
old socialism was mere humanitarianism , a mere utopian idea of justice and equality , of doing away with poverty and the rest of it .
it came more into prominence in the early days of industrial revolution .
but what is called modern or scientific socialism is marxism .
when we talk of socialism , it is essentially ' marxism we speak of .
as a socialist i must challenge anything unless i understand it .
socialism aims at the abolition of class struggle by the abolition of classes and having one class .
socialism means that there should not be such enmity , such hatred and such violence .
thus in the days when the principal means of production was the land , the landlords were the dominant class .
land is still an important means of production but there are also other means of it .
capitalism today is in a tremendous process of decay .
it is not a question of our going about cursing this individual capitalist or that for having money .
this idea of cursing capitalists or landlords individually has nothing to do with our idea of understanding what capitalism is .
the ultimate goal is far .
we cannot get it suddenly .
but still we cannot separate it from the idea of independence .
i do not think that we can win swaraj in india without the effective help of the masses of the country .
in a fight for swaraj the socialist approach to the masses is important .
one of the things that attracts me towards socialism is its freedom from dogma .
i find to my horror that some people go about and talk of socialism in terms of phrases and slogans .
i think this is the best way of running down socialism .
the basic problems of india relate to the peasantry and the industrial workers , and of the two , the agrarian problem is far the most important .
for years past labour has been fighting a constant rearguard action against wage - cuts , almost helpless to prevent them .
the strike is a powerful weapon , the only real weapon of labour .
behind the strike there must be a strong organization and public opinion .
they must remember that any form of violence , whether during a strike or at other times , is injurious to labour ' s interests .
as a step towards such industrialization , a comprehensive scheme of national planning should be formulated .
the fascination of this work grew upon me and , i think , upon the other members of our committee also .
not to have such a guiding policy was a serious drawback , yet there was no help for it .
obviously we could not consider any problem , much less plan , without some definite aim and social objective .
the objective for the country as a whole was the attainment , as far as possible , of national self - sufficiency .
international trade was certainly not excluded , but we were anxious to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of economic imperialism .
this does not necessarily mean a conflict between cottage industries and larges - scale industries .
a large number of essential industries , which are necessary for the ' independence and well - being of the country , must inevitably be on a large scale .
it lays down that the economic regeneration of the country cannot take place without industrialisation .
the way of advaita shown by shankaracharya and that of bhakti initiated by the alwar poets appear to be new movements in the religious history of india .
some historians think this foreign influence was of nestorian christianity which had prevailed in south india for a long time .
but dr tarachand in his valuable book the influence of islam on indian culture has proved that these movements were inspired by the impact of islam .
the contact of muslim arabs with south india had already begun in the latter part of the preceding period .
no wonder that their zeal rekindled in the minds of their hindu neighbours the dormant divine fire and caused a stir in their religious life .
we have to accept to a large extent the present structure , at any rate , as a jumping - off ground .
even according to the present congress policy it is our objective to nationalise key industries and key services and banking , etc .
that is something definite to go upon .
you might refer in this connection to the karachi resolution of the congress on fundamental rights , etc .
in any event , the profit motive should be subordinated to the social motive .
how far this is possible under present circumstances , it is difficult to say .
perhaps it is not possible .
if so , inevitably we have to consider the changes necessary to make it possible .
thus the very people to whom socialism should have appealed were pushed away and made hostile . . . .
the leaders of the congress disapproved strongly of these developments .
i found this atmosphere of bitterness and conflict on my return .
i was full at the time of the idea of popular fronts and joint fronts , which were being formed in some european countries .
it applied fully to india and to our struggle and that was enough for me .
i decided to devote my energies towards bridging the gulf between the old leaders and the new socialist group .
the old leaders were tried men with prestige and influence among the masses and the experience of having guided the struggle for many years .
nightly i saw the bombs fall from the air , raining death and destruction on the populace .
later i visited czechoslovakia and saw yet another tragedy , yet another betrayal , unroll itself before my eyes .
all these events impressed themselves powerfully upon me and i tried to understand our own struggle for freedom in relation to them .
bigger things were afoot and it was time that india also thought in terms of them . . . .
i am far from being an orthodox marxist , nor does any other orthodoxy appeal to me .
but i am convinced that the old liberal approach in england or elsewhere is no longer valid .
laissez faire is dead , and unless far - reaching changes are made with reasonable speed , disaster awaits us , whether we live in england or india .
today the community has to be organised in order to establish social and economic justice .
he can have freedom of conscience and mind , freedom of enterprise , and even the possession of private property on a restricted scale .
above all , he will have the freedom which comes from economic security , which only a small number possess today .
i think india and the world will have to march in this direction of socialism unless catastrophe brings ruin to the world .
it has proved effective enough already , but it is quite possible , with further experience , to extend its application in a variety of ways .
it is easy to belittle it and point to its failures , but it is far easier to point out the innumerable failures of the method of violence .
it cannot be used in a disciplined or organised manner .
i am not optimist enough to imagine that out of this chaos a free , united , and advanced india will emerge .
no one in india thinks in terms of this type of violence .
this is folly , and if continued the consequences are likely to be disastrous .
there is little stress on the mind in it or on the processes of the mind , and too much on an intuitive and authoritarian interpretation .
politically the congress is overwhelmingly left ; socially it has leftist leanings , but is predominantly centre .
so , science must think in terms of the 400 million persons in india . . . .
there was no knowledge of ultimate purposes and not even an understanding of the inmediate purpose , for science had told us nothing about any purpose in life .
there is no visible limit to the advance of science , if it is given the chance to advance .
with the help of philosophy it may go a little further and venture even on these high seas .
too many scientists to - day , who swear by science , forget all about it outside their particular spheres .
that is a large order and undoubtedly very few of us , if any at all , can function in this way with even partial success .
but this criticism applies in equal or even greater measure to all the injunctions which philosophy and religion have laid upon us .
the ultimate purposes of man may be said to be to gain knowledge , to realize truth , to apredate goodness and beauty .
very different is the method of religion .
concerned as it is principally with the regions beyond the reach of objective inquiry , it relies on emotion and intuition .
as knowledge advances , the domain of religion , in the narrow sense of the word , shrinks .
it seems to me that the old aryans were a very ' positive ' people .
they looked forward in the realms of thought , as well as towards the countries of the earth , for fresh advances and conquests .
they had the spirit of adventure in them and life was to them a wonderful game , a quest after the knowledge of this world and the next .
a passive , inactive and indolent race forgetful of the idea of freedom or honour .
our guiding principles in life are a number of restrictions .
thou shall not eat or drink with another , thou shall not touch such and such , thou shall not cross the seas and so on and so forth .
let us therefore try to learn each other ' s history and understand each other ' s past culture .
the future can only hold out its promise to us if we learn to march together .
our chief enemy today is absence of reason , and its necessary consequence bigotry .
there will then be few obstacles to unity and progress .
after 1857 the heavy hand of the british fell more on the muslims than on the hindus .
the muslims had also kept away from the new education and had few jobs under the government .
the hindus had taken far more kindly to the english language and clerkly jobs , and seemed to be more docile .
it was the age of a growing liberalism and a firm belief in a great destiny .
it is not surprising that the indians who went there were fascinated by this imposing spectacle .
more hindus went there to begin with and they returned admirers of europe and england .
gradually they got used to the shine and glamour , and the first surprise wore off .
visiting england in 1869 , he wrote letters home giving his impressions .
english education meant government jobs , security , influence , honour .
sir syed ' s decision to concentrate on western education for muslims was undoubtedly a right one .
both were thoroughly moderate and dependent on british rule .
these hindu politicians looked up to the shining lights of english liberalism gladstone , bright , etc .
probably they admired the tories and the landed classes of england . . . .
sir syed ' s dominating and forceful personality impressed itself on the indian muslims , and the aligarh college became the visible emblem of his hopes and desires .
the indian liberals are an obvious example of this .
so also sir syed ' s message was appropriate and necessary when it came , but it could not be the final ideal of a progressive community .
it is possible that had he lived a generation later , he would himself have given another orientation to that message .
or other leaders could have re - interpreted his old message and applied it to changing conditions .
this narrow outlook and hankering after government service was not confined to the muslim students of aligarh and elsewhere .
but these ten years were momentous years , and the great war had come and gone and left a broken - down world as a legacy .
and yet sir valentine had superficially every reason to come to the conclusion he did .
but behind this superficial lining up with the british government other forces were working .
inevitably the new muslim bourgeoisie was feeling more and more dissatisfied with existing conditions and was being drawn towards the nationalist movement .
it was the policy which was adopted by the muslim communalists with some apparent temporary advantages to themselves .
it believes in the eternal sanatan law of stimulus and response , namely , responsive cooperation .
the only way it has tried to meet their communalism is by its own variety of communalism .
but it has not , so far as i am aware , said a word in criticism of the white paper scheme .
this unconditional submission to the will of god is islam in its literal as well as theological sense .
this brings the life of man in harmony with the law of the universe which is the law of man ' s own nature .
about the manner in which sovereignty is delegated to the khalifa , there is a difference of opinion among interpreters of the quran .
the prophet , by applying them to the arab society of his time , formulated the first positive law of islam .
when does bhaiji think our hindu ' self started ?
on the coming of the aryans ?
why so ?
why should we abandon the earlier mohenjodaro ; and then what happens to the dravidian period ?
are the dravidians not entitled to say that the aryans are outsiders who have forcibly settled here ?
a line of demarcation is difficult to draw .
the sign of any living thing lies in its capacity to grow and change .
similarly , cultures and civilisations also are alive only so long as they have the spirit to change with the ever - changing world .
there are other vital - forces in the country , representing a new social outlook , but they are allied to the congress .
the communal groupings have no such real importance in ' spite of occasional importance being thrust upon them . . . .
the congresses a democratic organisation with its roots deep down in the indian soil .
its doors are open to every indian who believes in independence .
what does the muslim league stand for ?
does it stand for the independence of india , for anti - imperialism ?
were they going to be bullied by the threats of so - called . reformers into giving up their right to marry child - wives ?
we mixed with the crowd and marched along for some distance by the side of the procession .
but today other issues have also assumed prominence social and economic .
he writes : " i very much appreciate the orthodox hindus ' demand for protection against religious reformers in the new constitution .
this fear of communism has driven many liberals and other middle groups in europe to fascism and reaction .
even the old enemies , the jesuits and the freemasons , have covered up their bitter hostility of two hundred years to face the common enemy .
in india communism and socialism are understood by relatively very few persons and most people who shout loudest against them are supremely ignorant about them .
his position , on this issue of suppression of all reformers , is , it should be remembered , almost the same as that of the sanatanist hindus .
yet the problem remains and has to be faced .
it has to be faced for the moment because of its communal and political implications .
the only way to get over these complications is to consider the fundamental aspects and not to be led away by opportunist motives of gaining a temporary advantage .
else the temporary advantage is apt to prove a grave disadvantage and a burden later on .
india , both historically and by virtue of its importance , has been and is the classic land , of modern imperialism .
the strength of these movements can be judged from the british reaction to them .
there were ups and downs , and sometimes it appeared as if the revolutionary urge had exhausted itself and things were settling down .
and this rebellion first started , not in spain , but in morocco with the aid of non - spanish troops .
how did these military bosses dare to raise the flag of rebellion ?
it is clear enough now .
the spanish government and people were taken aback .
we see how class feelings are the final criteria in meeting a crisis .
frenchmen and englishmen hang their heads in shame .
accept hitler ' s demands , or we also will range ourselves against you .
note this : it was not only an abandonment of an ally and friend , it was also a threat of supporting the enemy .
in torment and agony of spirit the czech cabinet sits continuously for nearly forty eight hours .
the czech government surrenders .
how shall we describe this ?
the perfect description has been given by someone . it was the rape of czechoslovkia by germany with england and france holding her forcibly down .
what are they to do ?
is it the break ?
is it war ?
the strain grows and grim serious faces pour over the latest editions of the newspapers in the cafes .
further news .
they will meet again .
but behind it all the agony of suspense .
what further betrayals ?
in spite of the government ban at every factory gate , the workers demonstrate , and then march to the czechoslovakian legation to show their sympathy .
the working committee have done a great service by their constructive lead to the nation .
we do not know how far this voice of india will go in these days of war and difficulty in communication or how many outside india will hear it .
what are the professed war aims of the western allies ?
we agree .
but for the present we consider indian freedom in its world context of imperialism .
a world which has had enough of fascism cannot tolerate imperialism .
there should of course be no secret treaties , no conquests , no indemnities or reparations , no bargains over colonial areas .
for it is that application that touches the minds and hearts of the people and impresses the world .
even the shock of war has not had much effect on their mental processes or their ancient ways .
it is no easy matter to live down the prejudice of generations past and to make our people to look upon the effort as their own .
that is the way democracy functions .
a war policy for a nation must inevitably first take into consideration the defence of that country .
in addition to this it will be necessary to have a large - scale organisation for civil defence on a militia basis .
all this can only be done by a popular government .
even more important is the development of industries to supply war and other needs .
industries must develop on a vast scale in india during war time .
so the great european war is already past history after five years . and eight months an interminable period it has seemed .
what stark horror europe has passed through during these years more especially poland , russia and germany !
in this heap of ashes lie the remains of hitlerism &amp; nazism the proud challenge for world dominion .
my mind goes back to these years and picture after picture come up before it .
and then it stops at the final scene the terrible present desolation of large parts of germany .
this is the end of all the pomp &amp; glory and proud boasting .
and yet nazi germany has died hard , very hard .
it did not lack courage .
the second extract is from jawaharlal nehru ' s letter to indira gandhi , 1 may 1945 .
what a * shambles eastern and central europe have become , a vast pit of destruction and ruin and ashes .
from stalingrad and the caucasus in the east this trail of fire and death stretches right across germany to holland and belgium .
whether madness and death are the fate of man in the near future , or something better , no one can say .
but it is certain that the way of the atom bomb is not the way of peace or freedom .
what has brought you , the men and women of asia , here ?
why have you come from various countries of this mother continent of ours and gathered together in this ancient city of delhi ?
some of us , greatly daring , sent you invitations for this conference and you gave a warm welcome to that invitation .
and yet it was not merely the call from , us , but some deeper urge that brought you here .
we stand at the end of an era and on the threshold of a new period of history .
as for the generality of the common people , their relations with the ruling power became , in course of time , fairly good though not very close .
on the whole , the muslim kings maintained peace and order , ruled justly and gave religious and cultural freedom to their hindu subjects .
no doubt they had changed civil and criminal law and introduced some provisions of the islamic law .
but in india it was nothing new that rulers should enforce their own law on their subjects professing another religion .
both the hindu and the buddhist rajas had done it .
asia , after a long period of quiescence , has suddenly become important again in world affairs .
other peoples and other continents came to the fore and with their new dynamism spread out and took possession of great parts of the world .
with the coming of british rule in india these contacts were broken off and india was almost completely isolated from the rest of asia .
the land routes have revived and air travel suddenly brings us very near to one another .
in this conference and in this work there are no leaders and no , followers .
all countries of asia have to meet together on an equal basis in a common task and endeavour .
it is fitting that india should play her part in this new phase of asian development .
geography is a compelling factor , and geographically she is so situated as to be the meeting point of western and northern and eastern and south - east asia .
because of this , the history of india is a long history of her relations with the other countries of asia .
there came the great cultural stream from iran to india in remote antiquity . and then began that constant intercourse between india and the far east , notably china .
in later years south - east asia witnessed an amazing efflorescence of indian art and culture .
the mighty stream which started form arabia and developed as a mixed irano - arabic culture poured into india .
an indian , wherever he may go in asia , feels a sense of kinship with the land he visits and the people he meets .
i therefore regret greatly the attempt to boycott the jugantar .
anything that happens to them draws public attention and public support .
smaller and less known papers often have to suffer from government interference because they are not so well - known .
for this habit grows with use and gradually the public mind gets accustomed to the misuse of its powers by the government .
so we search for new ways , new aspects of the truth more in harmony with our environment .
and we question each other and debate and quarrel and evolve any number of " isms " and philosophies .
sometimes the injustice , the unhappiness , the brutality of the world oppress us and darken our minds , and we see no way out .
and yet if we take such a dismal view we have not learnt aright the lesson of life or of history .
for history teaches us of growth and progress and of the possibility of an infinite advance for man .
our science is based on taxonomy - the science of classifying and naming things .
the darwin centre seeks to reveal the museum ' s scientific work : our specimens , research and outreach activities .
we specialise in studying biological diversity .
you can get involved too - some of the different ways to take part are listed here .
there are many organisations that monitor local biodiversity .
for example , volunteers ring birds to track migration routes .
science careers
you can follow many routes in formal education , possibly leading to a career in science .
you can find out about ways to volunteer at your local library .
louvres in its double skin adjust their position to face the sun , heating up and creating a rising current in the air around them .
this warmer air is allowed to escape at the top .
it will also provide new laboratory facilities for the researchers who care for and study these collections .
for further information , see the phase two site .
early designs for the darwin centre phase two , showing the cocoon - like structure .
the darwin centre is founded on a new way of integrating collections , research and communication .
we are bringing the science and public spheres together .

darwin ' s life
this project is named after charles darwin , the renowned naturalist .
many of these collections are now held at this museum .
thirdly , communication was central to darwin ' s research .
his most famous book , the origin of species , was aimed at non - specialist readers .
darwin ' s theory of evolution is one of the cornerstones of our work .
it helps us understand how species are connected with one another .
scientists are trying to understand how the diversity of species in lake baikal , russia , evolved .
during the many years in which he refined his theory , darwin gained most of his evidence by lengthy correspondence with experts .
early in his career , darwin spent eight years studying barnacles , including the fossil species .
he produced the first definitive taxonomic studies of barnacles , in two pairs of two volumes , in 1851 and 1854 .
taxonomists are the scientists who bring order to this diversity , and name the animals and plants .
we cannot study the natural world without a coherent way of referring to this diversity , and describing the individual species and groups within it .
in studying the natural world , there have been many different taxonomies proposed for the diversity we see around us .
taxonomic systems are many and varied , depending on their end use : they are practical tools .
taxonomies arrange things according to their apparent similarities and differences .
each species has a unique ancestry , and can be grouped according to how closely it is related to other living things .
this is systematics , which aims towards a ' correct ' taxonomy based upon the evolutionary relationships of organisms .
it uses more and more powerful techniques , such as genetic analyses , to determine ' relatedness ' .
analysing large groups of specimens in this way is extremely complex , with thousands of different comparisons possible .
data - handling power
when analysing tens of species , there are so many possible ancestries that computing power is essential .
with hundreds of species , the problem is even greater .
what is their value to society , in the uk and internationally ?
how are specimens collected today ?
what are the ethical considerations ?
pressures on nature
what are the main threats and how is the museum helping to combat them ?
guides , research papers and books are all products of the scientific and academic work being carried out at the museum .
guides that allow people to identify living things are a normal product of a taxonomist ' s work .
many countries face great environmental challenges .
the internet is becoming the fastest and cheapest way to deliver the knowledge they need to conserve their natural resources .
we preserve our specimens in many different ways .
by contrast , the important characteristics of butterflies are their wing patterns .
the best way to preserve them is by drying and storing them away from sunlight .
using anatomical details of tiny arthropods to study evolution in a russian lake
efforts to stop an organism ' s natural decay process start as soon as it is collected .
our growing frozen tissue collection will enable future researchers to readily study the cells and dna of organisms collected today .
it is the first time that a collection has been created here with a view to using it in a very specific way .
past and future collecting
new collection
how are research projects leading to new collections ?
there are many ways that our collection can become damaged .
we take many steps to safeguard against this , and conserve our collections for future use .
like any other building , we are prone to insects and mice , the main threats to our collections .
quarantine in a - 30c freezer is the best way to kill insect pests on freshly collected material or specimens that show signs of infestation .
once in the collection , the only line of defence against pests is to stop them getting in .
light , temperature and humidity levels in the stores are carefully controlled to slow down this process .
in your house , the temperature changes regularly during a 24 hour cycle .
in the darwin centre spirit collection stores , the temperature is a constant 13c all day , all year round .
dust , handling and exposure to different environments take their toll on our many different collections .
specimens need to be checked regularly for damage by pests or the environment , or for evaporation of alcohol .
how do we collect specimens and information to enhance our collections and further our research ?
how does science progress ?
what methods do our researchers use in their studies ?
research is a highly creative process , in which new ideas are always needed .
working in teams , and discussing research with others , help provide these ideas .
many of the most creative periods in science are characterised by scientists of diverse areas of expertise working together .
for example , crick , franklin , watson and wilkins working out the structure of dna in the 1950s .
the wide - ranging expertise of researchers at the museum allows many questions to be explored .
email and the internet ensure that this debate involves research groups across the world .
when a research project has ended , its results must be communicated so others can build upon its conclusions .
through initiatives such as the darwin centre , and events such as national science week researchers interact directly with the public .
participate in a live encounter with museum scientists .
resources - the specimens
the museum has three core resources for carrying out its work : the specimens , the libraries and the expert researchers .
the specimens are used in a range of different ways . . .
our libraries are crucial to our research and curation .
as well as holding current journals containing relevant modern work , they contain a vast historical archive .
touch one . . .
taxonomy requires a great deal of expertise .
a specimen is useless without information .
we have a range of ways of collecting all sorts of data . . .
modern geographical positioning systems ( gps ) can pinpoint a specimen ' s collection locality within a few metres .
photography on - site records details of a specimen ' s habitat and surroundings .
a notebook and a pencil are the most valuable tools .
collectors record the behaviour of the species in the wild to help understand the specimen back in the laboratory .
analysis - molecular
increasingly researchers are looking at the dna of organisms to distinguish one species from another .
scientists analyse genes by taking a sample of dna from an organism and sequencing it .
we can compare these sequences to look at the similarities and differences between species .
how many different options will there be to test ?
there are many ways of looking at habitats and specimens , at many different scales .
science method
science is a powerful technique for understanding the world around us .
across all the sciences , there are a few basic principles , which researchers adhere to .
a scientist will first formulate a hypothesis - an idea about how or why something is the way it is .
then , the scientist will devise a series of experiments to test whether the hypothesis is true or false .
if it appears true by that experiment , it must be tested against others .
lake baikal , russia
discoveries of new arthropod species in a remote siberian lake are helping scientists understand how new species come into being .
soil - eating african termites make up over 10 per cent of the rainforest animal biomass .
scientists here are discovering how they affect the soil .
midges and climate change
scientists are tracking climate change through studying tiny corpses of midges found in the bottoms of lakes .
barely studied , the deep sea is an alien habitat .
by classifying the animals that live there , we aim to understand the environmental impacts upon it .
during its 25 - million - year history , three deep basins have formed in the lake .
it is also the only freshwater lake known to have underwater ' reefs ' of giant sponges .
but it is difficult to predict exactly how the climate will change in the future .
scientists need to test their climate change models by testing them against how climate has changed in the past .
so , to test these models we need a way of understanding past climate change .
steve brooks , entomologist
the mahabharata was translated under the patronage of nusrat shah .
in the deccan states , relations between the muslim rulers and their hindu subjects were even more intimate and cordial .
the founder of the bahmani kingdom had got his throne through the efforts of his brahmin friend pangu .
out of gratitude and love the king not only made him his vizier but adopted the name gangu as the nickname of the royal dynasty .
during the bahmani period brahmins and other hindus generally had a large share in the administration of the state .
the five muslim kingdoms which were built on the ruins of the bahmani sultanate continued this liberal policy .
their kings were patrons of the local languages and some of them were good marathi and urdu poets .
but the greatest success in the effort to create harmony between hindus and muslims was attained during this period by sultan zainul - abidin , the king of kashmir .
that was why he laid much more emphasis on direct contact with the people than any muslim king had ever thought of doing .
other important traditions of the old indian state were revived by the mughal state under akbar .
akbar imposed restrictions on drinking , gambling and prostitution equally on all sections of the people .
at the risk of being accused of interference with religion he even put down some specifically hindu customs like sati ( the burning alive of widows ) .
this resulted in the creation of a common culture centred on the court but spread far and wide throughout the mughal dominions .
in northern india persian had been the court language as well as the language of literary expression and conversation among the muslims .
this system of common education for all citizens of the state helped not only in creating the community of language but also that of ideas .
apart from religious schools which were denominational , all secular schools had the same syllabus for all people without distinction of caste or creed .
this educational policy promoted cultural understanding on a higher level .
hindu and muslim scholars were encouraged to translate standard works from sanskrit into persian and to write books on past and contemporary history .
to take translation first . the atharva veda and ramayana were rendered into persian by mulla abdul qadir badaoni in cooperation with a hindu pundit .
later , several translations of the ramayana were made in persian prose and poetry by hindus .
the mahabharata was translated by a board of hindu and muslim scholars of which mullah abdul qadir was a member .
the great poet faizi rendered lilavati , the classical work on mathematics into persian .
in jehangir ' s time the hindu influence seems to have increased .
on the contrary universal love is essential for attaining peace of mind .
this law of love he enunciates in the following words :
" hatred does not cease by meeting hatred with hatred but by meeting it with love .
this is its nature .
if one wants to live a happy life one should not hate one ' s enemies .
conquer resentment with love , evil with good , greed with generosity , and falsehood with truth ! . "
still , during the first hundred years the number of his followers was very small and was confined to koshala and magadha .
the persian masters syed ali and abdus samad initiated their young pupils , mostly hindus , into the intricacies of persian drawing and colouring .
for theoretical education a library was provided which had a collection of books on art and the masterpieces of old artists .
akbar himself visited the academy very frequently to see the artists at work .
of the products of this school the most famous are daswant , farrukh beg , basavan and sanvala .
they followed the old indian custom of illustrating secular and not religious books .
farrukh beg , nadir , mohammad murad , abul hasan , mansur , bishen das , manohar and daulat were the foremost artists of this period .
many orthodox indians hesitated to send their children to government colleges as they were afraid of undesirable influences on their religious ideas .
these two institutions were packed to capacity while very few students attended the oriental colleges .
in 1829 , when english was declared the official language , the oriental colleges received a further setback .
industrial and vocational education was completely neglected , probably under the general policy of suppressing native handicrafts and industries .
but we must make two things clear to avoid any misunderstanding .
the pivot of social and cultural life used to be the royal court .
those who were not absorbed in government service went in for law and in a few cases for other independent professions .
such were the pioneers of the modern age and the colonial english culture , destined to illumine other minds with the new light from the west .
in all fairness it must be said that they made an earnest effort to imitate what they thought to be the english way of life .
similarly , they mistook the healthy individualism of the english for egoism , their rational utilitarianism for love of money .
the negotiations for peace carried on in the midst of violent clashes in several parts of india naturally failed .
the two parts were to be declared free british dominions on august 14 and 15 , 1947 , respectively .
so the great dream of freedom which india had been dreaming for a long time was at last realised .
she escaped from her bondage with her life but not limbs intact as she had to lose two of her organic parts .
a constitution was completed and passed by the constituent assembly at the end of 1949 and came into force on january 26 , 1950 .
india became a sovereign democratic republic but has maintained an informal connection with the british through the commonwealth since then .
the growing influence of colonial english culture in the second quarter of the nineteenth century alarmed leading hindus and muslims .
arjuna ' s trouble is that his moral duty urges him to act but the consequences of this action seem to be entirely immoral .
sri krishna resolves this difficulty on the basis of the philosophy of the upanishads and so he has to explain the fundamental principles of this philosophy .
the gist of his argument is that to find the right way to moral action it is essential to base morality on religion .
every individual act has to be judged by the standards which religion has laid down .
the religious ideal according to the upanishads is the realisation of the unity of being .
at this stage the whole nature of one ' s action changes .
but when he rises above the intellectual level to that of religious intuition , he is conscious of the perfect identity of god , man and the universe .
in a democratic society the function of directing and controlling art and culture can only be entrusted to public opinion .
however , some measure of state control on cultural life is necessary .
the state must have the power of making laws for preserving the cultural wealth of the country from damage or destruction .
this cultural synthesis should start with a national language , for language is the soul of culture .
unity in diversity has always been the distinguishing feature of indian culture .
we should keep it as our aim in our efforts to build the new national culture .
but even the semblance of liberal democracy before independence , made necessary some change in the traditional social system .
there are in our country strong opponents of industrial progress .
they are the people who think that material comfort is an obstacle to spiritual salvation and advocate an ascetic or at least an austere way of life .
as the whole purpose of industrial progress is to produce the maximum means for material comfort , their opposition to industrialisation is understandable .
the history of all industrial countries shows that industrialisation made a change in the social structure inevitable and all efforts to avoid it were in vain .
as far as the equality of opportunity to pursue higher education is concerned , the position is still more unsatisfactory .
obviously children from poor families can only go beyond the primary stage with the help of stipends from the government .
taking advantage of this land hunger the landlords , unable under the law to enhance their rents beyond a certain percentage , charged huge illegal premiums .
what books do i read ?
among the english and american periodicals i have subscribed to regularly for many years are :
in this letter ; jawaharlal nehru refers to his seven terms in prison .
i should like to get the labour monthly of london as well as some other leftist periodicals but they are not allowed entry in india .
i suppose my father and gandhiji have been the chief personal influences in my life .
there was an element of magic about it , an uncritical credulousness , a reliance on the supernatural .
science does not tell us much , or for the matter of that anything about the purpose of life .
the old controversy between science and religion takes a new formthe application of the scientific method to emotional and religious experiences .
religion merges into mysticism and metaphysics and philosophy .
architecture too had made little progress .
the cities were generally planned in the form of a square or a rectangle .
the main street ran from east to west , side streets from north to south .
a separate quarter was set apart for each of the various vocational groups .
temples were situated in the northern part of the city and in each of them there was a chamber of bamboo lattice - work which served as an altar .
even in cities where bricks were used for building houses , temples were generally made of bamboo .
the oldest temple which has so far been traced is the vishnu temple near chittor .
another belonging to the same period has been found in bes nagar .
something of this kind we see happening now , and behind this war there lies this internal conflict of the spirit of man .
in the midst of disaster , he has not lost his dignity or his faith in the values he cherished .
whatever gods there be , there is something godlike in man , as there is also something of the devil in him .
the vaishya caste specially had split on the occupational basis into many sub - castes such as vaidya , kayastha , etc .
women had a high status in society but they were not allowed to step outside their prescribed range of duties .
a brief survey of different cultures shows the general conditions created by the puranic hindu religion .
though in the puranic age religion continued to dominate society , the process of differentiation of the various departments of life became more pronounced .
the progress of science and literature was accelerated by the increasing use of books .
in north india the barks of some trees and in south india palm leaves of various kinds were used for writing .
i would demand that this government must go .
was this freedom and democracy meant for us also , or only for the favoured mortals who lived in europe and its extensions ?
did it mean that imperialism would go from here and elsewhere ?
we inquired from the british government and asked to be enlightened , so that we might know what course we should pursue .
our inquiries were considered irrelevant and impertinent .
the national congress had not asked anything for itself .
in the mind and heart of india there was a conflict .
in western europe this conflict had raged hundreds of years ago and resulted in establishing the authority of parliament .
our course was clear .
but the spirit of revolt led these youths to provoke the pickets and thus walk into the enemy ' s trap .
the i . n . a . episode and the recent royal indian air force and royal indian navy strikes have rendered the country a very great service .
the gulf that separated the people from the armed forces has once for all been bridged .
the people and the soldier have come very close to each other .
they have now come to realise that they both have one common aimthe freeing of their country from foreign yoke .
neither the sardar nor the maulana is in a position to give any guarantee in the present state of our slavery .
it is the government alone which can do so .
but i deprecate the mass violence in bombay during the past four days .
in england and america such situations are dealt with differently .
the valuable work of the indian national cqngress will certainly be wasted if people give expression to the urge for freedom in terms of violence .
we should be careful about the unsociakelements which are only too ready to exploit any situation to their advantage .
you have no right to pull down a foreign flag from a ' private premises .
but i realise that the , majority in the congress , as it is constituted today , may not be prepared to go thus far .
the congress has been in the past a broad front representing various opinions joined together by that common bond .
it must continue as such even though the difference of those opinions becomes more marked .
we must not simply think that capitalism has always been bad .
the problem of production of wealth was solved by capitalism but not the problem of distribution of wealth .
this is connected with the modern growth of imperialism , with the demands of raw materials and a demand for markets .
when we talk of anti - imperialism , most of us think it is against england .
we must understand that imperialism is something vaster and entirely different from england , france or any other country .
there is english imperialism , french imperialism , japanese imperialism .
at first they tried to divide the world .
congress parties in the legislatures should also keep in touch with congress committees and with public opinion generally .
by this frank approach they will get the friendly cooperation of the public and will be in touch with realities of the situation .
the masses will thus also be trained and disciplined in the democratic method .
only by their own strength can they ultimately progress or resist the inroads that vested interests might make on them .
a boon given from above to a weak peasantry may be taken away later , and even a good law may have little value because it connot be enforced .
some important principles have , however , been laid down in the karachi resolution and in the election manifesto .
the karachi congress resolution on fundamental rights further laid down that :
agriculture is and will remain the largest single industry of this country , and it is associated with a host of subsidiary industries .
any improvement or variation in agriculture has far - reaching results in the economy of the nation .
agriculture must , therefore , inevitably be considered by this committee in its scheme of national planning .
but planning , as most of us conceive it , is inevitably connected with a socialist society .
but india has not accepted this goal , and our immediate objective is political independence .
we must remember this and not confuse the issue , for else we will have neither socialism nor independence .
marxism and socialism are not policies of violence , though , like most other groups , capitalist or liberal , they envisage the possibility of violence .
can they fit in with the peaceful methods of the congress , not only as a temporary expedient , but in a straight forward bona fide manner ?
for us the problem is that of india and of india of today and tomorrow .
but here in india large numbers of people have recognised it , and it has become the solid foundation of our movement .
not to do so is to fall between two stools .
we discuss our differences and sometimes over - emphasize them .
so far as the congress is concerned there is no such difficulty .
the real difficulty is not so much in what we do or even in the resolutions we pass , but in our approach and interpretation .
it must remain so if it is to fulfil its historic purpose .
there has been a tendency in the congress leadership in the past to become sectarian , narrow - minded , and exclusive .
that is undesirable and creates barriers between it and large numbers of people in the congress and the country .
today they are not in a position to do so .
they have neither the national backing nor the discipline for the job .
the left today can destroy ; it cannot build .
the world progresses and advances in knowledge and culture even though there are occasional lapses and retrogression .
this resolution was most objectionable and i referred to it in my benares speech .
as a matter of fact no such resolution had been passed by any organisation , and we had been the victims of a hoax .
my benares speech , briefly reported , created an uproar .
used as i was to such outcries , i was quite taken aback by the vehemence of the attack of the hindu mahasabha leaders .
this article of mine was given great publicity in the indian press .
the hindu mahasabha leaders , who had denounced me in the most vigorous and varied language , now remained perfectly silent .
i did not imagine , of course , that i could conjure away the passions that underlay the communal spirit .
it was my intention to carry on with this reasoned attack when prison claimed me again .
some people , however , seem to imagine that by a frequent repetition of the magic formula , unity will ultimately emerge .
it is interesting to trace british policy since the rising of 1857 in its relation to the communal question .
fundamentally and inevitably it has been one of preventing the hindu and muslim from acting together , and of playing off one community against another .
the whole of the case of the sind hindu sabha is a negation of the principle of democracy , except in so far as joint electorates are demanded .
it is an attempt to prevent the will of the majority from prevailing because the minority might suffer .
collective welfare is the key to the attitude taken by the quran towards political , social as well as other aspects of cultural life .
in the economic field private property is recognised , but special care is taken to prevent the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few .
of the three forms of exploitation , which existed at the time , slavery , usury and cornering , the last two were practically abolished .
we have thus to see how far they so fit in .
our great provincial languages are no dialects or vernaculars , as the ignorant sometimes call them .
our system of education and public work must therefore be based on the provincial languages .
what are these languages ?
it is obvious that such a condition of affairs is intolerable for us in india .
they have troubles of their own ; why add to them ?
the problem of india is thus of the present , of today .
to admire or condemn her past does not help us much , except in so far as an understanding of the past helps us to understand the present .
it is , therefore , from this wider point of view that we must consider it , as a part of the more immediate problems that confront us .
it is also clear that the new act has displeased and irritated all active elements in the country , and they can never submit to it willingly .
there is more resentment and hostility against imperialist domination in india than at any previous time .
there can be little doubt that the not distant future will see great changes in india , and the approach to freedom .
even real political freedom will be out of our reach , much more so radical social changes . . . .
you may have grown impatient .
but i am convinced that the only right way of looking at our own problems is to see them in their proper place in a world setting .
i am convinced that there is intimate connection between world events , and our national problem is but a part of the world problem of capitalist imperialism .
to look at each event apart from the others and without understanding the connection between them must lead to the formation of erratic and erroneous views .
nazi germany and fascist italy were entirely on the side of the rebels and gave them every help .
british financiers rejoiced at the victories of the rebels .
in spain today we see clearly the terrible conflict of the forces of progress and the forces of reaction , the conflict which is latent all over the world .
the triumph of the rebels means the strangling of france by three fascist countries surrounding her .
it means that fascism will make a triumphant attempt at world dominion in cooperation with the fascism of japan .
we have seen during the past year or more how britain has indirectly sought to help the rebels in spain .
why is this so ?
it is clear that if there is war in europe , it will come through the aggression of nazi germany .
jawaharlal nehru went to europe in 1938 .
he was in barcelona , in spain , for five days and ' watched the bombs fall nightly from the air ' .
the caste system had become so rigid that the lower classes of hindu society were completely cut off from the higher classes and higher culture .
he delivered to the world his message of compassion , love , self - restraint and self - culture .
the essence of buddha ' s teaching is the sermon he gave in banaras after his enlightenment :
" listen ye bhikshus !
that is the low , yain and worthless life of ignorance fit for none but the blind worshipper of the world .
there is ye bhikshus a middle path between the two which the tathagatha ( buddha ) has found .
the pursuit of this path opens the eyes and enlightens the mind .
normally war offices do not shout about their latest weapons and indeed try their utmost to keep them secret .
it is true that probably such an experiment could not have been kept wholly secret .
but still there was no obvious necessity for deliberate publicity unless some definite objective was being aimed at .
what could this be ?
it was a challenge and a threat .
it was a reminder of the stark reality behind all the talks of the foreign ministers and the u . n . o .
this is not the way to lay the foundations of peace or to remove the fear in people ' s minds which leads so often to war .
indeed , this occasion is unique in history , for never before has such a gathering met together at any place .
and because we are participating in this making of history , something of the greatness of historic events comes to us all . . . .
we seek no narrow nationalism .
we of asia have a special responsibility to the people of africa .
this is not a matter of political views or opinions .
the freedom of the press does not consist in our permitting such things as we like to appear .
even a tyrant is agreeable to this type of freedom .
for it is always a dangerous thing to seek a temporary advantage at the cost of the larger good or of the final objective .

why do we need them ?
nature ' s catalogue
from ants to zebras - what range of species are represented in our collections ?
what types of things are our specimens ?
where in the world ?
from where did our specimens originate ?
what kinds of places are they from ?
what is a specimen ?
sometimes , these might have been modified by human activity : for instance many shells have been carved with intricate patterns .
the label tells us when and where this specimen was collected and who collected it .
without this information , the specimen would be a historical artefact , but scientifically it would be useless .
the name of the specimen is added once it has been identified .
a coloured tag shows that the specimen is the first of its species to be described and named .
this is called the ' type ' specimen .
we have over 60 million life science specimens , including over 850,000 types .
why do we need specimens ?
our life science specimens make up an encyclopaedia of the natural world .
they are a rich and unique resource for taxonomists and scientists all over the world .
scientists have found an incredible abundance of new species in lake baikal , russia .
researchers study the appearance , body tissues and dna of specimens in the collections .
they are the basis of our many research projects .
termite studies
researchers use the historic termite collection to study termites and soil in tropical rainforests .
specimens : natural materials
our specimens take many different forms , from tiny pollen grains to skeletons of 70 - tonne whales .
by keeping different kinds and parts of organisms , we maximise our possibilities for research .
our art collection is the third largest in the uk .
sometimes , an illustration is the only record we have of a specimen that has been lost or destroyed .
specimens in our collections date from the fifteenth century to the present day .
virtually all groups of plants and animals , and the natural variations that exist within them , are represented in the life science collections .
our insect collection holds half of the one million insect species known today .
with some of our earliest specimens dating from the late 1400s , the collections here provide insight into the natural world 400 years ago .
many of our specimens are from places that would be unrecognisable to their collectors today .
nature ' s catalogue - how large is it ?
we aim to database all of our collections .
this will enable people to easily access information about them .
it will also tell us exactly how many species we hold .
how do researchers keep track of the huge number of specimens held in the museum ?
where in the world
our active research generates specimens from all over the globe but some regions are better represented in our collections than others .
some of the reasons for this are political .
history
some parts of the world have always been easier to access than others .
one legacy from our political past is that 10 per cent of our collections are from the british isles and former british empire .
modern politics also play a part in determining which places we collect from .
for example , ongoing civil war in sri lanka means that we have been unable to collect from the northern part of the island .
where in the world
our research priorities partly dictate where many of our specimens come from today .
these priorities are determined by the need to research regions under threat , collaborations with other institutions or governments and , ultimately , funding .
our collecting is also influenced by the collections we already have .
why do we need to do more research on the plants of central america ?
one region can be home to several different types of habitat .
we are trying to study as many of them as we can .
how do we collect in these diverse habitats ?
we collect specimens and data in a range of habitats . . .
ordering the world
scientists have classified the living world into six major kingdoms .
these are then sub - divided into progressively smaller sets .
' species ' is the most specific unit of classification .
every known living thing has a general genus name and a more specific species name .
often , the species name is descriptive of the organism ' s characteristics , its geographical location or the person who discovered it .
why classify the natural world ?
why is it necessary to classify living things ?
why is the system so strict ?
ordering : type specimens
a type specimen is the first specimen of its species to be described , and given a species name , in a publication .
we hold more than 850,000 of them , more than any other museum in the world .
types are the foundation of our naming system , the ' dictionary ' of the natural world .
these unique specimens are the key references by which we describe and name the rest of the natural world .
finding things
identifying specimens is a large part of museum research .
how do curators use type specimens to do this ?
in the case of the okapi , a small close relative of the giraffe that originated in the congo , the first specimen obtained was this belt .
this subsequently became the type specimen .
to determine whether you have found an example of a new species , you need many others to compare it to .
some researchers suggest that because they look so different , they should be separated into different species groups .
for example , scientists might split a group of organisms , described previously as one species , into three different species .
this kind of renaming occurs as a product of new knowledge rather than a desire to regroup the natural world .
with 60 million life science specimens , how do we keep track of them all ?
how do we incorporate new additions ?
we aim to keep our specimens in good condition for hundreds of years .
how do we prepare fresh material for the long store ?
how do we make the specimens available to researchers ?
access to information
the national collections here are a library of the natural world .
every item in the museum ' s collection is recorded , catalogued and given a number that will become its unique identity tag .
this bone came to the museum on 2 november 1949 .
the last number shows it was the first specimen recorded that day .
how do museum researchers find out what a new specimen is ?
160,000 specimens are added to our life science collections every year on average .
donations are the main source of new study material for many of our collections .
in other areas , new specimens are also generated through our active research around the world .
how do we obtain new specimens from their habitats ?
what are the ethical considerations when collecting a new specimen from the wild ?
touch the images to find out how these specimens got here .
the museum is an international resource .
visiting scientists , artists , writers and researchers spend anything from one week to many years here , studying the collections and using the research facilities .
alex monro , botany researcher .
at any one time , around 80,000 specimens can be on loan to experts around the globe , from our beetle collection alone .
for each group of species , there is a handful of experts .
in order to identify some of our specimens , we post them to other experts across the world .
similarly , outside institutions donate specimens to us in return for their identification .
the new knowledge we gain from these collaborations increases the intellectual value of our collections .
some of a scientist ' s time is spent telling others what they have learned .
our role is to ensure that our knowledge about the natural world is available to the people who need it .
we receive enquiries every day from the public , commercial companies , official bodies , other museums and scientific institutions .
a pioneering collection of mosquito dna is helping scientists to track down the spread of malaria .
flora mesoamericana
the rich flora of central america is under threat .
the museum , with local partners , is helping to understand and protect this precious biodiversity .
a unique lake
lake baikal is the largest , deepest and oldest lake in the world , holding about 20 per cent of all surface fresh water on earth .
because of its size and varying depths , it has a huge variety of ecosystems within it .
lake baikal holds over 2,000 species of animals .
these provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study the processes that lead to the emergence of new species .
lake baikal contains a range of small crustaceans called diacyclops .
occasionally indians also built their houses in this style but the blending of the european and indian styles had not yet taken place .
but the real and significant influence on indian life was exercised by the technical aspect of western civilisation .
towards , the end of this period gaslight , the railways and telegraph were introduced into the country .
the first railway line was opened between bombay and thana in 1853 and between calcutta and raniganj in 1855 .
on january 26 1930 , the historic pledge of independence was taken by millions of people in public meetings held all over india .
about 100,000 people of all castes and creeds courted imprisonment , many suffering physical violence at the hands of the police without attempting retaliation .
many died in police firings .
we will make a brief survey of these movements of reform and revival which will help us in understanding the present cultural situation in india .
we have seen that when the muslims came to india their general , cultural and religious life had already considerably deviated from the lines laid down by islam .
he exhorted the common people and the nobles of the royal court to live a pure austere life in keeping with the islamic shariah .
but the greatest contribution to the movement of religious reform among sunni muslims was made by shah waliullah and his family .
maulana syed ahmad and maulvi mohammad fell on the battlefield and the ' islamic state ' came to an end .
but the purely social and religious reform movement started by shah waliullah and his sons had more success .
this puritanical movement was further intensified due to the menace to orthodox religion which the growing influence of western culture after 1857 brought with it .
another distinguished pioneer of the freedom movement was maulana shibli .
a few years after the birth of deobund , another great muslim reformer sir syed ahmad khan founded aligarh college for modern western education .
both institutions aimed at reforming the muslim community but their concept of reform differed .
syed ahmad khan himself was a high - minded enlightened reformer and statesman whose aim was wide and high .
in politics , his policy was of conditional cooperation with the government which would be consistent with the national self - respect of indians .
but unfortunately the union between the , two sections of muslims did not last long .
this one - sided trend was probably a reaction against the religious philosophy of the time which had totally rejected all ritual and prayer .
but the highest achievement of the hindu mind in this age shows itself in another philosophy expounded in the bhagwad gita .
the gita is not a separate book but a part of the epic mahabharata .
arjuna asks himself if it is not a sin to bring destruction on god ' s creatures and to slay his own kith and kin .
sri krishna , the incarnation of vishnu , disguised as arjuna ' s charioteer observes his spiritual predicament and comes to his rescue .
for seven years he issued a journal , the arya , in which his autobiography , the life divine , appeared serially .
it was later published as a book in three volumes .
sri aurobindo has exercised a deep influence on educated hindus .
his philosophical speculations are too difficult for most laymen , but all . revere and love his almost legendary personality .
in this brief review of the new religious and intellectual movements in hindu society we see two opposite tendencies at work :
he did weld many muslims and most hindus into one nation .
similarly , linguistic minorities in the areas of regional languages are dissatisfied with the attitude in the respective majorities .
another powerful factor working for ultimate cultural unity in india is the community of political ideas which has developed within the last sixty or seventy years .
i know the forces that act and drive and lead to power but it is not that .
i see you where you are what i am . "
religion is not a departmental affair ; it is neither mere thought nor mere feeling nor mere action .
the real divergence between the religious philosophy of tagore and iqbal is seen in their conceptions of the human personality and the relation between man and god .
tagore regards the personality of the individual as real from the relative , human point of view but unreal from that of absolute truth .
by drawing closer to the infinite the finite human being does not lose his individuality .
on the contrary his individuality becomes more complete , more pronounced .
nature is to the divine self as character is to the human self . "
the finite human mind , however , regards the physical world as opposed to it and tries to overcome it .
its knowledge of the world is not passive but dynamic .
it is a kind of " insight ' which is beyond the range of perception .
in tagore and iqbal ' s ideas about god , man and the world , are reflected their philosophies of life .
now that free india has decided to build a socialist pattern for its industrial society a fundamental change is imperative .
after the first world war , mahatma gandhi started a ' constructive programme ' of which social reform , specially the abolition of untouchability , was an essential creed .
as we said before , the spirit which animated the movements of social reform before independence was one of respect for human liberty and dignity .
the raja had come to be regarded as the religious head of the buddhists .
the hindus " enjoyed complete freedom of faith and worship .
the change which buddhism brought about in the social system was that , though caste distinctions did not disappear , they became less important .
the buddhist sangha opened its doors to all castes and thus the religious basis of varnashram was weakened .
in general social life the hierarchy of the caste system persisted even among the buddhists and the jains , but the order of gradation was changed to some extent .
the nobles who belonged to the kshatriya and the traders who belonged to the vaishya castes were now regarded . superior to the brahmins .
as far as the problem of integrated education is concerned , very little thought was given to it immediately after independence .
it did not help them to grow into integrated people or enable them to rise to their full stature .
he laid , therefore , the greatest stress on the harmonious development of ' hand , head and heart ' at the primary stage of education .
the following will give some idea of what he meant by education :
in other words , an intelligent use of the bodily organs in a child provides the best and quickest way of developing his intellect .
by spiritual training i mean the education of the heart .
as i grew up and became engaged in activities which promised to lead to india ' s freedom , i became obsessed with the thought of india .
what is this india , apart from her physical i ^ jjm geographical aspects ?
does she represent anything vital now , apart from being the home of a vast number of human beings ?
how does she fit into the modern world ?
what was the tremendous faith , i wondered , that had drawn our people for untold generations to this famous river of india ? "
these journeys and visits of mine , with the background of my reading , gave me an insight into the past .
politics and elections were day to day affairs when we grew excited over trumpery matters .
this book was written in jail during june 1934 to february 1935 .
the ends cannot be separated from the means .
i have had seven terms in prison .
total period of sentences : ten and a half years longest sentence : 2 ' / 2 years plus fine .
total period actually spent in prison : 5 / years .
this added to jail remissions for good conduct amounts to nearly 7 years .
longest period at a time : a little under two years .
yes , i like lettuce salad and good conversation and animals and flowers , and swimming and riding .
perhaps one likes most the things one is deprived of .
my wife sent me a thermos flask filled with iced sherbet and i did enjoy that .
i feel angry when i see cruelty to human beings or animals .
i suppose i am rather soft that way .
i suppose that would be a fair definition of some politicians at least .
about six months ago i wrote an article about myself .
official honours and awards are given by the british government in india .
jawaharlal nehru what was my philosophy of life ?
some years earlier i would not have been so hesitant .
often , as i look at this world , i have a sense of mysteries , of unknown depths .
if the subjective element is unavoidable and inevitable , it should be conditioned as far as possible by the scientific method .
at the same time the vedanta , as well as other similar approaches , rather frighten me with their vague , formless incursions into infinity .
yet there was something more to it than that , certain basic urges which had greater permanence .
i did not like the frequent - divorce in communist , as in other , practice between action and these basic urges or principles .
it is true that even rational and scientific thought does not always take us as far as we would like to go .
i do not yet know the exact nature of the charge against me .
by those resolutions and statements i stand , and i consider it my duty to take the message of the congress to the people of india .
it had been decided that i should do so , after giving due notice to the authorities , from november 7 onwards , in the . district of allahabad .
if i was chosen , or before me shri vinoba bhave was chosen for this purpose , it was not to give expression to our individual views .
we were symbols of the people of india .
but when it came nearer home and threatened the british empire itself , the clash came and war began .
they chose the former , though they talked still in terms of freedom and self - determination - and democracy .
but their conception of freedom was , even in words , limited to europe , and evideritly meant freedom to carry on with their empire in the old way .
not even peril and disaster have weakened their intention to hold on to their empire and to enforce their will upon subject peoples .
in india we have had over a year of war government .
with that we have nothing in common and we shall resist it to the uttermost .
we have therefore decided to be no parties to this imposed war and to declare this to the world .
this war has led already to widespread destruction and will lead to even greater - - horror and misery .
with those who suffer we sympathise deeply and in all sincerity .
that is our bounden duty .
i stand before you , sir , as an individual being tried for certain offences against the state .
this period marks the beginning of indian history in the proper sense of the word .
on this scanty data it is difficult to base anything like a full account of the period , specially to place the facts chronologically .
the exploitation of the material from all these sources can help , and to some extent has helped , in compiling a more or less authentic historical account .
by the time alexander the great invaded india ( 326 bc ) , it had gradually conquered the neighbouring states and grown into a big empire .
asoka was a buddhist and a zealous propagator of buddhism .
that is the issue before me and that , ultimately , is the issue before you , sir .
i am glad that it was my visit to gorakhpur district and my attempt to serve its people , that has led to this trial .
i thank you , sir , for your courtesy .
would it be desirable to adjourn the hearing and take up the case after some time in the course of the day ?
why this concession ?
jn : the government advocate has taken a lot of trouble for nothing in proving what is already proved .
what i wanted to prove has been said in my statement .
he even came to allahabad once and drew up a scheme for its - town - planning !
petty manual tasks in the garden or some craft .
i could not live up to them and indeed i had no intentions of doing so .
and so again i retired into my shell and peeped out of it .
well , i really do not know myself .
but i could not begin and it grows harder to do so , as time goes by .
why so ?
but belief in these gods was only a minor point in the vedic hindu creed and was not fully assimilated in it .
the new form of hinduism realised the full importance of this old belief and after reconciling it with unitarianism , made it an essential part of its religious faith .
they visualised them in human form , and made their images and worshipped them .
their powerful and unrestrained imagination had conceived the origin and growth of the universe and the relations between the various natural phenomena in the form of myths about gods .
in other parts vishnu , the god of livelihood , and his wife lakshmi were the special objects of veneration .
as sexual reproduction is the root of life as well as of death , shiva was believed to have a dual personality .
on one side he was regarded as the ruler of the universe , and on the other , as its destroyer .
the days pass easily enough with reading , spinning and various other activities .
only strength counts in this naked age which lays bare all weaknesses .
a people or a nation which still thinks in terms of law and lawyers is lost .
in a sense , that might be considered a split within the congress , for some estimable people left the congress .
the same process took place when mahatma gandhi came into the movement .
again , the congress lost some people who - had worked along with it for many years .
the whole congress changed .
always you have this choice before you .
how are you going to face these problems and how are you going to face the bigger problems that the world is going to thrust before you ?
i should like you to consider these in relation to the big world issues .
you cannot possibly separate these problems .
in whatever profession you are , you must face them .
even when the harvest is good , the peasents are not better off .
we have come to a stage when , however good the harvest might be , it does no good to the peasant .
what is truth ?
i do not know for certain , and perhaps our truths are relative and absolute truth is beyond us .
according to this definition i do not know of any person who holds to the truth as gandhi does .
you have met here , i take it , because you are not ' content with things as they are and seek to change them .
who are these people and these groups ?
almost invariably you will find that they are the social reactionaries , communalists , those who want favours and privileges for themselves at the expense of the larger community .
the british government of india have become the self - constituted guardians of hindu and muslim customs and traditions .
the problem before us is the problem of the conquest of power . . . .
the fundamental fact of the situation is the bayonet and baton .
how can you argue or be sweetly reasonable with cold steel and dead wood ?
the government , it is said , must preserve law and order .
it is a great work , and it may be that it will require time .
let us , at least , give it a good push oninqilab zindabad !
we are on the threshold of our revolution .
what the future will bring we cannot say .
gentle and yet brave and indomitabe , see how they set the pace for others .
and the purdah , which hid our brave and beautiful women , and was a curse to them and to their country , where is it now ?
see also the children the boys and girls the vanar senas and the bal and balika sabhas .
the parents of many of these children may have behaved as cowards or slaves in the past .
it was only due to our weakness .
i have remained silent though i felt like bursting , and now all is over .
india today cannot even save her dearly loved children from the gallows .
" who was this mata , whom they saluted and whose jai they shouted ? "
still they remained silent and puzzled .
they had never been asked these strange questions .
they had taken things for granted and shouted when they had been told to shout , not taking the trouble to understand .
if the congress people told them to shout , why they would do so , loudly and with vigour .
it must be a good slogan .
" which dharti , " i asked further , " the dharti of their village area , or of the punjab , or of the whole world ? "
they did not know and wanted to understand .
this vast country was hindustan , bharat mata , for all of us who lived in it and were her children .
bharat mata was not a lady , lovely and forlorn , with long tresses reaching to the ground , as sometimes shown in fanciful pictures .
whose jai then did we shout ?
was it then of the mountains and rivers and deserts and trees and stones of hindustan ?
' no ' they answered , but they could give me no positive reply .
" who are these people ?
empires have collapsed and crowds of princes and petty rulers have faded away .
that system has no inherent importance or strength ; it is the strength of british imperialism that counts .
therefore when conflict comes we must recognise who our opponent is .
we have recently seen what happens to international treaties and the sacred convenants when they do not suit the purposes of imperialism .
democracy and freedom were the sufferers and so it did not matter .
not to do so would imperil their position and the only alternative would be complete removal .
the map of the world has changed many times during the last hundred years ; empires have ceased to be and new countries have arisen .
even now before our very eyes we see this map changing .
does any one still hold that autocracy and corrupt administration must continue in the states ?
does any one deny that all these must go and give place to free institutions ?
the full establishment of civil liberties is an essential preliminary to any progress .
are the middle ages to continue in india under the protection of british imperialism ? . . , .
among other things they have learnt the art of utilising communal differences to check popular movements .
in painful contrast with this general poverty and wretchedness , the rulers of both are probably the two richest individuals in india . . . .
it is distressing that in these two great states such conditions should prevail .
it was natural that in both of them popular movements should grow up and spread to the masses .
our movement long ago passed the stage of protest in our national affairs and we took to constructive action .
it becomes essential , therefore , that we should fashion our policy accordingly and link our national struggle with that policy .
fascism crushed all progressive elements and set up new standards in cruelty and inhumanity .
sanskrit had regained its position as the language of religion , science and literature .
for higher learning there were universities at nalanda and other places at which students were given religious and secular education at the expense of the state .
among secular sciences , medicine , mathematics and astronomy were regarded to be the most important in this period .
they were taught to use the lancet for surgical operations . , to clean and dry wounds and to apply salves .
the astronomers had discovered that the stars and planets were spherical and reflected light .
they knew that the earth turned round its axis once in a day and they had calculated its radius .
the great scholars of this period occupy a high place in the history of science not only of india but of the whole world .
they preferred the risk of making hitler dominant in europe to cooperation with russia in the cause of peace . . . .
india must be vitally interested in it for it affects her own future . . . .
governments have power to shape a country ' s policy and to give it a right or wrong turn .
they change governments or compel them to act in a certain way .
it is true that this very memory of the past will cling to us and be a constant reminder to us of what we should not do .
the existence of the soviet union itself and the astonishing fight for democracy in spain are significant .
it is a question most difficult to answer for every person who cares for freedom and democracy and world peace and order .
for us in india the difficulty is no less .
we will not and cannot forget our own struggle for freedom .
will anyone dare to ask us to fight for democracy and deny us that democracy ?
yet the answer must be given , and given in clear language .
the congress , in its resolutions , has already clearly indicated what this answer must be . . . .
but we are in the midst of a crisis ? and intricate schemes cannot be evolved in a day .
a committee consisting of representatives of the people should be set up to work out the details for the election of this asssembly .
to say that anything has happened in india which leads to a parting of the ways as between britain and india is incorrect .
there was an intense dislike of fascism and nazism and no desire to see them win .
we knew each other , suspected each other , and disliked each other thoroughly .
the viceroy and the british government said " no " to us , and our course seemed to be clear .
in this world of force , of bombing aeroplanes , tanks , and armed men , how weak we are !
why trouble about us ?
this government would evolve a scheme for constituent assembly which would prepare a constitution for india acceptable to all sections of the people . . . .
a few hours later , in the early morning of august 9th , a large number of arrests were made in bombay and all over the country .
and so to ahamadnagar fort . . . .
in the early morning of august 9th 1942 , numerous arrests were made all over india .
what happened then ?
only scraps of news trickled through to us after many weeks , and even now we can form only an incomplete picture of what took place .
protests , of course , there had to be , and there were spontaneous demonstrations .
and then all these suppressed emotions broke out and crowds gathered in cities and rural areas and came in conflict with the police and the military .
for a time there seems to have been a sense of uncertainty as to what should be done .
as often happens in these circumstances , local leaders sprang up and were followed for the moment .
all over india , the younger generation , especially university students , played an important part in both the violent and peaceful activities of 1942 .
this happened particularly in bihar , in the midnapur district of bengal and in the south - eastern districts of the united provinces .
if the reaction of the crowd was natural , so also , in the circumstances , was the reaction of the government .
and from that revolt will develop that terrible thing , the third world war .
that is an inveitable development and these nations will naturally look to those who favour their freedom .
in india we stand on the verge of big developments , which - will probably be initiated more by the people than by the british government .
with this temper in the country it is not possible to carry on in the old way or to delay and procrastinate .
if a changea radical change from top to bottomdoes not come soon , a great crisis will come in its place .
the people of the indian states have moved with the rest of india .
they played a notable part in 1942 and after and today they are astir as they have never been before .
a writer has called the indian states ' britain ' s fifth column in india ' .
the history of the last hundred and fifty years justifies this nomenclature .
it is like establishing a vast network of friendly fortresses in debatable territory .
it would be difficult for a . general rebellion against the british to sweep india because of this network of powerful , loyal native states " .
frequently we criticise and blame the rulers of the states , and often they are deserving of censure .
so the first book of poetry in dingal hindi , prithvi raja raso was written at the instance of the chauhan raja of ajmer .
architecture too , made great progress under the rajputs .
but the culture which flourished during the rajput period was the culture of a warlike people in an age of chivalry .
a similar spirit pervaded the whole society .
each of the four castes was now divided into many sub - castes which claimed the entire loyalty of the individual .
no taxation or rent is justified if the income is below this limit .
then , again it must be borne in mind that no revolution can stand still .
it marches forward from step to step or it goes backward and collapses .
obviously the largest numbers ultimately mean the peasantary and the workersin the u . p . the peasantary and petty farmers .
fifthly , strength can only come in a revolutionary movement from below up , not from above down .
therefore it becomes essential that a continuous attempt be made to keep the people at the bottom of the organisation in proper form .
the congress has not definitely adopted a socialistic viewpoint although it favours it .
congressmen should stick to the no - tax campaign and not temporise or compromise on this issue .
sometimes it is stated that enquiry committees should be appointed to find out where and when to have no - tax campaign .
this also is absurd .
the congress socialist party , as its very name implies , stands for the congress and for socialists .
i have also progressively accepted the ideology of a scientific socialism and i may claim to be now a socialist in the full sense of the term .
these are : nationalism and political freedom as represented by the congress and social freedom as represented by socialism .
socialism , it is obvious , includes political freedom , for without that there can be no social and economic freedom .
to continue these two outlooks and make them an organic whole is the problem of the indian socialist .
i see no way of ending the poverty , the vast unemployment , the degradation and the subjection of the indian people except through socialism .
that means the ending of private property , except in a restricted sense , and the replacement of the present profit system by a higher ideal of cooperative service .
in short , it means a new civilization , radically different from the present capitalist order .
some glimpse we can have of this new civilization in the territories of the u . s . s . r .
the alwars played an important role in making the hindu religion a living experience for the common people in the south .
their ideas were mostly taken from the vishnu purana , bhagwad gita and other books of sacred hindu literature .
another great religious movement which arose in the south was that of shankaracharya who revived the vedantic religion through his commentary on the uttara mimamsa .
he is nirguna , i . e . free from all attributes .
all , except god , that appears to exist is mere illusion ( mayo ) .
they tried to find markets for raw materials and then they came into conflict with each other .
all this is the inevitable fruit of the present system of capitalism in the world .
capitalism in india is still not fully grown .
but capitalism itself is a world phenomenon .
we cannot separate capitalism of one country from another .
that indeed was , and is , a principal reason for our opposition to this new constitution .
we must therefore be perfectly frank with our people and tell them what we can do and what we cannot do under present conditions .
that very inability of ours becomes a powerful argument in favour of the vital change which will give us real power .
thus the attainment of national freedom and the elimination of foreign control became an essential prerequisite for planning .
we neither wanted to be victims of an imperialist power nor to develop such tendencies ourselves .
thus , while free enterprise was not ruled out as such , its scope was severely restricted .
in regard to defence industries it was decided that they must be owned and controlled by the state .
such control , however , of these industries had to be rigid .
collective farms were to be started immediately by the state on culturable waste land .
no exemption was to be allowed except for physical or mental disability .
when world war ii started in september , 1939 , it was suggested that the national planning committee should suspend its activities .
businessmen were busier than ever making money out of war requirements and were not so much interested in planning .
the situation was changing from day to day .
we decided , however , to continue and felt that the war made this even more necessary .
it was bound to result in further industrialization , and the work we had already done and were engaged in doing could be of great help in this process .
but the government was not interested in our work and . in fact viewed it with great disfavour . . . .
we were to finish what little remained of this work and then proceed to the consideration of our own comprehensive report .
i was , however , arrested in october , 1940 , and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment .
the government of india intervened and stopped this .
no such papers were allowed to reach me , nor were interviews on the subject permitted . . . .
in march three years ago ( 1936 ) i flew back to india from europe , president - elect of the congress .
but i knew well that i could not presume too much , for elections are often . governed by other considerations .
no one could say that the congress had turned socialist because the delegates had elected me their president .
it spoke a language , borrowed from western socialist literature , which was seldom understood by the rank and file of the congress .
and so though it won over some , it created a barrier against the many .
the obvious course was for all anti - imperialistic forces to function together on the common platform of the congress .
there could be no socialism before independence . . . .
some socialists , and marxists , thinking in terms of europe and its pacifists , tried to ridicule the method of non - violence .
almost everybody , including the socialists , accepted this ' as the national policy and realised that there was no alternative .
about the same time arab muslims came to sind and established their rule over the region .
the ships on which they were sailing were attacked by some pirates from kutch who seized the girls and took them away .
hajjaj urged ' dahar ' , the raja of sind to set the captives free .
it was mohammad - ibne - qasim who conquered sind and multan and annexed them to the islamic khilafat .
sind acknowledged the suzerainty of the khilafat till ad 861 .
we know something about the influence which the contact of hindus and muslims in western india had on the muslim culture in arabia .
later in the time of harun thanks to the liberalism and generosity of his barmecide ministers many books were translated from sanskrit into arabic .
sometimes he is the single - minded revolutionary going like the arrow to his goal and shaking up millions in the process .
at other times he is static , or seemingly so , counselling others to prudence .
it makes little difference whether he is formally connected with the congress or not .
the congress of today is of his making , and he is essentially of it .
in any national struggle * his full association and guidance are essential .
that is one of the basic factors of the situation .
to ' overreach the mark now might mean reaction tomorrow .
it is also essential that new india should also come in intimate contact with the world of science .
therefore it becomes essential that the two must march together .
many of you are aware of what has been happening in india during the last quarter of a century and much more recently .
a person like me who is not exactly a man of politics has to take an intimate part in political activity .
why should i go into politics ?
surely , science is not merely an individual ' s search for truth .
it is something infinitely more than that if it worked for the community .
its objective must be to remove the ills of the community .
it must have a social objective before it .
i firmly believe that it is through the method and spirit of science that we can ultimately solve our problems .
all over the world it is because we forget the scientific approach that many of our troubles arise . . . . . .
you cannot divorce science from social and political happenings and from the eccnomic structure of the world .
therefore , perhaps it is time that science developed a certain philosophy and unity , if i may put it so .
it had this quality in the olden days when science presented a smaller picture than it does now .
that gave a certain organic unity to it .
now with each department going its own way , it has become difficult .
i do think that in the present circumstances of the world we should develop something of that unity of outlook and appreciation of the world problems .
nearly two years ago a bomb burst in hiroshima .
it seemed to me to herald all kinds of enormous changes , constructive as well as destructive .
whether it was necessary or not i do not know , but obviously it led to one question which troubled a large number of people .
science has two faces like janus : science has its destructive side and a constructive , creative side .
both have gone on side by side and both still go on .
hiroshima became a symbol of this conflict . . . .
my mind goes back to the time when gunpowder burst upon the world .
of course , there were many forces at work .
you can see in different places different types of social structures .
this picture which is rapidly changing even the 20th century structure does not seem to answer the present needs .
and even where something of value still remains , it is enveloped by other and harmful contents . . . .
studying them , i realised the hold it had on such large numbers of people .
i prefer the open sea , with all its storms and tempests .
i find the problems of this life sufficienctly absorbing to fill my mind .
" but the usual religious outlook does not concern itself with this world .
this does not mean that men of religion have not been and are not still often of the highest moral and spiritual type .
words are well known to be , by themselves , very imperfect means of communication , and are often understood in a variety of ways .
it was here that several great cultures arose and others , born in asia , africa or europe , came in contact with one another .
if there was a place in the old world where the idea of a universal human brotherhood could take shape it was this central region .
islam , the new message of hope and faith which the prophet of arabia gave to the world , does not claim to be a new religion .
to explain this point the quran uses the terms din and shariah .
shariah is the positive law through which a particular religion realises at a given time the common eternal ideal .
din has always been the same and will continue to be the same .
but shariahs have been different for different peoples at different times .
this use of the same word with different meanings makes mutual comprehension still more difficult .
a very modern definition of religion , with which the men of religion will not agree , is that of professor john dewey .
remain holland also has stretched religion to mean something which will probably horrify the orthodox of organised religions .
the original source of the teachings of islam is the quran which was revealed to the holy prophet mohammed .
the traditions of the prophet ( 1 ) the concept of god , which is inferred from that of the universe .
the universe is subject to the law of causality ; so is human action .
every action of man has a fixed recompense ( jaza ) which he usually gets in this life .
so we see that the concept of the attributes of god in the quran is associated with a particular concept of the world ( weltanschauung ) .
the quran visualises the world as one of reward and retribution which is based on justice tempered with mercy .
there is much difference of opinion about the date of the beginning of his rule .
but most probably he ascended the throne in ad 78 , which marks the commencement of the saka era .
about the same time the andhras or satavahanas founded on the ruins of the mauryan empire an empire , of their own which continued for 400 years .
in the later part of the vedic hindu period , the religious life of the country had lost its balance .
the simon commission , as is well known , met with a widespread and almost unanimous boycott in india .
granting this power of gift , every cry other than one of seeking the government ' s favours is futile .
the inevitable consequence , and bhaiji accepts this , is what he calls " hindu nationalism " , which is but another name for hindu communalism .
what is the way to this ?
cooperation with british imperialism .
not only that , no resolution on the political or economic objective was considered .
if the mahasabha claims to represent the hindus of india , must it be said that the hindus are not interested in the freedom of india ?
the mahasabha seems to live in a world of its own unconnected with the struggles and desires and sufferings of the indian people . . . .
at the most it means jobs for a few of our unemployed intellectuals .
how do these ' communal demands meet the needs of the masses ?
those who , in my opinion , are helping in this attempt , may be perfectly honest in the beliefs they hold .
but none the less the beliefs may be wrong , anti - national and reactionary .
i write as an individual , and , in this matter , i claim to represent no one but myself .
many may agree with me ; i hope they do .
but whether they do so or not , i must say frankly what i have in my mind .
i read it with much hope that it will , to an extent , help in understanding and solving this difficult question .
if some others also have understood it the way bhaiji has done , then is it a surprise that there is so much of misunderstanding ?
as examples , he has given the time wher islamic rule prevailed in india and the cases of egypt and iran .
in a short article bhaiji has , in my opinion , written something very controversial and wrong and one feels like saying something about it .
there is yet another aspect of the word swarajya what should be the relation political , economic , social and cultural between the people within the country ?
this leads to many complicated issues and there are varied opinions on this .
in the present - day world , in most countries ( excepting those which are fascist ) the people would opt for democracy .
this also is of different types should it be mere political democracy or economic and social democracy too ?
such questions as capitalism and communism arise here .
what is the aim of the congress ?
first , naturally , that our country be independent , politically and economically , as other countries are .
this means our cultural , social and religious freedom is included in it and no outsider has any right to interfere with them .
our country will decide for itself what it wants .
f what is the aim of the congress within india ?
it is a bit more difficult to reply , except that it is in favour of political democracy .
it has not decided anything further , which to a great extent means that it does not want to make any change in the present set - up .
on economic and social problems some congressmen favour communism , some capitalism and some others something else .
most of the congress leaders favour modern capitalism and do not want much change in that .
but where does bhai parmanand ' s question of giving up one ' s ' self arise ?
would bhaiji retain it in hinduism ?
which of these are to be included in hinduism ?
it can be argued ' that these are spurious rules and to know the real ones we should go to the vedas or to our philosophy .
many hindus will not agree that these spurious rules be given no importance .
it should also be stated frankly in what way , in their opinion , the congress is sacrificing this ' self .
it means that bhaiji thinks that modern european imperialism is for propagation of christianity !
even a school child would not commit such a folly .
how are imperialism and religion related ?
abyssinia is a christian country , the oldest christian country , converted long before europe .
why then did italy attack her ?
why also did the last great war take place between the christian countries of europe ?
ireland also has been a christian country for more than a thousand years .
why has british imperialism been suppressing ireland for the last seven hundred years ?
bhaiji talks of egypt and iran who lost their identity and absorbed themselves in the foreign community .
this iranian culture was so impressive that it had its incessant influence from west asia to china .
now let us have a quick look at the ancient history of our country .
hundreds of years before the aryan entry , here flourished a high - class culture , a sample of which we get at mohenjodaro .
they compromised on customs , religion and gods .
then many races , specially the turkish , invaded this land and settled here .
in rajputana and kathiawar , many of our royal families have turkish blood .
there was no question of any other religion in those days , because all these turks were buddhists from central asia .
still they brought many customs and usages from there .
in what way are the interests of the muslim peasant different from those of the hindu peasant ?
religious questions may arise and religious conflicts may take place , and they should be faced and settled .
to encourage a communal consideration of political and economic problems is to encourage reaction and go back to the middle ages .
it is an impossible attempt , for it ignores realities .
the realities of today are poverty and hunger and unemployment and the conflict between british imperialism - and indian nationalism .
the congress represents indian nationalism and is thus charged with a historic destiny .
then there are bengali , marathi , and gujarati , sister languages of hindi and nearly allied to it .
in the south there are tamil , telugu , kannada , and malayalam .
besides these there are oriya , assamese , and sindhi , and punjabi and pushtu in the north - west .
without infringing in the least on the domain of the provincial languages , we must have a common all - india medium of communication .
but this is manifestly impossible if we think in terms of the masses .
we cannot educate millions of people in a totally foreign tongue .
the only possible all - india language is hindustani .
even those who do not know it at all at present can learn it far more easily than a foreign language .
this makes it what is hindustani ?
is this just an idea with no reality for its basis , or is it something more ?
therefore wisely we have agreed that both should have full play .
but we have to put up with these disadvantages , for any other course is not open to us .
but in spite of these advantages i do not think there is the slightest chance of the latin script replacing devanagari or urdu .
but there are more solid grounds also for its rejection .
the scripts are essential parts of our literatures ; without them we would be largely cut off from our old inheritance .
it should be easily possible to have a common script for these four languages .
we want both and we must accept both . we must realise that the growth of hindi means the growth of urdu and vice versa .
the two will powerfully influence each other and the vocabulary and ideas of each will grow .
but each must keep its doors and windows wide open for these words and ideas .
we must not , therefore , even look upon the separate development of hindi and urdu with suspicion .
nevertheless , though we tolerate willingly this existing separtism , we must help in the process of this unification .
our writers , therefore , must think in terms of a mass audienece and clientele and must deliberately seek to write for them .
we have not yet fully recovered from the notion that culture and literary attainments are the products and , accompaniments of courtly circles .
culture today must have a wider mass basis , and language , which is one of the embodiments of that culture , - must also have that basis .
this approach to the masses is not merely a question of simple words and phrases .
but the choicest of the translations has been that of " imperial preference . "
this was called by an enterprising journalist shahi pasand . . . .
they should be the principal languages for those areas . . . .
there is no question of any of these languages being suppressed by hindustani .
for over a large area however in the north , hindustani , with its variations , holds sway .
i am not against english or other foreign languages .
i think a knowledge of foreign languages is essential for us to keep in touch with the world and with modern thought .
but that knowledge can never extend to large numbers of people in the country .
and thus hindustani is going to be the national language of india .
but an even more vital difference is that between the city language and that of the rural areas .
to some extent this is bound to continue and it is right that the higher cultural standard of the city should play an important part .
but as education spreads in the rural areas this predominance of the city will not be so marked and our language will undergo a considerable change . . . .
there is a tremendous difference between the language of lucknow city and the rural areas of lucknow .
what then is this simple common language of the people ?
instead of being a little ashamed of his ignorance or of his limited knowledge , he seems to glory in the fact that he does not understand something .
- the simple common language of the people is always a limited language .
probably it consists of about two thousand words .
we have to go outside its range to discover the requisite words and phrases to express uncommon ideas .
i find it quite absurd when i learn that people want to suppress a language or script anywhere .
that shows utter ignorance of national growth and the part that language plays in it . . .
it is curious how many things in our country take a communal tinge .
even the language question has become communal .
i consider urdu as my . language which i have spoken from my childhood up .
unfortunately for myself my education was such that i know neither urdu nor hindi properly .
we cannot create an artificial language like this and impose it on the whole of india .
indeed this tendency is a world - wide one .
indeed these variations must be encouraged and helped .
we do not want a drab uniformity in india but a wide and varied life bubbling over with rich vitality .
their record of work has been nil except for the mere criticism of the congress and exploiting the masses in the name of religion .
these organisations have never participated in actual fight , which would have demonstrated their real worth .
i would like to know what campaigns were launched by the hindu mahasabha and the muslim league ? . . . .
* i ask only one question from the leaders of communal organisations .
what part have they taken during the last twenty five years , particularly during the last three years , in the struggle for the freedom of india ?
in that struggle of the nation , hindus and muslims suffered alike .
it was a big event in the history of the country when the entire nation spontaneously rose like a flood in the river .
the only thought which pervaded the nation then was the freedom of the country , and none other .
socialism in the west and the rising nationalism of the eastern and other dependent countries opposed this combination of fascism and imperialism .
where do we stand , then , we who labour for a free india ?
can we not see an organic connection in all these various phenomena ?
i venture therefore to state a little more fully what my attitude is to this problem of palestine .
i approach this question therefore with every sympathy for the jews .
for them also it was a holy landboth for the muslim and the christian arabs .
for thirteen hundred years or more they had lived there and all their national and racial interests had taken strong roots there .
palestine was not an empty land fit for colonisation by outsiders .
the problem of palestine is thus essentially a nationalist one - a people struggling for independence against imperialist control and exploitation .
indeed some of the most prominent leaders of the arabs in this national struggle have been christians .
instead they have chosen to side with british imperialism and to seek its protection against the people of the country .
as we take this long view the arab - jew question fades into insignificance .
our fate in india is bound up with them more than we realise .
what has happened in spain ?
some months ago there were normal democratic elections there and as a result a popular radical party a joint popular front came into power .
it was not a communist or even socialist government .
there was not a single communist or socialist in it .
in this vital issue we find the ruling classes and government of britain definitely favouring fascism .
between imperialist and fascist powers there is also inherent conflict for many of them want a greater share in the spoils of exploitation .
but despite this mutual conflict they sympathise with and aid each other as against the social urge to freedom and the nationalist struggle for political freedom .
and thus we find the indian struggle for independence a part of this world struggle against imperialism and fascism .
and ' watched at close quarters the difficult and intricate game of how to betray your friend ' .
he ' followed this game . . . from london , paris and geneva ' .
it meant the strengthening of the soviet union and releasing of popular forces all over the world .
the class sympathies of the british government made them view the soviet union with horror and inclined them towards nazism and fascism .
they are not even called .
in france , the news of one deed spreads like a flash and brings some pride to a disillusioned people .
henceforth , he considers himself a czech citizen .
they were proud that one brave frenchman had said frankly what he thought and braved the consequences .
they had been fooled long enough by these ministers and governments of theirs .
it is they and their sons and brothers and husbands who will die , and their children and wives and mothers and sisters who will be bombed .
manchuria , abyssinia , czechoslovakia , spainit was a sorry tale of misfortune and disaster , and always i seemed to be on the wrong side .
that leads us of course to consider what is realism or reality .
is the temporary advantage of the moment to be the test or should we have a longer perspective ?
if i deserted them , what would i cherish in india , for what kind of freedom do we struggle here ?
but article published in national herald , 20 august 1939 ; reproduced from selected works , volume 10 , pp . 81 - 83 .
is it war or not ?
after long hesitation i decided to go to china .
it was easy to go there and come back quickly if need arose .
in this atomic age asia will have to function effectively in the maintenance of peace .
we should work for that ideal and not for any grouping which comes in the way of this larger world group .
we must help them to their rightful place in the human family .
we think also of that great figure whose labours and whose inspiration have brought india to the threshold of her independencemahatma gandhi .
we miss him at this conference and i yet hope that he may visit us before our labours end .
he is engrossed in the service of the common man in india , and even this conference could not drag him away from it .
all over asia we are passing through trials and tribulations .
in india also you will see conflict and trouble .
let us not be afraid of them , but rather welcome them ; for , only with their help can we build the new asia of our dreams .
let us have faith in these great new forces and the dream which is taking shape .
let us , above all , have faith in the human spirit which asia has symbolized for those long ages past .
the first object of this union would be to collect data and give publicity to it .
other activities such as the organisation of public opinion to resist all encroachments on civil liberties would follow .
it is essential that people holding different political views should come on a common platform wherever possible and work for a common cause .
the executive of the national council of the indian civil liberties union will lay down the general policy on which the union will work .
the details of work will , of course , fall on the local committees .
the union is not meant to be a mass organisation , though there is no restriction on anyone becoming a member .
it does not even possess the virtue of success .
history is full of such examples .
evil flourishes far more in the shadows than in the light of day .
but what is good and what is evil may itself be a doubtful matter , and who is then to decide ?
he spent these two years in prison in philosophic and literary work .
you must not take what i have written in these letters as the final authority on any subject .
these letters of mine are but superficial sketches joined together by a thin thread .
even so , what we get is seldom a straight answer .
the old days were days of faith , blind , unquestioning faith .
but the days of that faith are gone , and gone with them is that magic touch in stone .
thousands of temples and mosques and cathedrals continue to be built , but they lack the spirit that made , them live during the middle ages .
and yet how we appreciate these common things of life when we have naved without them for a while !
for you
the darwin centre reveals the museum ' s scientific work : our specimens , research and outreach activities .
the science work in the darwin centre is intimately linked with the specimens stored there .
for researchers , the biggest advantages are the high quality and proximity of the collections .
each floor has a preparation laboratory , where specimens can be removed from the cold stores and worked on at room temperature .
scientific tools
the laboratories have dissection equipment , microscopes and chemical analysis facilities .
the darwin centre has laboratory space for visiting researchers , who come from all over the world to study the museum ' s specimens .
each floor of the darwin centre contains a specialist library for the researchers that work there .
in addition to its state - of - the - art scientific facilities , the building has also been designed for maximum environmental efficiency .
the building has an air - filled cushion roof , making it very lightweight .
also , the layer of air is a good insulator , making the roof thermally efficient .
why do we keep our specimens here ?
history
how did the natural history museum come to have such large and important collections ?
who works at the museum ?
why do they choose to do this work ?
how did they start on their scientific career ?
collecting is part of human nature , and has occurred across a range of cultures through history .
for the collections held in the natural history museum , ideas about their value has changed over time .
each specimen is a marriage of data and natural object , and is placed in the collection with reference to its similarity to other specimens .
the scale of the collections means that we can make comparisons across a large number of specimens .
we vigorously develop the collections , adding thousands of specimens to them each year .
this maintains and enhances their use as a powerful knowledge resource .
worldwide value
the knowledge held here is used by researchers globally .
in turn , this generates new knowledge and , indeed , often new collections .
new dna collection
for example , we have begun making a dna collection , freezing pieces of animal and plant tissue .
collections made by some of the uk ' s most famous explorers and scientists are kept in the museum .
these include :
for these , our conservation laboratory is skilled in making exact replicas for study and display .
our mammal curators can identify a specimen from one of its hairs alone .
but this kind of knowledge comes with years of experience .
what is special about specimens ?
the best way to identify anything is to compare it with others .
this is why the collection here is the best tool a taxonomist has to identify an organism .
we identify different living things in different ways .
not every specimen has full information with it .
when researchers leave , the specimens they leave behind become vital references for interpreting their writings and concepts .
type specimens
what are type specimens and why are they so important to the museum .
no researcher works alone , and results are shared among the wider community .
how do scientists communicate ?
how can we generate information from our collections and data ?
what kind of technology do we use for our analyses ?
how do researchers use our collections , libraries and expertise in their studies ?
there are many different ways to examine the natural world , from satellites to microscopes .
what techniques do we use ?
peer - reviewed journals are the backbone of science .
the scientific articles published there have all been checked for reliability by other groups of scientists .
these are often also published online .
another important medium is the conference .
formal papers are published as ' proceedings ' , but it is also an opportunity for informal communication .
great ideas
many research projects have come from a casual remark at a conference planting the seed of an idea in a member of the audience .
communicating with the public
researchers work with other communicators to ensure accuracy .
through initiatives such as the darwin centre , and events such as national science week researchers interact directly with the public .
participate in a live encounter with museum scientists .
resources - the specimens
the museum has three core resources for carrying out its work : the specimens , the libraries and the expert researchers .
our libraries are crucial to our research and curation .
as well as holding current journals containing relevant modern work , they contain a vast historical archive .
touch one . . .
taxonomy requires a great deal of expertise .
our work could not continue without the resource of experts on our staff .
it can take many years for a junior curator to fully know a collection and its specimens .
it takes expert knowledge to tell species apart .
how do our curators use the collection for identification ?
collecting specimens - land
we use different techniques to collect different types of plants , fish and insects .
the way we collect aims to minimise damage to the environment .
collecting specimens - water
fish are collected using a variety of techniques , depending on the size of the fish and the environment you are collecting in .
the more similar the sequences are , the more closely the organisms are related .
this kind of molecular analysis is adding a new type of knowledge to our collections , increasing the number of ways that our specimens can be used .
malaria and dna
researchers are using dna analysis techniques to classify the different mosquitoes that transmit malaria .
analysis - molecular
when analysing gene fragments , scientists usually use a technique called electrophoresis .
analysis - computing power
computers have transformed analysis of the groupings of organisms .
numerical analysis that would take months , or years , by hand is now carried out in minutes by desktop computers .
imagine trying to use evidence from many different analytical tools to work out the possible relationships between a number of species .
each experiment must be repeatable .
only when it has passed many tests does a hypothesis about the world become considered ' true ' .
another key scientific principle is falsifiability .
this means that something is only true as long as no evidence has come along to disprove it .
a proper scientific hypothesis must be capable of being disproved .
of course , the process involves debate and counter argument as new struggles against old .
few experiments can be as clear - cut as we would like , and it takes time to build up conclusive evidence .
there are few projects that answer one question without suggesting several more . . .
there are always more questions than researchers to study them .
geoff boxshall , museum scientist , has collected specimens in different parts of the lake , using diving equipment and submersible craft .
scientists use a wide range of tools to collect specimens .
he found that most of the lake baikal species are endemic - they occur nowhere else .
why should lake baikal contain so many species not found anywhere else ?
certain species also live at particular depths .
how do these two facts lead to an idea about how these diacyclops species evolved ?
what is the scanning electron microscope ?
what can it tell us about a specimen ?
this is the way of peace of mind , higher wisdom , illumination and nirvana . ' '
the buddha looked deep into the human mind and examined the nature of the feeling of pain .
the higher purpose of life is the perfect peace of mind to which buddha gave the name nirvana .
the buddha showed the way to self - restraint instead of self - mortification , to right action instead of inactivity .
even in hindu states like the maratha empire , which had modelled its administration on the mughal empire , the official language was persian .
the east india company had persian as the official language till 1819 when it was declared to have been replaced by english .
for literary and scientific purposes educated hindus as well as muslims used persian and even ordinary correspondence was carried on in that language .
from the point of view of literary and scientific progress it was a disappointing period .
though the number of books written was by no means less than in the preceding period , their general level was much lower .
the creative impulse as well as the spirit of enquiry was almost exhausted .
the highest objective of scholars was now to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and to preserve what they had left behind .
some of these books were written in devanagari characters using a few sanskrit words instead of the more difficult arabic and persian ones .
this helped in standardising high hindi .
architecture and the fine arts also suffered from the decline of the mughal empire .
warren hastings not only had a thorough knowledge of english and the european classics but also knew sanskrit and persian .
after that it set up fort william college for the training of its civil servants but paid no attention to public education for some time .
under this scheme two new institutions , agra college and delhi college , were set up .
but this scheme met with little success .
after 1857 the picture suddenly changed .
their rulers too with their traditional contempt for all physical and moral weakness , now looked down on indians and their culture .
there were many opponents of foreign intellectual and political domination , but they no longer dared to come out in the open .
their only refuge where they could be safe from the wrath of the government was religion .
so they lived a retired life in religious schools and monasteries .
the natural consequence of this policy was that in the cultural field too , the british aimed at domination instead of reconciliation .
to enforce this policy the government had neither the inclination nor the need to employ the crude methods of the east india company .
indians were associated with them only as customers or as labourers and clerks .
formula - repeating parrots were even more uneducated than rhyme - reciting parrots .
otherwise , generally those educated in modern western educational institutions were like the products of the old - fashioned oriental seminaries .
the one mental faculty which was cultivated was passive memory .
the powers of reflection , reasoning , inquiry , criticism and the practical application of knowledge to life were starved out .
only in two respects were the graduates of the western type of universities better than those of the oriental seminaries .
casting yearning looks at the clubs of the real sahibs they played billiards , tennis , and cards in their own consolation clubs .
the more emancipated entertained themselves with european wines and if they could find an equally emancipated partner , with european dances .
many of them constructed tanks and temples hoping to be absolved of the sins committed by them during the course of their trade .
there was a big gap between the rich and the poorthe rich enjoying all the luxuries and the poor toiling day and night for their daily bread .
and yet the rich were the most respected in society .
the brahmins and the rich had easy access to the king and were able to get their work done .
it was the low , the poor and the casteless that were the real sufferers .
among the lower castes , there were again diffetcnt rungs and each caste had us own social privileges which it guarded zealously .
in ancient karnataka region , an individual was merely a part of the community to which he belonged .
his individuality had a value so long as he did not do anything against his caste rules .
the common belief was that the kitchen was her school , the husband her god and devotion to her husband the means of her salvation .
the position of the untouchables was pitiable .
the other castes did not mix with them and treated them with utter contempt .
they were not allowed to pursue any decent occupation .
they formed the major labour class and many of them were regular slaves attached to aristocratic families .
they wore dirty clothes , lived in thatched huts and ate the flesh of dead cattle .
these they would sell and make their living .
there were numerous superstitious beliefs in society some of them quite harmless , a few quite dreadful .
there were a number of minor gods and goddesses who had a large following among the lower castes .
these gods were believed to inhabit places like trees , field - boundaries , rivers , tanks , wells , bows and utensils .
here again the common , uneducated man was com - plecely exploited by priests .
the people were constantly kept in fear and were forced to be at the mercy of the priests .
the priests had no special love of gods ; to them , it was a way of making an easy living .
as allama . a contemporary of basava , has satirically remarked , " religion was the best business " .
the downfall of the ganga kingdom was 9 severe blow to jainism , as we saw earlier .
pashupatba shaivisrn was striving hard to become popular , and this along with the shrivaishnavism of ramanuja posed a serious threat to jainism .
this sect - believes that women are not entitled to final liberation in this birth .
by proper and righteous action they could be re - born as men in their next birth and get final liberation .
each man should toil for himself towards final liberation and he may have to take many births before he can attain it .
ramanuja was a man of liberal outlook .
his parents were rich and affectionate .
being the son of a leader , he enjoyed a special position among children .
perhaps the very life of comfort which be could enjoy made him see the world with a different eye .
during the nagapanchami festival , he himself had poured milk and ghee over an image of naga ( serpent - god ) and worshipped it .
but when a real snake appeared , his own people who had worshipped its image had hastened to kill it .
this was something which his young mind could not understand .
he himself had assisted his father in worshipping fire .
but when something caught fire , it was put out by sand and water .
channayya was a servant in karikala chola ' s stables .
karikala chola himself was a great devotee of shiva , but unfortunately he did not know that a greater devotee was serving under him .
the king was taken aback and he came in search of that great man ' s hut .
what was of real importance was the sincerity of purpose and the devotion with which men strove to realise god .
jusi as a mother loves her disabled child more , god , after all , may have a partiality towards the poor and the downtrodden .
a knowledge of the scriptures might be an aid to god - realisation .
we are not suggesting here that basava thought of these things in a logical manner .
it was expected of a student to memorise and recite them in the prescribed manner .
basava intensely disliked this system .
basava felt that even the vedas proclaimed the greatness of god and of bhakti as opposed to the common belief that they glorified karma .
this traditional education satisfied the scholar in him ; but the bhakta in him had his desires unfulfilled .
as days went by , basava found it impossible to observe all the " rahminical rites .
he was quite conscious of the fact that the lower - caste people were being ill - treated by the upper - caste people .
the temple there was presided over by a sthanika or temple official whose name was ishanya guru .
the name suggests that he belonged to lakulisha - pashupata shaiva sect , and was a monk residing in the temple premises .
he noticed basava ' s deep attachment to god .
he was perhaps the first to recognise the greatness of basava .
we do not know where his elder sister went .
she stayed , perhaps , in ( he village of kudalasangama with a family who took pity on her .
basava would get up early in the morning and bring fresh flowers and water .
the temple became everything ' to him .
restrictions and regulations there were none .
he was mad after god and the way he worshipped was not in accordance with the shasiras .
in short , nothing interested him except god .
the temple officials and the people appreciated his devotion .
the people from villages around used to flock to kudala - sangama once a year for witnessing the kapilashashthi festival .
they would witness for hours together basava singing and dancing in divine ecstasy .
he would sit with them and talk of shiva and his men .
this is not to say that he was unhappy in kudalasangama .
he was , on the contrary , fully convinced that he could , as an individual , rise to great spiritual heights and attain for himself moksha or liberation .
the temple authorities also treated him with respect .
all this was quite an attraction .
but his inner voice began to urge him to go out into the larger world and work for humanity .
besides , he was aware that he was under the . care of the temple and that he was a dependant .
basava decided to go there .
the shifting of the capital had a powerful impact on basava and his activities .
now he was a bigger , more powerful officer sooking after a richer treasury .
manga - liveda was a small town ; kalyana was a big city , teeming with life .
it gave an impetus to the social revolution basava had started in mangaliveda .
kalyanathe capital of the chalukyasis now a small town in bidar district and is named after basava as basavakalyana .
there are caves and temples where basava , akkanagamma , allamaprabhu and other saints of the age are believed to have done their tapas or religious meditation .
we have also seen the wonderstruck vijnanesh - wara ' s description of that city .
a dozen or more inscriptions of the place give us a picture of its vastness and the brisk trade that was going on there .
as a subordinate official , basava was unquestionably loyal to bijjala .
he had scant respect for the bhavis , and this is evident from many of his writings .
this makes us infer that he was a loyal official under a superior for whom he had little respect .
basava was caught up in this conflict and he has given clear expression to it in his compositions .
his position made him an important person and this could and did help bis , movement .
those who earn merit here , earn there also , and those who earn not here , earn neither there ; o kudala sangama lord !
it was this philosophy which tied him to this world , made him take up a job , and also be the leader of a great social movement .
basava ' s revolutionary thoughts had their roots deep in the accumulated popular discontentment regarding the then existing social and religious conditions .
it is no wonder then that the majority of people who accepted and acted upon his teachings came from the poorer sections of society .
the established religious as well as the social organisations opposed him and even tried to nip basava ' s revolution in the bud .
the religion which he preached and the way he preached it were both simple and appealing .
this is your inward purity ;
" the temple is sthavara , immovable , and hence suggested stagnation and death .
the body , which is jangama , the moving temple , suggests life and growth .
make your body the temple of god , " said basava .
for , a devotee ' s real love of god is tested not in public , but in privacy , where he is left alone with god .
the occupation which a person took up should serve as an aid to his religious practices and an aid to realise god .
" we should realise him through the work we do , " said allama .
the person who took up a particular job should do it with sincerity and should share a part of his earnings with the jangomas and the poor .
kayaka also implied that no occupation was inferior or superior to another .
all were of equal status and people who did their jgbs well were entitled to respect .
contemporary literature gives an interesting list of occupations taken , up by basava ' s followers .
there were others who pursued different occupations and all of them came to kalyana and were inspired by the teachings of basava .
yet , they participated in religious discussions and expressed themselves freely .
he did not have the power to impose rules upon society and usher in a democratic way of life .
the rich people always thought of their wealth and did not have much time to think of god .
that is why basava warned his followers not to be mad after money .
the rich people ' s love of god was a show and a sham .
basava said , " look at their houses : they are huts .
look at their minds : they are great . "
he enjoined them not to ill - treat a poor devotee , but to invite him and offer him hospitality .
basava generously gave everything he had in the cause of his religion .
he prayed god to bless him with riches so that he could go on distributing them among the needy and himself always remain a poor man .
vachanas of the finest literary value have been composed by akkamahadevi , ranimahadevi , mukthayakka and lakkamma .
akkamahadevi had made up her , mind not to marry any mortal being , because in her very childhood she had chosen god for her husband .
she was forced to marry a king with whom she found it impossible to live and at the same time love god .
she was bold enough to divorce her husband and come out of the palace .
thereafter she lived the life of a wandering mystic .
we read stories of women who took to religious practices along with their husbands .
many of them were well read and participated in religious discussions that took place at basava ' s house .
a proper atmosphere was created for women to realise their potentialities and participate in social activities .
some of the social reforms which basava brought about are strikingly new and compel our admiration .
the ideals he preached were translated into practice , and we have evidence to show that people at large did understand him and did follow him .
in the history of kar - nalaka it was certainly the first revolution worth the name .
it is basava ' s intellectual and spiritual conflicts which make the story of his life most interesting .
if basava criticised society for its shortcomings , he criticised himself more severely for his own defects .
they say that shiva is fond of the veda ,
ravana , who was the author of nada ,
gone was the head of brahma who read the veda .
god ' s grace descends upon a person who prays with love and loves him whole heartedly .
we observed earlier that basava severed all his earthly connections and came to kudalasangama where god became everything to him .
my father thou , my mother too ;
god ' s silence was a mystery to basava and he woadered whether he would ever be able to see him .
he called himself a servant of society , a watchman , a sweeper .
in the religious discussions which took place in his house , he never occupied the front seat .
he taught his followers to be courteous to guests .
allamaprabhu , another contemporary of basava , described basava as a ladder leading to heaven .
many miracles were attributed to him during his own life - time .
but , to us , the fact that he was able to bring about a revolution in the very thinking of the people is a great miracle .
put differently , it amounts to saying that there were others but for whose solid support the revolution would not have been the success it was .
basava , in his childhood , enjoyed all the love and affection of his parents .
in his later vachanas , he has disowned his parents and has called himself an illegitimate child of the servants of channayya .
let us first have a look at the ordinary people who visited his house , and then go on to some of the mystics and leaders of the movement .
there was a devotee called mahadevi shetty , a merchant , in kalinga ( modern orissa ) .
somebody sang before him a song which goes thus : " i feel i am a poor man when people do n ' t ask gifts of me .
let me be cursed if i fail to give that which is asked of me . '
he was surprised to listen to an oath of this kind and he decided to test basava by asking for cart - loads of gold , pearls and rubies .
caught in this conflict , he asked basava for cart - loads of grains .
there were people who took advantage of basava ' s goodness .
a few thieves , dressed like devotees of shiva , came to him and accepted his hospitality .
instead of wearing the linga , they had tied small brinjals in a piece of cloth and had them on their body .
he fell in love with a young lady called kamalathe and spent a few happy years with her .
he showed them the path to god .
he consoled and comforted the weeping mukthayakka who had lost her dear brother , and made a mystic of her .
he met people like goggayya and siddharama and taught them the true significance of linga worship .
he was undoubtedly the central figure in the seminars which took place in basava ' s house .
allama and others had great respect for her and they wanted to show to the world that she was a true devotee of god .
akkamahadevi came to kalyana and met people in basava ' s house .
the answers she gave convinced people that it was her genuine love of god that had prompted her to flout an established social institution like marriage .
basava celebrated her marriage with god in his home and it seemed as if her connection with god was formalised there .
from kalyana , she went to shrishaila of andhra pradesh and became one with her lord there .
akkamahadevi has composed some of the finest vachanas which are lyrical in nature .
they tell us of all the turmoil and conflict she experienced in her spiritual journey .
he was a devotee of god and belonged probably to the lakulisha - pashupatha shaiva sect .
he was a social worker with the zeal of a missionary .
he constructed a huge temple there and installed shiva ' s image .
he constructed a huge reservoir which is still in tact in sholapurfor ' the benefit of men , beasts , insects and all ' .
he was a kind man who rescued many poor people from their debts .
he arranged mass marriages in his temple and helped poor people perform their marriages with minimum expenditure .
his contemporaries looked upon him as god himself .
sakalesha madarasa was a senior contemporary of basava .
he came from shrishaila and spent some time in kalyana .
he was a great musician and played on instruments like ravanahasta , kinnaravine , kaccha - pavine and saranga vine .
he was a composer ofvacha - nas also .
basava was an admirer of sakalesha madarasa and has borrowed many ideas and phrases from him .
he used to wash the clothes of the devotees of shiva residing in kalyana and that was his kayaku .
he was a fiery man and was not afraid of even the king .
as one story goes , he refused to wash the clothes belonging to the royal family .
the king wanted to punish him , but in vain .
the untouchables were expected to announce their coming into the town .
it would not be enough to overcome the almost inevitable inefficiency of justice according to law .
but far - reaching changes are certainly impossible while the regime of individualism upon which the prevailing ideal is based is considered desirable .
those who speak of judicial inefficiency are usually unaware of the highly artificial meaning of the conception .
the law is efficient in civil suits when it enters judgement and issues execution as expeditiously as possible .
as a result of the humanitarianism which is the necessary corollary of the present individualism a whole series of obstacles arise in the enforcement of execution .
since it is difficult to secure radical alternation of fundamental social institutions , the reform of judicial administration usually concerns itself with adjustments of the judicial machinery .
reforms of procedure are far more frequent than changes of substantive law .
perhaps that is one of the reasons why the results frequently leave so much to be desired .
it is true that the distinction between substantive law and procedure to a great extent is artificial .
in general the creation of new courts or the appointment of additional judges to existing courts is a very frequent expedient in reforms .
its popularity with politicians arises from the fact that it increases their patronage by providing new offices to ' fill .
changes in steps in procedure often have the curious result of increasing the congestion of the courts at least for some time .
a great deal of litigation is often necessary to settle their effect .
the fundamental puzzle of procedural reform is the indispensability of any one particular device .
the modern tendency certainly has no forms of social control .
arrears in courts popular dissatisfaction with the administration of justice has certainly not been less in the twentieth than in previous centuries .
in a period of particularly accelerated tempo , it would seem easy to explain the prevailing dissatisfaction in terms of institutional transitions .
if , however , the phenomenon is constant , it can hardly be explained entirely as the result of changing conditions .
an explanation solely in terms of sociological differentials can be adequate only if more fundamental factors are absent .
fielding is the most ignored and neglected aspect of indian cricket .
this has been the bane of indian cricket .
excluding a bad fielder in any class of cricket is the only way to improve the situation .
had these wickets been taken , i would have had to make a delicate decision the same evening .
i requested amarsinh and mankad not to take any wicket that day .
they carried out my instructions .
the next day i made the right decision and won the match by an innings .
had these two bowlers lacked discipline , i would not have been in the position to make a correct decision .
a is far away from the ball but is an outstanding fielder .
the wicket - keeper must be physically very fit and should be able to move on the off and the leg sides with extreme agility .
it is an incorrect impression that since he does not have to run in the field he does not need to be agile , quick and absolutely fit .
a good wicket - keeper should never lend his gloves to another .
he should immediately shout ' side ' or ' mine ' and take the catch .
a captain ' s job is very crucial .
the selectors should choose a well - balanced team which will give a good account of itself .
this should not deter them from choosing the best side they can and facing the criticism bravely .
sunil gavaskar and vishwa - nath are our most outstanding examples .
this has now been standardized and test match grounds all over the world have only 75 yards .
these are ideal conditions for test matches but are very rarely found in any country .
new records were made , old records broken but the spectators got tired and the attendances fell .
soon australia saw the drawbacks of this system and now all matches are played to a time schedule .
he can also avoid autograph - hunters and be completely relaxed after the game .
in 1972 - 73 at least 15,000 people must have been turned away from each ground because of lack of accommodation .
crowds all over the world are partisan and that is but natural .
of all the seven cricketing countries perhaps the english crowds are the most impartial and quietest .
cricket has given me my name .
so , but for cricket , i would have been vijay thackersey .
cricket has given me fame .
what about home care of my teeth with braces ?
brush carefully after every meal with fluoride toothpaste and a soft - bristled toothbrush .
rinse thoroughly and check your teeth in the mirror to make sure they ' re clean .
take time to floss between braces and under wires with the help of a floss threader .
have your teeth cleaned every six months to keep your gums and teeth healthy .
insufficient cleaning while wearing braces can cause enamel staining around brackets or bands .
who will provide my orthodontic treatment ?
adults have 28 permanent teeth , or up to 32 including the third molars ( or wisdom teeth ) .
dental development
always clean your infant ' s gums after feedings .
wipe gums with a clean , damp cloth or gauze pad .
parents should brush children ' s teeth daily with a soft wet toothbrush and no more than a pea - sized amount of fluoride toothpaste .
schedule a dental visit between 6 - 12 months of age .
do not swallow - use no more than a pea - sized amount for children under six .
whenever possible , drink fluoridated water and always use an ada - accepted fluoridated toothpaste .
the supreme court will lose its identity as a summit court and there will be no cohesiveness and uniformity .
equally i am not in favour of curtailing in any manner whatsoever the extraordinary jurisdiction of the supreme court under article 136 .
he further observed about high court , " so also the situation in high courts is quite alarming " .
it has served to describe the almost immemorial condition of civil suits .
the procedure is too elaborate and technicalities impede the litigant at every stage .
even after an initial judgement , a number of appeals may be a further cause of delay .
where the final judgement is secured , execution is more than likely to be returned unsatisfied .
the condition is not better in the administration of criminal justice .
so far the courts had been inaccessible to them .
but now their problems can be brought before the courts and justice ensured to them through the strategy of public interest litigation .
conditions of subordinate judiciary the conditions of subordinate judiciary , which forms the backbone of the judicial structure , are pitiable .
in a philosophical sense aging starts as soon as an organism is born .
however , in a different sense and in accordance with the above definition , it starts at a particular time during the life span of an organism .
aging in the human being results from the complex interplay of physiological , psychological and social factors .
every species has its life span appropriately related to its reproductive life span and the course of development .
progressive changes that occur with age in bodily measurements and other morphological features have been recorded or experienced so well by us .
to emphasise this point , two faces are shown in fig . 1 .
on the left side , a young and on the right side , an old person .
the differences in the general appearance and that of the skin foldings are obvious .
in our day - to - day life these appearances are taken for granted as a natural happening .
signs of aging appear at a specific time in one ' s life .
the technique involves injection of the genes into a single cell using a very fine micro - needle .
research is progressing very rapidly in this direction .
in all these experiments it is assumed that dna - repair capacity is at least one of the factors contributing towards longevity .
one question that entertains the minds of scientists , is whether we can achieve immortality like the devatas in the hindu epics !
for example , a germ cell ( sperm or ovum ) can be considered as a potentially immortal cell .
in fact , several cell lines cultured in laboratories and converted into immortal ones by treatment with some chemicals are available today .
all this means that immortality , whether desirable or not , is not an impossibility .
the cells should remain live and normal but not as cancerous cells .
what would be the consequences of such changing compositions of the world populations ?
the consequences could be socio - psychological , economical and even political .
wisdom was always associated with the old ? therefore , their judgments were accepted without questioning .
a famous quotation says that ' no wise man ever wished to be younger ' .
what happens when such ' wise ' population increase in proportion in a given society ?
it is possible that such a nation or society would be greatly benefitted by such competent and wise population ? provided they are made use of by the nation .
it is also possible that with limited opportunities , there may be a competition amongst the ' old ' themselves not to talk of their conflicts with younger generations .
the ' youth ' and the aged may look at each other as competitors rather than complementing factors .
the old must know that youth was their past .
the youth must know that their future is old age .
the past must be revered and the future looked forward to .
in the words of sarvepalli radhakrishnan : " the blossom cannot deny the leaf , the leaf cannot deny the stalk nor the stalk , the root . "
this information is written down in the fertilised egg itself in the language of dna , rna and protein .
thus long - living species like human beings take considerable time to attain maturity .
similarly the period of their reproductive capacity is also significantly long .
but there are instances where rebels have appeared on the scene and acted against the accepted social norms .
they could carry society with them in their convictions and mould it according to their dreams .
basavanna was one such rare person in indian history .
the so - called biographers that are there wrote puranas , not history .
mistakenly believing in his ability to perform miracles , they deified the man and ascribed to him all kinds of occult powers .
yet these puranas happen to be our main source of information as far as the biographical outline is concerned .
the society into which basava was born was one based on the caste - system .
in the social hierarchy , the brahmins were at the top of the list and the ho / eyas or the outcastes at the bottom .
between these came other castes like the merchant , the agriculturist , the weaver , the potter and others .
socially , the brahmins formed the privileged class .
many of the dandanathas , whose names are recorded in inscriptions , were brahmins and belonged to various agraharas .
the agraharas thus became great centres of learning and boused great scholars .
it is . pertinent to mention here that basava was the son of one such leader .
the fact that brahmins were an educated and enlightened community is only one aspect of the picture .
the privileges they enjoyed as the social and religioua dictators of society made them feel superior to other castes .
they were proud of their caste and as such looked down upon other communities .
the scriptures they studied preached high ideals like equality of all human beings .
but these ideals remained mere ideals and were rarely translated into practice .
basava condemns brahmins by saying that " scriptures show one way and they ( the brahmins ) follow another " .
thus there was a hiatus between the ideal and the actual .
besides , their religion had become a set of rituals which had lost their significance .
to most of them , karma , rather than jnana or bhakti , was important .
their love of god was a mere show .
the extremity to which their ritualistic religion could go was to be seen in the various sacrifices they performed .
between the brahmin castewhich was the highest and chandalas or the untouchableswho were the lowest came numerous castes , each pursuing its own occupation .
the merchants formed their own guilds and controlled the entire economy of the land .
numerous inscriptions record their generous gifts to temples and other religious institutions .
but , as always , there were merchants who banked upon the ignorance of the poor people and exploited them .
as a result , each caste was a closed community and lived together in various streets of a town or a village .
while each caste felt itself inferior to some other caste , to compensate this , it had the satisfaction of considering itself superior to some other caste .
the position of woman in society needs some consideration
as a result , we find very few women who were well read and who could hold academic discussions with men .
one of the exceptions is saminirmadi , whose name is found recorded in one of the inscriptions belonging to the ninth or tenth century .
many women belonging to the royal families were educated , and even they paid more attention to the fine arts like music arid dancing .
we come across the story of a brahmin scholar whose daughter was totally uneducated .
there were rare exceptions like akkadevi who ruled over parts of karnataka ably and even fought wars .
this applied to the entire priestly classbrahminical and non - brahminical .
religious condition the major religions practised in karnataka during the first half of the twelfth century were : jainisru , yaishnavism , shaivism and buddhism .
these religions have their own history and have contributed to the cultural heritage of karnataka .
jainism was introduced into this area sometime during the first century b . c . or even earlier .
the dynasty which gave maximum encouragement was that of the gangas and the religion became the most dominant one during ihe ninth and tenth centuries a . d .
the jains were the earliest cultivators of the kannacta language and , as far as we know , it was the jains who produced the earliest literature in kannada .
with ibe downfall of the ganga kingdom during the end of the tenth century began the decline of jainism .
it began to lose its hold on the masses slowlv and by the twelfth century it was certainly not the most popular religion .
we have evidence to show that there were mass conversions from jainism to vaishnavism and shaivism .
we are not in a position to ascertain why this once very popular religion began to yield place to other religions .
we shall discuss later the philosophical basis and the social implications of this religion of basava .
in bagewadi , there were five hundred brahmin families , along with other families of different castes .
he could feel the difference in standards of living between the haves and the have - nots .
he himself wore good clothes , had sumptuous meals ; but he saw children , naked and ill - fed , and felt sad for them .
to most of them the name of god was only a tool to achieve their worldly ends .
thus , the boy grew more thoughtful and introspective .
he had friends and yet was lonely .
he was friendly and helpful , charming and soft - spoken .
he was their leader yet never dominated over them .
he felt that he was living in , a world of do ' s and don ' ts , a world of rules and regulations .
the desire to escape from this world began to gain momentum .
it became more and more difficult to live in a world of appearances .
he was waiting for an opportunity to give expression to his thoughts : an opportunity came soon and he seized it .
that event is perhaps the most important one in his life and it changed the whole course of his career .
he further argued that brahnwnism preached only karma and not bhakti .
he was adamant about it and even threatened to run - away from home if forced to undergo the upana - yana ceremony .
because it was not merely a question of basava being initiated into brahminism ; it was rather a question of the prestige of his family .
basava ' s mother also seems to have brought some pressure on basava through her affectionate pleadings .
he had to put up with it . the whole ceremony seemed meaningless to him . he wore the sacred thread and was taken to a teacher for education .
his formal education had begun .
we observed that his town was an agrahara where great scholars lived and taught .
there was no need for him to go out in search of teachers .
basava , on the contrary , does not seem to have worried himself much about the feelings of his father .
he was ail set to face whatever consequences awaited him .
before this confrontation could come to a head , basava ' s parents passed away .
they died , perhaps , with a sense of sorrow that their son was completely mis - guided and had missed a successful career .
the sacred thread on his body was . stifling him like a ' creeper of karma ' .
he cut it into pieces and threw it away .
that symbolised the severing of his connections with brahminism and society .
his immediate ideal , however , was to settle there and devote his entire life to the service of god kudalasangama .
basava is said to have established a new branch of shaivism called virashaivism and brought about a new social outlook .
as regards basava ' s virashaivism , there still are many controversies .
one opinion is that basava was the founder of virashaivism and the history of this religion could be traced from the middle of the twelfth century .
the other is that virashaivisin as such is quite ancient and that basava only revived it .
though it is out of place here to enter into a discussion of the merits and demerits of these opinions , it is still worth -
there is perhaps one exception : devara dasimayya whom basava prais - ed was a historical person and he lived during the middle of the eleventh century .
they have a charming literary quality and they tell us that the author was an ardent devotee of shiva .
the lives of basava and bijjala are inter - twined and the life of one had a marked impact upon that of the other .
under him served ahavamalla taila or taila ii who ruled over tardavadi country ( the present taluks of indi , sindgi and bagewadi in bijapur district ) .
taila belonged to the family of the badami chalukyas and was a very ambitious ruler .
he was justly proud of his ancestry which had played a colourful role in the history of karnataka .
taila defeated karka in 973 a . d . and declared himself a sovereign ruler .
thus the reign of the chalukyas of badami was re - established after an interval of more than two hundred years .
taila ruled from manyakheta ( modern malkhed of gulbarga district ) .
vijnaneshwara exclaims in his mtthakshara commentary that there never was and there never will be a city comparable to kalyana .
it is the same old tale of a powerful dynasty going down at one time and asserting itself later , making use of the earliest opportunity .
one branch of the above dynasty came to south india and settled in mangaliveda ( modern mangalavedhe of sholapur district of maharashtra ) as liegemen of the chalukyas .
these were the founders of the karnataka branch of the kalachuri family .
the history of the kalachuris begins with uchitha ( 925 a . d . ) .
a liegeman under the chalukyas of kalyana , he had fought many battles and gained for them many victories .
we have seen earlier that vikramaditya was the most powerful ruler among the chalukyas .
permadi , jogama ' s son , ( 1118 - 40 a . d . ) succeeded his father .
he was also the maternal uncle of someshwara iii who succeeded vikramaditya as emperor .
sorneshwara was a weak ruler and we have reasons to believe that permadi had made attempts to exploit the situation add become independent .
he and bijjtla were close relatives and were of the same age .
we saw in . the preceding chapters that he left kudala - sangama and came to mangaliveda , looking for the post of an accountant .
by then bijjaia had not yet usurped the throae : he was still a feudal lord under the chalukyas , ruling from mangaliveda .
bijjala and siddhadandanatha were pleased with bis work .
in a short time they made him the chief accountant .
basava was now a big man enjoying great wealth .
he would often wonder when he would be able to distribute it among the poor and among god ' s men .
in the meanwhile , the treasurer died and bijjala gladly made basava the chief treasury officer in his place .
the title dandanayaka suggests that he was a very high official .
he had acquired position , power and fame .
shortly after the death of his benefactor siddhadandanatha , he married his two daughters gangadevi and mayidevi ( also called nilalochane ) .
money and power had come to basava of their own accord , but had not corrupted him .
he had a soft corner for the poor and contempt for the rich .
he threw open the gates of his house and spent his money to the last penny in the cause of his religion .
the religion which he practised and propagated is called virashaivism .
' vira ' generally means a hero .
virashaivism insisted that its followers should develop single - minded devotion to one god , shiva .
this did not , however , mean that they should show disrespect to other gods .
to them , shiva is supreme .
lingayatas are those who wear a linga on their body .
maheshwarss ( i . e . , devotees of shiva ) , jangamas and lay devotees thronged his house .
all were welcome at his house at any time and any day .
the guests were provided with facilities for their ishta linga worship and were fed well .
they were very much pleased by basava , s sense of devotion and honesty .
they praised him and declared that they had never seen a greater sharana ( lit , a devoted man ) living on the earth .
we saw above that one of the oaths he took was that he would topple other religions and propagate his faith .
condemning other religions and upholding one ' s own was a commonly accepted practice of the time .
once he became a virashaiva , he would be treated as an equal .
they felt that a redeemer had appeared for their upliftment .
thousands of people came and embraced his religion .
among these were agriculturists , weavers , shoe - makers , fishermen , hunters , basket - makers , barbers , merchants , and even brahmins .
his spiritual sadhana went hand in hand with his social activities .
we do not know how long he stayed in mangaliveda .
while he was the bhandari or treasurer , many political events of far - reaching effect took place .
as we saw earlier , bijjala who usurped the chalukyan throne in 1162 a . d . moved his capital from mangaliveda . to kalyana .
as a result , basava also moved into kalyana in 1162 a . d . or earlier .
he continued to hold the same post : the only difference was that he was now the chief treasurer of an empire .
what was basava ' s reaction to bijjala ' s usurpation of the throne ?
the answer is simple we do not know .
in the beginning of his service , he was a loyal servant of bijjala .
the best thing to assume is that he took these events in his stride and went about his own work coolly and unconcernedly .
there were temples dedicated to many gods and goddesses , one of which was controlled by the kalamukhas .
there were shaivites , vaishnavites and jains .
we have reason to believe that there were buddhists too , though in small number .
it was also a great city where trade and commerce flourished .
members belonging to different castes had their own streets , and we read of a simpiga - geri or tailors ' street in one of the inscriptions .
on the whole , it was a big city bustling with life .
some of the criticism is unfair .
a lawyer , for fees , is not expected to be swayed by clients .
it is the duty of the lawyers to see that the profession is not looked down upon by the public .
litigation expenses and inordinate delays in deciding cases have become characteristic of our legal system .
the state incurs heavy costs to keep the machinery of justice in working order .
for example , kasapayya or kasavimantri was ruling the banavasi area in 1163 a . d . and was one of those who strongly supported bijjala .
barmarasa and he was no other than the son - in - law of bijjala himself .
these leaders and officials complained to bijjala that basava was spending on his own people large sums of money drawn from the state treasury .
whether those charges were purely fictitious or had an element of truth we cannot say .
all the stories recorded in virashaiva literature say that basava did take out money , jewels and clothes from the treasury and distributed them among the jangamas .
the authors have not only narrated the story ; they have even glorified basava ' s action .
these took much of his time .
but he never abandoned material work for attaining the spiritual .
the problems he faced made him ' a tougher fighter and a wiser man .
to him the world was real : the pleasures it offered were real .
the man who led the good life in this world , he thought , would be acceptable to god in the other world . .
said he :
how can you call them adepts too ' ? ,
the religious leaders were fully conscious of such problems and they tried to root out ' discrimination in all its forms .
basava denounced meaningless rituals and taught instead simple and sensible acharas or practices conducive to a clean and good life .
these include taking regular baths , brushing teeth , abstaining from violence , speaking truth , being faithful ( to one ' s husband or wife ) , etc .
keeping peace by providing a proper system for the administration of justice is the first duty of any organised state .
all were equal .
to quote basava , " no man . ever came out of ( his mother ' s ) ears . "
the man who eats carrion is a low - caste person .
he . went even to the extent of declaring that he was an illegitimate child of the servants of the harijan devotee , channayya .
kakkaya who was a close associate of basava was a harijan .
there were others like shivanagayya , whose story needs mentioning here .
on the outskirts of the city of kalyana lived the harijans .
the story goes that basava performed a miracle and proved that it was the brahmins that were corrupt at heart and not shivanagayya .
bijjala belonged to the traditional religion which accepted the varna dharma and he disliked basava ' s principle of equality of all men .
chowdayya , a boatman , has tried to show that the untouchables existed not outside but inside the towns and villages .
it will be seen later that people belonging to higher castes were encouraged to have marital relationships with those coming from the untouchables ' group .
according to basava and others , every individual should take up some job of bis choice and perform it with all sincerity .
no individual should be a burden to society .
hence kayaka implied hard work , physical or mental .
basava served as a treasurer under bijjala and that was his kayaka .
yet , he made his followers understand him and taught them to lead such life .
he further taught his followers not to be enamoured of wealth .
he asked them to love the poor and serve them .
he had utter contempt for rich people and their vanity .
the idea that the rich break their silence as soon as the exorcist named poverty arrives is both original and beautiful .
basava was convinced that ; the rich people amassed their wealth through unfair means .
that is why their wealth was spent mostly for atonement and ceremonies and not on the needy .
money , according to basava , was the root of all evil .
o kudala sangama lord !
he declared that poverty was not a sin and that the poor man should not suffer from an inferiority complex .
he went to the houses of even the poorest and mixed with them and never hesitated to dine with them .
he wanted his people to take up a profession , work hard and be happy .
viewed from this angle , we could say without hesitation that he was a socialist in outlook .
we saw in the first chapter that women in general did not have some of the privileges and rights enjoyed by men .
they were considered socially inferior to men and all their activities were restricted to their homes .
it is difficult , sometimes impossible , for any party or advocate to forecast what will be the costs .
small claims and small litigants are at a special disadvantage .
in the first place they can afford to litigate .
they can pay high fees and retain the best advocates .
each of these capablities in the hands of one party can be a powerful weapon .
the threat of litigation becomes both credible and effective .
in such a situation , basava and his colleagues protested against the injustice done to them and declared that women should be allowed to have their rightful freedom .
basava protested against attaching any such stigma to women in general .
he said :
basava and others learnt this from dasimayya and made the emancipation of women one of the mottoes of their movement . .
siddharama , a colleague of basava , said that woman was not maya , she was god himself .
he has , in another composition , said that man and woman were like two eyes : one could not claim superiority over the other .
virashaivism did not glorify celibacy nor did it ever condemn marriage .
as a result , we find among the mystic saints of the century , at least thirty - two women who composed vachanas .
basava ' s elder sister , akkanagamma or nagalambe , has also composed vachanas .
ammavve who spun yarn , pittavve a seller of pancakes , sommavve a thresher have also composed vachanas .
there were other women who took up different occupations like visiting each house before dawn and waking up the inmates for early meditation .
some had taken up the kayaka of reciting the vacliunas in public .
another remarkable thing about the movement was the complete freedom of speech enjoyed by basava ' s . followers .
these concepts of basava were not only new but were fax ahead of his time .
each was a blow to conservatism .
the movement had brought in new ideas and the common man was made aware of his own rights .
when the masses become conscious ' of the injustice done to them , the men in powerpolitical and religiousget perturbed .
it has been shown earlier that there were attempts to question the authority of the brahmins and other high - caste people .
basava was accused of instigating the people and upsetting the social order .
there were also rumours that his life was in danger .
such things were not new to basava and he coolly ignored them - .
he said that he was prepared to face the consequences any time .
he knew that what he was doing was right and that he had the blessings and protection of lord shiva .
in spite of growing opposition from his enemies , it was this that made him strong .
he had all the weaknesses of a normal human being and he was painfully aware of them .
he was conscious that his mind was like the fruit of a fig - tree , beautiful and tempting but full of worms inside .
basava tried hard to teach his mind to love god .
it preferred , he felt , to think of sensuous pleasures rather than of god .
oh , grant me grace .
he said that the chanting of the vedas could not please god ; only bhakti could .
they say that shiva is fond of nada ,
the conflict , the despair and the ray of hope that streaked through despairall these made him cling to shiva ' s feet more and more .
basava , as we have seen , was not only a spiritual aspirant ; he was also an intellectual who was involved in social and religious affairs .
he lived in two worlds - mundane and spiritual .
it was as if basava was caught between two opposing forceseach pulling him in its own direction .
he has expressed this state of helplessness in a beautiful simile .
out of this agony of darkness came divine light .
god shiva responded to his call and made his presence felt .
basava was surprised to find god within himself .
in one of his vachanas , he has said , " do not say that i am an orphan .
i belong to the family of bana , mayura and kalidasa ; kakkayya and channayya brought me up . "
he did not , at any time , want to be reminded of his parents and their caste .
he had implicit faith in his men and had declared that he would never try to test the integrity of a person who wore a linga on his body .
i call them , o kudala sangama lord ,
as an idealist he criticised society and sometimes his own people for their shortcomings .
on another occasion , a few thieves , dressed like devotees , went to the pasture - ground and stole his cattle .
the cowherd came to basava and begged him to send men to bring the cattle back .
basava ' s reaction was quite unexpected .
he said that ' never could a devotee ' s garb contain a thief within it ' and thought that the cattle went into the right hands .
he was overcome with emotion and sang a vachana :
there was a lover in kalyana who was also a devotee of shiva .
his beloved was enamoured of the ear - rings worn by nilalochane and she begged him to get them for her .
he entered basava ' s house one night and tried to filch the ear - rings .
basava was awakened and saw before him a devotee , shivering .
she and her sister were prepared to sacrifice anything for the sake of their husband .
these episodes give us a glimpse of the kind of people who used to come to him .
these enlightened people took an active part in the movement and contributed to its success .
in these days , therefore , what is required is a radical change in the method of administration of justice .
we want courts to which people can go with ease and with as little cost as possible .
this was said about 40 years ago .
have we made any improvement ?
the bar of locus standi was liberalised as early as in 1981 .
ever since then , there has been a sizeable mould to the nature of litigation particularly in superior courts .
it is in this group of cases that the court has exhibited its competence of being a social auditor .
a section of his vachanas is named as bedagina vachanas ; bedagu literally means grace , novelty or even uncommonness .
the vachanas are paradoxical in nature : meaning one thing to a lay reader , but another to the initiated .
the language of these vachanas is comparable to the sandha - bhasha of the tp . ntric texts .
akkamahadevi is perhaps one of the greatest saints of karnataka and is comparable to mira bai of rajasthan and andal of tamil nadu .
she was born in a small town close to balligave .
she lived in the palace of kaushika for some time as ' his wife ; but she . was mentally wedded to god .
when she found that it was impossible to lead such a dual life , she divorced herself and came out of the palace .
her act of divorce was a daring one and was not probably appreciated by many people .
on one occasion basava became self - conscious that he was the donor and all others were donees .
it was machayya who criticised basava and cut him to size .
ambigara chowdayya was a man of similar character and temperament .
both machayya and chowdayya took active part in the discussions at basava ' s house .
moligeya marayya was a close associate of basava .
his unfortunately , we have not been able to identify either this royal couple or their capital mandavyapura in kashmir .
kinnarayya had a weakness for onions .
kinnarayya was pained at these words and left kalyana for a nearby village .
so basava took out a procession of onions .
the elephants and horses were decorated with onions ; men wore garlands and bracelets of onions ; the houses and streets were decorated with onion - banners .
basava himself wore a huge garland of onions .
kinnarayya was happy and was even amused at the procession .
there is an interesting story regarding this aspect of his character .
one day a few jangamas came to his place .
the person of the debtor is of course beyond seizure .
but a return to the older law will hardly recommend itself now .
in the criminal law the situation is somewhat reversed .
once judgement against an offender is given , it is much more certain to be executed .
but the concern for the individual is manifest in the procedure to judgement .
the provisions are not only considered procedural safeguards but are great constitutional rights .
they are indeed constitutional rights which have been won only after many centuries of bloodshed and in no democracy would their abandonment be seriously considered .
bat in a manner whereby you will make the least number of mistakes and not give away your wicket unnecessarily .
do n ' t ever say to yourself , " what does it matter , this is only practice ! "
bad habits formed during practice will persist and when you play in a match you will not be able to get rid of them .
he must also not try to square - cut a ball which is moving into him .
this kind of stroke may come off in practice but sometimes may prove to be risky in matches .
this spirit appears to be lacking in our cricket today .
there are two essentials of good bowlinglength and direction .
the swing and swerve come afterwards and the various kinds of spin even later .
length and direction can only be developed by regular practice .
great bowlers have spent hour after hour at the nets bowling to a length and bowling at a single wicket .
such bowlers reach great heights and achieve international fame .
bbwlers bowl not only with their fingers , their hands and their bodies but also with their heads .
a has made over a hundred runs .
b gets out within the last 10 minutes of the day ' s play .
let us take another example .
b is nearer but is a weak fielder .
the advantages of team - work and discipline are better understood in indian cricket now than in my time .
during my playing days we had many outstanding cricketers but they played as individuals , rarely as a team .
today our side is playing as a team and that is why our performance is much better .
he must have an extremely sure pair of hands and he must be able to stop most of the balls that come to him .
if a wicket - keeper is continuously dropping the ball , he is likely to drop the ball when a catch comes along .
a captain should never ask a player to do anything which he would not be prepared to do himself .
he may . take guidance from the senior cricketers in the team but he must make his own decisions .
the captain must regard himself as one of the cricketers and not apart from them .
he must not be reluctant to give credit to the members of his team .
but perjury has always been a not infrequent crime .
it should certainly be no less powerful a restraint to fear the punishments of this world than to fear the torments of the next .
authority has maintained itself somehow despite the decay of religious institutions .
there is again the pernicious influence of the modern city .
to it is attributed the congestion of the courts which is supposed to be the very basis of the modern maladministration of justice .
but mere size hardly account for the evils of metropolitan justice .
as a matter of fact the city has been the originator of most of the improvements of procedure in the history of legal systems .
if there are more litigants in the city , it has the necessary wealth to secure additional judges and good lawyers .
in the past two years young talent has made its mark and if given a fair opportunity will more than prove itself .
today indian umpires are as good as any in the world .
but they are not rated high by other countries .
they do make mistakes , but which umpire in the world does not ?
gone are the days when a batsman accepted the umpire ' s decision as final and binding .
the largest ground in the world is at melbourne in australia where they can accommodate 1,20,000 spectators .
the highest aggregate attendance for a complete test match was 3.50,534 on the same ground when australia played england in 1936 - 37 .
the amenities here for the cricketers , the commentators , the press and the spectators are more up - to - date .
this is a great help to the cricketer .
in the evening within five minutes of the end of play he can be in his room for tea and a chat with friends .
once a young english batsman had been batting for a long time without scoring a run .
suddenly he hit the ball on the off - side and went in for a very quick single .
indian crowds are very distracting because they make a noise even when the ball is in play .
english crowds , on the other hand , are extremely polite , very quiet and very well - behaved .
even when things go wrong or there is extremely dull cricket their method of protest is only slow hand - clapping nothing more .
very rarely is a game disturbed by the crowd and , believe me , it is a pleasure to play on english grounds .
the lessons learnt on the cricket field are always useful on the wider field of life .
these words are the greatest tribute ever paid to the game .
cricket is not merely a game of patience , ability , skill and technique .
these a player may have and yet may not reach the top .
temperament too is essential in order to succeed .
a player who is nervous will not make much headway .
now to illustrate an aspect of temperament .
do n ' t worry about it , vijay , because nervous tension brings out the best in a cricketer ' s game . "
in 1933 - 34 , i got my first chance to play in test cricket in india .
the m . c . c . team under douglas jardine was in our country to play three test matches .
i had carefully put down ' m . c . c . touring team1933 - 34 ' on one of the pages .
under this heading i took the autographs of all the 16 players who visited india .
two months later i had an occasion to approach gandhiji for his autograph which my sister was very keen to have .
there were quite a few people present when i made my request .
it has given me firm friendships , opportunities to travel abroad and good health and a strong constitution .
by teaching me to make up for the failures of others in a game , it has taught me to help those who are less fortunate than i am .
the right time for braces
what is " orthodontics , " and why do people get braces ?
the reason for all this is that in many of the states , administration of justice has a low priority .
when finances are needed for the purpose of improving the judicial system at the lower levels , there is reluctance to make such finances available .
impartiality of judges and their integrity there has always been insistence upon the superior integrity of judicial administration .
the administration of justice is considered not only as a function of the state but as something of a mystery .
this is apparent from many familiar practices and sentiments .
at least high courts of justice are everywhere required to be architecturally magnificent .
nothing more can undermine the certainty of justice than lack of impartiality .
thus the integrity of the administration of justice has been elevated as an ideal .
moreover the insistence has been upon a superior degree of integrity as compared with other branches of administration .
judicial administration has been surrounded with special safeguards .
the slighest hint of irregularity or impropriety in the courts is a cause for great anxiety and alarm .
to speak of " the independence , impartiality and integrity of the judges and administration of justice has become almost a fetish " ' .
the modern tendency is that the right to criticize judges be one of the safeguards to ensure very high standards of performance .
it is indeed remarkable that every living organism passes on specific characters from generation to generation .
in each generation it ensures growth , development and reproduction to be followed by aging and death .
the nitrogenous bases are of four types ? adenine , guanine , cytosine and thymine .
each unit of the dna molecule is a nucleotide made up of its three basic components ? the base - sugar - phosphate .
dna generally exists as a double stranded helical structure ( fig . 3 ) .
the two strands are held together by weak bonds between the bases .
it is the base sequences which are the actual messages for the growth and development of the organism .
each organism is unique in itself in the sense that the sequence of bases found in dna is specific for each species .
it is estimated that the bacterium e . coli has about 3,000 proteins in it .
a human being has about 100,000 different proteins in his body .
one of the outstanding properties of a living being is to reproduce in a faithful manner .
let us see how the primitive unicellular organisms achieved their replication .
the most ancient , smallest and simplest living organisms are the microscopic , unicellular beings called bacteria .
bacteria are found everywhere where life can be supported .
bacteria normally reproduce by the asexual method described as binary fission .
during this process , the genetic material ( dna ) first duplicates itself .
subsequently , the cell itself expands and divides into two with the formation of a new cell wall in the middle .
thus the whole cell is ultimately divided into two daughter cells with each of them having identical copies of the genetic material .
in a bacterium , this division takes just about twenty to thirty minutes under ideal conditions .
there are some bacteria like e . coli which exhibit a form of sexual reproduction described as ijacterial conjugation ' .
sometimes the plasmid contains a specific gene called the fertility or f gene .
such a bacterium assumes the role of a donor or male .
this process of transfer of plasmid at times along with a small part of the chromosome is known as conjugation .
following this , the recipient bacterium undergoes division and gives rise to progenies which would inherit some of the properties of the donor .
moreover , after donating its genetic material to the recipient bacterium , the donor bacterium has no further role to play !
another deviation from normal asexual reproduction is the formation of spores in bacteria .
this is to protect the genetic material of the cell from adverse conditions of environment .
on the other hand , in females , this pair is homologous .
it contains two x chromosomes .
all the cells in human beings , except the sex cells ? sperm and egg ? are diploid .
the haploid sex cells or gametes are formed by a type of cell division called meiosis .
meiosis achieves two aims .
one , it halves the chromosomal number of the diploid cells to form the haploid gamete .
this is nature ' s idea to maintain the chromosome number of the species .
when the sex cells fuse , the zygote thus formed will have exactly the same number of chromosomes as the parent .
it is clear that nature has ' opted ' for elimination of the individual organism once the duty of reproduction is fulfilled .
quite obviously , the only natural purpose of any living being is to survive and this survival is aimed only at the propagation of species .
granting that the only purpose of a species is to propagate , why opt for the elimination of members during post - replication period ?
what are the advantages conferred upon species because of death ?
the answers to these questions are not too difficult to guess .
there will be dreadful competition for food , shelter and other resources that are required for living .
nature has made a choice for sexual reproduction to introduce tremendous variety in the genetic make - up .
apart from the visible changes of greying hair and wrinkling skin there are other changes that occur within the body at the tissue and cellular level .
there is an overall physiological deterioration in all vital functions like respiration , cardiac function , kidney function , muscular function , etc .
the zygote divides a number of times to form a large number of cells .
then at some point these cells differentiate into different organs and finally the body is formed as we see when a child is born .
these changes are declared as growth , development and maturation and there is a positive meaning attached to the whole gamut of changes .
all tissues , and even skin , become laden with water as a consequence of aging .
the loss of voluntary muscle tissues is evidently due to disuse of muscles and setting in of atrophy rather than loss of muscle fibres .
changes that take place within the body at the organ , cell and molecular level have other consequences .
the thymus gland which is responsible for protecting the body against invading foreign organisms weighs about 200 - 250 grammes at birth .
after maturity this organ begins to shrink and by the sixtieth year is reduced to a small size of about 3 to 5 grammes .
this is one of the reasons why older people fall sick more often .
once the defence mechanisms are weak , the person becomes susceptible to all kinds of infections .
the body ' s structure depends on two kinds of fibrous protein molecules ? collagen and elastin .
collagen constitutes almost one - third of the body protein and is found in skin , bone and tendons .
the rate of collagen synthesis is high in youth and declines through rest of the life .
insoluble collagen increases with age leading to rigidity and general body stiffness .
there is increase in incidence of anaemia in old age due to depletion of blood - forming stem cells .
it may be surprising that the height of an individual begins to decrease from the age of thirty .
by the time one is sixty , as much as three - fourths of an inch in height is lost .
the muscles also begin to lose their weight because of the degeneration of the muscle cells and which are not replaced .
slowly the space of these cells is taken by fat .
according to one estimate more than half the muscle mass is lost by the time one is seventy .
the most outstanding psychological features of aging are the impairment of short - term memory and the lengthening of response time .
the lens of the eye also begins to harden .
more than 50 per cent of the population suffer from cataract by the time they attain the age of sixty .
the senses of smell and taste too decline particularly during the sixth and seventh decades .
the need for long sleep diminishes .
they tend to sleep for shorter durations and the quality of sleep is light rather than a deep one .
it is believed that these changes are due to both - physiological and psychological reasons .
effect of aging on body systems aging brings with it a series of ailments .
quite naturally the organ ' s poor functioning leads to several complications .
the immunological system has been implicated in the body ' s defences against the much dreaded disease called cancer that normally afflicts older generations .
studies reveal that aged persons have greater chances of suffering from this disease .
cancer is a condition of uncontrolled multiplication of a population of cells in the body .
extensive research is going on all over the world to find out why normal cells turn cancerous .
it is believed that both cancer and aging are caused by alterations in the dna molecule , the genetic material .
it is not , however , clear which of the alterations lead to cancer and which of them to the death of the cell .
there is a general slowing of responses in the elderly ; reflexes become more sluggish and the speed of conduction of impulses in the nerves gets slightly slowed down .
similarly , there are a number of nervous disorders more commonly making their appearance in persons beyond fifty or sixty years of age .
these include parkinson ' s disease ( plate i ) , alzheimer ' s disease , senile dementia ( plate iii ) and stroke .
parkinson ' s disease is featured by uncontrolled contractions of skeletal muscle , causing tremors .
the person experiences difficulty in initiating movement and then moves slowly while leaning slightly forward .
the disease is a chronic and progressive one and for some yet unknown reasons more common in men than women .
this disease is caused by the degeneration of an area called basal ganglia in the brain .
the most effective treatment for this condition is the administration of a compound called l - dopa .
this court will readily respond even to a letter addressed by such individual action pro bono publico .
the courts have taken a goal - oriented approach in the interest of justice .
they do not insist on procedural technicalities and in a number of cases even vakalatnamas and affidavits have not been called for by them .
cases on behalf of undertrials have been entertained on the basis of newspaper reports or letters .
among the earliest symptoms of alzheimer ' s disease are impairment of recent memory , spatial disorientation and a lessening of spontaneous emotional responses .
gradually hearing functions deteriorate and the ability to read , write and calculate are lost .
the patients become very confused and cannot even recognise members of their family .
the patient may in the final stages experience seizures and cannot speak even .
all these symptoms are collectively referred to as dementia ( mental deterioration ) .
senile dementia , as the name itself indicates , is the deterioration of mental functions in old age .
cardiovascular accident or stroke is a common aging dysfunction .
a stroke occurs when a blood vessel to the brain gets obstructed or ruptured .
either way high levels of glucose and sometimes even that of insulin are found in blood .
since glucose is not available , the cells end up using fat and proteins for energy and this leads to a variety of complications .
although one form of diabetes is found occasionally in young people ( the juvenile type of diabetes ) , more often this disease is associated with advancing age .
though diminishing sexual activity does occur in both males and females there is no uniform or hard and fast rule ; it varies with individuals .
skeletal system due to aging , the bones lose calcium and minerals and are more prone to break even with minor falls .
all kinds of back pain are a primary symptom of the disease which can be treated with increased intake of calcium and anabolic hormones .
the ability of joints decreases with age and the incidence of arthritis increases .
scientists have been tinkering with the human body , down to its molecular level to unravel the mysteries of this ticking .
" he has grown old so rapidly in the last few months ! "
we often hear these comments from people which are indications that the alarm clock has been triggered .
just what triggers the alarm clock or the unwinding of the spring ?
in a quest to find an answer to precisely this question , scientists have been analysing the changes that take place within the body .
a number of scientists have proposed theories or the possible reasons for aging .
one is those cells of the body that divide and produce new cells as long as the person is alive .
similar comparative scales can be made between any other two species .
this means that the three main phases of life are there in every species - r - development , reproduction and senescence .
the only difference is in the length of each phase .
for instance a rat after birth thrives on its mother ' s milk for about three weeks .
from then onwards it can eat outside food independently to become an adult by three to six months of age .
the reproductive period spans for about six months at which point aging symptoms begin to appear .
a human baby thrives on mother ' s milk for about six months and quite often this continues upto one - and - a - half to two years .
reproductive phase spans for another twenty years , then signs of aging appear .
the point to be noted here is that the milestones of life are the same in all species .
however , the time taken to cross each milestone varies and apparently this is what determines the life span .
what determines the length of the developmental period and of the reproductive period ?
obviously during evolution these characteristics are gained and therefore , the determinants are genetic in nature , meaning , the life span is programmed in the genes .
it was once believed that cells grown in laboratory cultures are essentially immortal once the nutrient supply is ensured .
when they reach this stage , they are said to have reached confluence .
this process constitutes a passage .
if brought back to room temperature and cultured , they divided another thirty times and no more !
not only that , when the cells were taken from older individuals , they divided fewer times and then stopped .
this meant that the number of doublings a cell can go through is dependent upon the age of the donor .
these experiments have clearly shown that the information regarding the number of divisions a given cell can go through is already written in that cell .
thus , as already mentioned at some point , some of these theories converge to a genetic basis .
recall the analogy of an alarm clock that begins to buzz at a predetermined time .
here the alarm clock is like a gene ( s ) which becomes active at a predetermined time in the life span .
this theory suggests that the human life span is an inherited trait .
survey studies also show that in general the offsprings of long - lived parents have a longer life span .
in these regions , people are known to live upto 120 years !
however , it must also be admitted that the manner in which the genefic signals are actually transformed into visible aging is far from understood .
gene regulation theory : this theory was proposed by an indian scientist , prof . m . s . kanungo of benares hindu university almost twenty years ago .
there is a sequentialactivation and repression of genes through the three phases of life ? development , reproduction and senescence .
in simple terms , some of the genes which are active during development may activate some genes which would induce the reproductive phase of life .
once again some of the genes which are active in reproductive phase would induce some other genes which are responsible for the onset of senescence .
the validity of this theory lies in the identification of the precise gene products of one phase which triggers the next phase .
scientists are at it . /
all information regarding structure and function of an organism is stored in the genetic blueprint ? the dna .
these functions are mediated through proteins .
proteins are long chains of various combinations of the twenty different amino acids .
however , why this happens is not clear by any of these experiments .
it is also possible that this defect could be an effect rather than cause of aging .
therefore the basic question remains unanswered .
these observations were extended to humans by other scientists , later .
we have to take them to a mechanic and get them repaired .
the dna damage and repair theory proposes that the ability to repair the damaged dna decreases with age in different living systems .
indeed extensive research has been carried out to check these important points .
in general there is an agreement amongst research workers that more damaged / altered dna is found in older animals .
the symptoms vary from one syndrome to the other .
down ' s syndrome , described by a scientist by the name down , in 1866 , is a genetic disorder .
one out of every 660 children born is found to inherit this defect .
hence it is one of the best studied and also shows the maximum number of features noticed in normal aging of humans .
this defect is due to the presence of chromo - some - 21 in triplet .
normally we have only one pair of chromosome - 21 , but in these patients , a third one is also present .
this condition is described as trisomy of chromosome - 21 .
many such cases were found in the following years .
the most striking feature in this genetic disorder is severe growth retardation that can be noticed as early as at six to twelve months of age .
in these subjects sexual maturation is never reached although in some cases intelligence is found to be normal .
death is usually caused by cardiovascular disease .
werner ' s syndrome is similar to progeria in many ways except that the pace at which aging symptoms are developed is much less .
lack of growth , very little adipose tissue , aged appearance , lack of good intelligence are some of the features ( plate ii ) .
firstly , their longevities are still within the range of maximum life span of human beings .
secondly , it is difficult to imagine how such mutation could take place only in certain regions of the globe and not in other parts .
as a simple example we may consider greying of hair as , one of the symptoms of aging .
we may also suppose that a particular gene is involved in keeping the hair dark .
what happens when a number of genes concerned with the programme of aging ' are inherited in an altered form ?
some of the resulting hybrid cells have gained the dna - repair proficient character and behave like normal cells .
this is like two persons having plates of meals before them .
one of them has all the items except rice , the other has all the items except curds .
the first one donates some curds to the second while the second donates some rice to the first .
both , now , have a complete meal !
some human dna - repair genes have been identified and found to be quite similar to those already characterised in lower organisms like bacteria .
scientists in the netherlands have used the technique of micro - injection for this purpose .
somewhere there is a subtle directional change between immortality , aging and cancer .
however , the aim of the aging research is not to achieve immortality ? at least it is not one of the immediate primary concerns .
then people can ' age ' in a . healthy and happy manner .
of course , death will finally take over , but it need not necessarily be preceded by a prolonged illness and debilitative life .
life has a beginning , middle and an end .
why should the end be a miserable and dreaded one always ?
because of the improvement in general medical care and reduction in infant mortality , there is notable increase in the longevity of populations all over the world .
the improvements in the developed world such as the usa and the countries of europe are more spectacular than in a developing country like india .
still , the average life span of an indian has gone upto fifty - nine years from around thirty - five years as evident forty years ago .
this means that there are more and more older people in the population .
in 1980 about 11.2 per cent of the total population of united states was over sixty - five years old .
it is projected that by the year 2000 this figure will rise to thirty - five million and by the year 2030 to sixty - five million .
today about fifty million people are above sixty years of age in india and this makes about 6 per cent of the population .
the public interest litigation is not a normal litigation with adversaries pitted against one another .
in some cases the high courts have the jurisdiction to deal with matters more effectively as courts of first instance than the supreme court .
however a note of caution has to be sounded here , which is best expressed by justice v . khalid of the supreme court :
it is , therefore , necessary to lay down clear guidelines and to outline the correct parameters for entertainment of such petitions .
these behaviour patterns may be the result of social institutions and experiences rather than an intrinsic phenomenon of aging .
two other factors that are helpful in this respect are good health and an adequate income .
therefore the state has to plan carefully in order to use the ' youth ' and ' old ' as synergistic forces .
it is also essential that a new social and cultural fabric be inducted into the societies .
luckily in india this would be an easy task because of its cultural heritage .
there is mounting experimental evidence to show that the process of aging sets in at some point of the reproductive phase .
these deteriorative changes are seen at all levels including the visible .
since the basic command affecting these changes lies at the level of genes , it is important how well the integrity of genetic apparatus is maintained .
there are individual differences in this capacity ? a trait which is also inherited .
nevertheless , the maximum life span of a given rapid strides in biological research promise that genetic intervention of the aging process is a possibility .
what could perhaps be achieved in the years to come is to improve the longevity to the point of a maximum life span .
it is often said that indian society is basically conservative and hence admits of no grave changes in its sociological set - up .
the second source of information is the vachanas or short compositions in poetic prose of basava himself and of his contemporaries .
then , there are inscriptions of his times .
this kannada version is one of the most popular works in mysore state and was read and studied with deep devotion .
certain facts pertaining to the life of basava which are recorded in earlier texts are contradictory .
and they have given rise to some serious controversies .
under the act , a district village panchayat mandal was constituted in every district for the supervision and control of village panchayats .
these mandals were , however , abolished in 1962 .
village panchayats set up under these new enactments were substantially different from those that had existed in the british period .
the administrative report , the proposed development programme , audit report , compliance of audit objections and other such matters were also required to be placed before this meeting .
group nyaya panchayats were established , but later they were abolished .
the obligatory duties of the panchayats were mainly of a civil nature , that is , making provisions for sanitation , street lights and drinking water .
she begged god nandi for a son and promised that she would name her son after him .
she was blessed with &amp; son whom the parents named basava ( sanskrit vrishabha ) .
the child was as pretty as ' the rays of the moon ' arid was a ' generous donor of sweet smiles ' to all those who fondled him .
it was a house where vedic hymns where recited day in and day out and the young boy basava knew by heart innumerable vedic verses .
he could recite them with proper intonation .
his father wanted him to walk the traditional brahmin path and become a scholar and a leader of the brahmin community .
basava was a very sensitive and intelligent child .
with the consolidation of british rule in india , the uniformity of law and procedure were established and common civil and criminal codes were introduced .
to administer their laws , the rulers introduced their own system of laws , lawyers and courts .
a person who can practice as advocate in the courts of law is governed by the provisions of advocates act 1961 .
he ' could not tolerate cunning .
he would be harsh towards those who ill - treated others .
he would never miss a prasanga , a religious discourse , where tales of devotees were narrated .
two stories made a deep impression on him .
one was that of kannappa , a saint of tamil nadu .
kannappa was a hunter who knew nothing about god and religion .
hunting was his profession and he was too ignorant to think of killing as a sin .
one day he went hunting to a forest and chased a deer .
he got lost in the forest and accidentally came to a lonely temple of shiva .
he asked the image of shiva the whereabouts of the deer and it answered him and helped him get it .
kannappa was impressed and he told shiva that he would live there and give him company .
he killed animals and offered meat to god .
there was a brahmin priest who visited the temple only during daytime and offered worship according to agamic prescriptions .
he wanted to show to the world the genuineness of kannappa ' s devotion and began to shed blood from his eyes .
on seeing this , whereas the brahmin priest ran away in fear , kannappa wholeheartedly gave both his eyes to god .
god always values inner purity and not outward appearance .
the child used to be initiated intp reading and writing at the age of five .
basava was now a boy of eight years .
madiraja , like any loving father , made all arrangements for performing the initiation ceremony .
the father could not believe this for a moment .
he pleaded that he was born a brahmin and that itself was a great thing .
basava flatly refused to listen to his father ' s advice and curtly remarked that brahminism and bhakti were things opposed to each other .
a brahmin could never become a god ' s son and a god ' s favourite should give up brahminism to earn for himself god ' s grace .
there must have been a great uproar in the conservative sections and basava must have faced all the abuses and threats with courage for a short period .
kudalasangama is a small village in bijapur district .
kudalasangama is a very beautiful place where the tiver malaprabha joins the krishna .
near the conflu - mce is a temple , and the god there is called sangamesh - wara .
the place was also called ' kappadisangama ' .
it was a holy place often visited by shaiva ascetics and the temple was a famous centre of pilgrimage during that period .
basava chose to come to kudalasangama not because there were people to whom he could go , but because there was god kudalasangama or sangameshwarathe deity he secretly adored .
as he came into the temple , his psnt - up emotions burst forth into words : he called god his father , his mother , and his everything .
but even here his religion is not clearly named .
a section of the virashaivas believes that virashaivism was established and propagated by pancha - acharyas or the five prophets .
there is a good deal of mixing - up of various shaiva groups since basava .
the present - day virashaivas may be said to fall roughly into two groups : the followers of revanasiddha and the followers of basava .
ideologically there are not very many differences between the two .
this also seems to suggest that he did not start a new religion , but revolutionised old shaivism and gave it a new form .
the accountants had made an arithmetical error which would have cost the treasurer five millions .
on enquiry he was surprised to find that basava was his distant relative and requested him to stay with him .
it may be that things did not happen in the same way as narrated above .
but the narration does tell broadly how basava was able to get a job under bijjala .
to us , many of these events appear to have happened by sheer coincidence ; but basava ascribed it all to god ' s grace .
a ganaka ( or ganitavit ) was an important official in the state administration .
two important qualities were expected of a ganaka : intelligence and sincerity .
to them , the temple represented conservatism and institutionalism .
they obviously thought that only the rich could build a temple and the poor never .
to them , worshipping in a temple perhaps suggested that god was one who lived away from them .
and basava , we may recall here , had for the first time enlightened them on the true nature of worship .
it is called ishta linga ( ' dear linga ' ) as opposed to sthavara linga ( . ' the fixed linga ' ) of the temple .
this linga is taken out twice a day , kept in the palm and worshipped .
this practice implies two things : one , the individual soul is pashu ( lit . , cattle ) and that god is pashupati , the master .
the cattle should always be under the protection of their master .
two , the human soul is god himself and it is by slow and steady practice that the soul can rise up and reach god and become god himself .
the virashaiva religion expects its followers to respect the guru , linga and jangama , and prescribes that due regard should be shown to each .
guru is the teacher who initiates a person into virashaivism and gives the linga .
the initiate is asked to wear the linga always on his body .
this explanation may look like a digression , but it is essential for an understanding of the religious life of basava .
basava ' s fame as a man of purity , modesty and great devotion had spread far and wide .
he was well paid and had only a small family to maintain .
his house was a veritable feeding house , a satra .
in the beginning things went ' on well between basava and his employer .
his social movement gained momentum and became very popular .
the converts were taught uo be conscious of their individuality and not to feel inferior to others .
machayya refused to wash the clothes of the upper - class people .
the movement posed a great threat to - other religions .
it is possible that bijjala took these charges seriously and put basava to the test on various occasions .
bijjala was a follower of traditional shaivism .
if we are to believe the stories , basava was dismissed once and assumed his duties only after getting an apology from bijjala .
basava had both official duties and social obligations to perform .
they were asked to give them up and worship lord shiva .
but there were people who neither gave up their traditions nor accepted virashaivism on trust .
basava and his colleagues were faced with many such problems .
basava ' s religion forbade the use of meat , liquor and hemp .
it was very difficult for many converts to give up their traditional food habits .
and so they broke his commands in secret .
channabasava , the nephew of basava , strongly condemned such hypocrisy .
he firmly declared that ' liquor , meat , hemp and friendship with a bhavi are to be given up .
the new entrant was advised to treat every other virashaiva as his equal .
with infinite patience , they had to be persuaded to conform to the new teaching .
this was by no means an easy task .
these argued that they made no distinctions in matters of co - dining , etc .
but when matters like marriage came up , they would discriminate .
basava and others had named their street as ' the street of the greater maaheshwaras ' . , and used to visit the street often .
they went in a group to king bijjala and complained that his treasurer basava had entered the house of a harijan in defiance of the varnashrama dharma .
they said that not only was basava getting polluted , but he was polluting the royal court also .
basava came to the king and was severely reprimanded for having entered the house of an untouchable .
so long as there is desire to retain these essential features of the present system the high cost of litigation flows as a direct consequence .
the administration of justice will not be effective and real , if access to justice is so expensive as it has become today .
the late mr m c setalvad , the first attorney general of india , in his address to the bar association of india said :
we are now a democratic country and we are a much more populous country .
" seeing god was great happiness and union with him was great ecstasy , " he exclaimed .
in the beginning of . his sadhane , basava considered god his master and himself god ' s servant .
he also viewed god as his ' husband ' and himself as god ' s ' beloved ' .
basava composed some of his finest vachanas when he walked the path of ' sweet passion ' ( madhura - bhava ) , mentioned above .
he lived the life of a faithful ' wife ' and was able to win his ' husband ' s ' love .
there are reasons to believe that he came from sava - laksha , an area probably south of the himalayan range .
a similar family of a poor but happy couple was that of aydakki marayya and his wife lakkarama .
again lakkamma chided her husband for growing too greedy and sent the extra grains back saying ' greediness was for kings and not for devotees ' .
kinnari bommayya was another devotee whose profession was lute - playing .
when basava ' s wives went to wake him up , they found to their horror that he was dead .
hearing their grief - stricken cries , there came running some close associates of basava .
with intuitive understanding , they asked whether any jangamas had come when basava was asleep .
he was called jangama - prani ' a man whose life - bream had its source not in his own body but in that of the jangamas ' .
stories like the above were perhaps later creations to show the intense love basava had for his men .
his compositions give us a complete and systematic exposition of the shatstha / a philosophy .
it has been said earlier that the followers of basava enjoyed perfect freedom of speech .
there used to be regular gatherings at his residence .
fear and envy spurred them to make fresh attempts at bringing discredit to basava .
these people were soon joined by the court officials who had fallen out with basava on matters religious and political .
there is no wonder if such a man was not keen on bringing about a change in the social set - up .
again , being a sovereign ruler of his country , he did not want one of his subordinates to become a leader of the masses .
they also prescribe that the king should see that there is no varna - sankara or mixing of castes through marriage .
basava ' s enemies pleaded before bijjaia that basava ' s actions led to varna - sankara and that it was taking place under his very nose .
they impressed on his mind that he , as a king , had failed in his duties .
besides , he did not want his own religion to suffer at the hands of virashaivism .
if there were reasons for him to like basava and his idealism , there were stronger reasons to dislike him and his idealism .
he fully knew that the people were obedient to bijjala not out of love or respect , but out of fear .
it was observed earlier that bijjala wanted to test the integrity of basava , on many occasions he tried to make fun of basava and fool him .
ever so many stories are narrated by later virashaiva writers of how bijjala tried to fool basava , but was himself fooled .
in spite of it , basava tolerated all the undeserved disgrace that was heaped on him .
but the virashaiva society was boiling with rage and was waiting for an opportunity to avenge the humiliation suffered by its leader .
to them , it was not a question of clash between individuals : it was a clash between ' ideas .
they felt that bijjala was an impediment in the progress of their religion and movement .
with this background in mind , let us examine the events which occurred during the last days of basava .
in kalyana , there was an official by name jagadeva .
fascinated by basava ' s teachings , he had adopted his religion .
even before they came to his house , he invited a few brahmins and offered them food .
jagadeva repented his action and took an oath that he would atone for evil act by killing an enemy of virashaivism .
in the same city of , kalyana lived two devotees of shiva called allayya and madhuvayya .
by birth allayya was an untouchable and madhuvayya a brahmin ; both were friends and followed the teachings of basava .
madhuvayya wanted to give his daughter in marriage to allayya ' s son .
they were much perturbed and complained to bijjala about the proposed marriage .
they refused to obey him and said that they would go ahead with the marriage come what may .
this raised a storm of protest among the virashaivas .
so long as bijjala lived , they said to themselves , neither they nor their religion would be safe .
when he was reminded of his oath , he gladly agreed to put an end to bijjala ' s life .
she said that as long as the oath he had taken remained unfulfilled , he would be treated like a dog .
molle and bomma , two of basava ' s followers , joined him .
his mind was perturbed and he wanted peace .
these gave him some solace no doubt .
but he began to feel that his mission was fulfilled and it was up to his colleagues to continue the struggle .
he knew that his end was near and he wanted it .
basava sent one of his colleagues , appanna , to go and bring her to kudalasangama .
basava seems to have survived bijjala for a very short period of time .
he breathed his last in about 1167 - 68 a . d . at the confluence of rivers .
' like a wave in the ocean and like a breeze in the air ' he became one with the infinite .
as machayya put it , be ' was covered with the light and became void ' .
but now the lamp was broken and the oil spilt , but the light had become one with the divine light .
he did not rule for long and his four brothers came to the throne in quick succession .
thaila iii , whom bijjala had ousted , had a son named someshwara iv and he was still living .
thus the short - lived kalachurya empire came to an end .
in 1190 a . d . , the chalukyan country was occupied by the yadavas of devagiri in the north and by the hoysalas of dnrasamudra in the south .
basava had left behind him a band of dedicated workers , and more than that , great ideas .
workers like channabasava and madivala machayya carried on the work of basava .
basava had brought about a thorough change in the social outlook itself and had sown seeds of revolution in the minds of the people .
the revolution did bear fruit immediately .
for example , harihara and raghavanka , the revolutionary poets of the thirteenth century , derived their inspiration from basava and others .
they were the products of the revolution .
but it was propagated more as an organised religion than as a social movement .
the death of bijjala has been a matter of controversy .
some people say that bijjala was murdered in spite of basava ' s pleadings .
this kind of extreme religious fanaticism or fervour was accepted in principle , though rarely put into practice .
for some time , kalyana ceased to be the centre of religious activities .
this indirectly helped the propagation of religion .
the leaders who were centred in kalyana went out and settled in different parts of the land .
with them travelled new ideas and new thoughts .
basava is rrmembered not only as a social and religious reformer , but also as a man of letters .
he is perhaps the greatest writer of vachanas in kannada .
he was certainly not the first to compose vachanas .
the recorded history of kannada literature begins from the ninth century .
during the tenth century , great poets like parnpa and ranna composed their long narratives in a style called champu .
since these poets employed the spoken language of the day , they were naturally intelligible to most of their contemporaries .
however , with the passage of time , language underwent a change towards the beginning / of the eleventh century .
as a result , the champu poems composed during the eleventh and twelfth centuries were intelligible only to the pundits
literature became one way of exhibiting one ' s scholarship . the language became pedantic and more and more sanskrltised .
basava ' s movement was for the common man and not for the scholar and the sophisticated .
the leaders of the movement wanted to teach and guide the masses .
it was but natural for them to employ in their writings the language of the masses .
the words he employs are simple , but full of overtones and undertones .
the following vachana looks simple and communicates an idea . but there is a deeper meaning suggested :
the husband takes the grace from washing of the feet ;
the wife takes meat and wine !
incidentally , the suggested meaningthe suggestion may be unintentionalis that the husband and the wife are like the outer and the inner faces of a container .
women , in general , are more conservative and that is also suggested here .
a few of the mystics of this fifteenth century composed vachanas .
the total number of vachanas composed by basava and others which are edited and printed now may exceed twelve thousand .
more and more vachanas are discovered each year with the discovery of new manuscripts .
we may not be able to appreciate all that he said and practised .
the present - day virashaiva society may not be the society of his dreams .
but then , which religion or society has even approximated to the dreams of its prophets ?
still a careful study of basava shows the relevance of his teachings for us even today .
this tribute is from a great social reformer of india of the modern times .
cricket has been played in india since 1721 .
it is a commonwealth game and was introduced by the british in all the territories which they ruled over .
these were matches between the europeans and the parsees and were played every year in poona and bombay .
they aroused a great deal of interest in the game .
gradually the other communities also became interested in cricket and in 1907 a third team entered the arenathe hindus .
when it became the triangular tournament poona ceased to be a venue and the matches were played in bombay which now became the home of indian cricket .
the only exceptions were the quadrangulars of 1922 and 1926 which were played in poona .
if there is a series of five test matches the remaining two are played at delhi and kanpur .
although cricket is foreign to us , it has now practically become our national game .
everyone knows that a match is played between two sides of 11 cricketers each .
the most essential tools in cricket are the bat and the ball .
in other words , the bat should feel like a part of his body when he plays .
he may use a heavy or a light bat and also a long or a short handle as his game requires .
the player must oil and season the bat before he uses it in a match .
the term seasoning means getting all parts of the bat hit by the ball several times .
usually a new ball is used after 75 overs in first - class cricket .
then we have leg - guards for the batsman to protect him from being hit on the legs .
we also have gloves , an abdomen - guard and some batsmen also use thigh - pads .
both the abdomen - guard and the thigh - pads are worn under the trousers .
the normal cricket uniform is a white shirt , white trousers , thick white woollen socks and white cricket boots not shoes .
very long hair should be avoided .
formerly umpires were allowed to wear any kind of dress provided they put on a long white coat on top .
as an illustration we may take what happened at the brabourne stadium in 1964 - 65 when australia paid us a visit .
the aim in batting , after all , is to meet the ball with as straight a bat as possible .
the margin of error in batting is so narrow that one little mistake can prove to be the end of your innings .
cricket is wrongly called a game of chance .
it is a game of great skill , hard and continuous practice , total concentration and big - match temperament .
as he left the umpire declared him out .
such impressive examples of sportsmanship may be rare but they are worth emulating .
if an independant judiciary is regarded as the heart of a republic , then the indian republic is at present suffering from serious heart ailment .
it is a trite saying that justice delayed is justice denied .
they have to pass through in our own courts have to wait patiently for years and years to get justice .
i , for me , do not think that a large increase in the number of judges is desirable .
when is the right time for braces ?
patients with orthodontic problems can benefit from treatment at nearly any age .
what kind of braces will i have to wear ?
all use wires to move the teeth to the desired position .
how long will i have to wear braces ?
as a final outcome , death ensues .
such is the way of nature .
nature seems to act as an eliminator , but only after ensuring that the species has propagated itself .
it is important to go back to the question as to when does the actual process of aging start in one ' s life .
this ' life ' began through an interaction between certain chemical substances called nucleic acids and proteins .
the products of such spontaneous discharges are thought to be amino acids , formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide .
in fact , scientists have shown the above transformations in the laboratory by itself simulating the prebiotic ( before life began ) conditions .
similarly ribose , a five - carbon sugar present in one of the nucleic acids , can be synthesised from formaldehyde .
it is supposed that some minerals like zinc and lead might have once served as catalysts for polymerisation of nucleotides into nucleic acids .
synthesis of polynucleotides , even before ' life ' began , may have been influenced by the interaction of nucleotides with peptides .
thus , nucleic acids and proteins , the prime molecules of ' life ' , seem to have formed under prebiotic conditions .
once the nucleic acids and proteins were formed , these molecules could have aided each other to form more of these molecules .
it is still a matter of speculation as to how inanimate molecules like nucleic acids and proteins become ' live ' and how ' life ' originated .
the functional unit of the living organism is a cell with discrete chemical composition .
not only a number of diverse chemical substances are found in cells , but they exist in a highly organised manner .
every part and every chemical found in a living organism has a specific purpose and function .
the chemical composition of a living organism is quite different from that of the environment in which it lives .
the most extraordinary feature of living organisms is their ability to reproduce themselves with perfect accuracy .
not once , but countless number of times .
this includes , for example , prisoners under trial or workers in stone quarries or inmates of care centres or homes , pavements dwellers , etc .
in the words of justice p n bhagwati of the supreme court :
cardiovascular system diseases of the heart account for over 50 per cent of deaths after the age of sixty - five .
even in the absence of detectable diseases , the heart undergoes deleterious changes with advancing age .
structural changes include a gradual loss of muscle fibres accompanied with infiltration of fat and , connective tissue .
the heart also shows a gradual reduction in performance with increase in age .
the amount of the blood pumped by the heart diminishes by about 50 per cent between twenty and ninety years of age .
under resting conditions , the heart rate does not change significantly with age .
arteriosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , increases markedly in incidence with age .
it is characterised by the deposition of fatty and other substances on the inner surface of the walls of the arteries .
blood vessels become elastic and there is progressive thickening of the walls of larger blood vessels with an increase in connective tissues , which become stiffer .
this loss of elasticity increases with resistance to the flow of blood so that blood pressure also increases .
this in turn increases the work the heart must perform to maintain the flow of blood .
on the average , obese people have higher blood pressures than those with normal body weight .
this enlarged the constitutional right to life as including the right to livelihood .
it marks a step forward in the direction of reaching socio - economic justice to the deprived and vulnerable sections of humanity in this country .
the court is concerned with the balancing of interest .
when arbitrariness and perversion are writ large and brought out clearly , the court cannot shirk its duty and refuse its writ .
the courts under article 32 , 226 are free to devise any procedure appropriate for the particular purpose of the proceedings , namely the enforcement of fundamental rights .
it is only in exceptional cases of breach of a fundamental right that compensation may be awarded .
the life span is short .
the existence of these genetic syndromes brings forth . the fact that aging is a genetic phenomenon .
when something goes wrong with one or more of the genes concerned with aging , such syndromes result .
thus , while senescence and aging might lead to death , the varied symptoms of senescence could be brought about by a number of factors .
an interesting question arises from the above discussion .
it is then that the ' concerned individual would show many symptoms of aging very early in life and even may face death prematurely .
the genetic syndromes mentioned above ? down ' s syndrome , progeria and werner ' s syndrome ? fall into this category .
research on aging is also aimed at examining the possibility of controlling the rate of aging .
indeed experiments have already been initiated in this direction .
the dna - repair deficient cells are obtained from the skin of patients of a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) .
these patients exhibit extreme sensitivity to sunlight .

it results from a complex interplay of physiological , psychological and social factors .
limitations of the elderly can be remedied by changes in social customs , so that much can be done to improve the status of the aged .
the adaptability of the human organs makes it possible to compensate for many of the physiological impairments of aging .
i will be second to none in extending help when such help is required .
apart from judges lawyers are the most important officers of the court .
in almost every case before the courts , tribunals , etc . , parties engage lawyers to conduct a case .
lawyers / advocates / barristers / solicitors have been in existence since time immemorial .
in india , the legal profession and system as it exists today is not the result of historical growth as in the west .
yet it took deep roots , and grew in the indian socio - politic soil as a logical extension of the empire .
india , a land of diversity in caste , culture and religion , had various sets of laws and its people were governed by different systems .
village panchayats are controlled and supervised by zilla parishads , panchayat samitis and their officers .
the state government also has direct control over panchayats through the collector of the district .
district village panchayat officers work under zilla parishads to supervise and control the village panchayats , and are appointed by the state governments .
there is however , no proper machinery for the public to air their grievances and to control malpractices in zilla parishads .
vested interests in the government have always been found to be sheltering corrupt elements in the system and they are now well entrenched .
in view of these shortcomings , part ix , consisting of articles 243 to 243 - was inserted by the constitution ( 73rd amendment ) act , 1992 .
this pertains to panchayats and inter - alia provides that :
word ' acting ' is defined as " acting means filing an appearance or any pleadings or application in any court " .
action can be taken against them .
the senior - most member of the disciplinary committee is the chairman of the committee .
there is a growing feeling today jn almost every circle about the declining standards of the advocates .
today people feel lawyers a most undesirable necessity .
the honesty , integrity , fairness , fearlessness and reasonable fees is becoming a thing of the past .
bijjala was a brave warrior and a clever and powerful administrator .
he assumed all the titles of the earlier emperors .
inscriptions of bijjala ' s period speak of his heroism .
we read in the inscriptions that he was god - fearing and that he donated gifts liberally to the shaiva monks of the kalamukha sect .
being a far - sighted administrator , he treated all religions alike .
the duties of a treasurer were mainly two : looking after the state income and expenditure and keeping records .
it was no doubt a very responsible and difficult post .
we saw earlier that bijjala became an emperor by unfair means .
he naturally grew suspicious and it is fair to assume that he wanted to surround himself with honest and loyal officials .
bijjala wanted to verify whether there was any misappropriation and ordered an inquiry .
when the accounts were checked , they were - found to be correct to the last penny .
basava has brushed aside these allegations as baseless , saying that ' he is not in need of bijjala ' s money ' .
it is possible that basava utilised a part of the state wealth for the cause of his religion .
these were serious allegations and basava had to answer them .
the rift which began - in this way went on widening .
this is your outward purity ;
compassion is the root the popular conception of religion as a set of rigid and classified rituals meant exclusively for the privileged and learned classes was exploded by basava .
external religious symbols he did not discard : he made them occupy a secondary place .
the poor must have been really thrilled to hear that they too could belong to a religion as others did .
we must not , however , conclude that it was only the poor who felt drawn by the teachings of basava .
but there were some others who had become virashaivas for reasons unrelated to belief or conviction .
among these were ignorant people worshipping tribal gods and goddesses .
basava declared , " a man may belong to any caste .
the man of high - caste is one who wears a linga on the body . "
there were also cases of men going back from virashaivism to their old religion .
the temple was a well - established religious and social institution .
besides being a place of worship , it was the focal point of the town or village all the activities of the village centred round the temple .
we have seen earlier that the pashupatha shaiva monks lived in temples or mathas attached to them .
many of the shiva temples were strongholds of pashupatha shaivism .
the rich and the privileged built temples , spending enormous sums of money .
again , in those days when transport facilities were inadequate , going on a pilgrimage to places like varanasi and raraeshwaram was an adventure and a risk .
to basava and others , it appeared to be a waste of time , money and labour .
he was against calling them holeyas .
the untouchables were made to live outside the villages , in localities exclusively allotted to them .
besides , be himself was surrounded by many men belonging to the harijan caste , and they commanded everybody ' s respect .
it is necessary to have an idea of the spiritual evolution as experienced and expressed by the virashaiva mystics .
the evolution , according to them , takes place in six stages , where each stage is a reflection of the mental state of the aspirant .
bhakta at this stage , the devotee is the servant of the master and here begins his spiritual apprenticeship .
the divine grace begins to descend slowly on the aspirant and a sense of hope fills his mind .
the devotee , all the while , thinks of god as residing in the ishta - linga which he keeps on his palm during meditation .
but , at this stage , the devotee experiences that god resides within himself also .
there is a complete surrendering of one ' s will to god .
the final stage is soham , " i am he " .
basava ' s life was an open book .
he did not hide anything from his colleagues and followers .
he frankly gave expression to his shortcomings and sincerely repented for them .
for example , the fact that he was a brahmin by birth and the fact that he was an important official made him sometimes feel superior to others .
when praised by his admirers , he said : '
as a result , none of them wrote poems .
vacha - nas , originally , were not meant to be literature ; but quite a few of them are literature of a high quality .
it was a kind of poetic prose , comparable to the poetic prose of walt whitman ' s leaves of grass or rabindranatha tagore ' s gitanjali .
one advantage about the vachanas was the ease with which they could be composed .
the language was simple ; there were no rules like those of foot , pause and alliteration to be observed .
and , therefore , scholars as well as ordinary people were able to express themselves through the medium of vachanas effectively .
the compositions of basava are acknowledged as the model of vachpna literature .
though vachanas are not verse , it is possible to arrange each vachana in lines of varying lengths .
a vachana could run from three to thirty or thirty - five lines : there were no restrictions as regards the number .
there are vachanas which we feel came out spontaneously , inspired by an event .
it is true that there are vachanas of his which are devoid of any literary flavour ; but their number is small .
earlier , the poets wrote long narrative poems which had mythical stories for their theme .
there was little scope for expressing one ' s varied experiences of life and nature in such narratives .
they were sung to the accompaniment of musical instruments .
many earlier writers have called vachanas githas or song ' s and these songs were often set to music .
allama is said to have wandered from place to place singing his ' songs ' and playing upon a lyre called dandige .
we have seen earlier how basava reacted in certain situations , for example , when his cows were stolen .
basava was a keen observer of life and nature .
many images which he has employed are fresh and original .
he has employed innumerable images from the world of animals , plants , birds and insects .
to him , the world of god was also a reality , perhaps a greater reality .
elections to the panchayat will be held by the state election commission .
ii reservation of seats for the weaker sections and women has been made mandatory .
if any panchayat is dissolved before the expiry of this period , elections must be held within six months .
a piece of metal should receive the stamp of the mint and only then it is acceptable as a coin outside .
likewise , a human being must be acceptable here in this world , so that he may be acceptable in the other world .
sometimes , he uses rustic proverbs , idioms , and folk - beliefs to communicate his ideas to the people .
in one of his vachanas , basava observes that he knows ho metrical rules , but knows only how " to sing of his own accord " .
in another vachana , he teaches people how to employ words in their speech :
this vachana is itself a commentary on the language employed by basava in his writings .
to him , language was a tool and nothing but a tool to express himself wholly and precisely .
he cannot compete with the rich in building temples and thus show his love of god .
this is why he is humble .
basava comforts himself by imagining that his body itself is the shrine , the legs its pillars , and the head its golden cupola .
even this self - comforting attitude does not last long .
it takes a dramatic turn and becomes highly assertive in nature .
he says :
but these are sure victims of time .
they grow old and disintegrate .
wind and water do the rest .
it basava and his colleagues inspired the masses and created in them an eagerness for expressing themselves through language .
as a result , we see more than four hundred and fifty writers composing vachanas .
it is a kind of " mass literature " , if we could call it so .
it is true that many authors have composed beautiful vachanas .
but as it always happens , there is much that is also trash .
the real thing that astonishes any student of literature is that basava and his colleagues were able to inspire so many people to take to writing .
to a barber , the mirror , scissors , comb and the razor and his act of shaving may symbolise things and experiences pertaining to his sadhane .
vachanas are flowers which blossomed out of the native soil .
a good , representative anthology of vachanas could be looked upon without hesitation , as a distinct contribution which kannada has made to indian and world literature .
they affectionately remember him as basavanna ( the final - anmz means an elder brother in kannada ) .
the villagers say ' basava ' ' basava ' whenever there is a calamity or a danger , with the hope that it will be averted .
every year , during the month of june , a day is set apart for celebrating the basava jayanti festival .
the unlettered people clean up their houses , take a purifying bath , wear new clothes , go to the shiva temples and offer worship on that day .
it is also a day when special dishes are prepared and eaten after being offered to god .
in towns and cities , lectures and purana - recitations are arranged in memory of basava and his movement .
as days went by , it attracted more and more people and the virashaiva missionaries spread their religion with zeal .
there were great mystics , statesmen , poet - philosophers and scholars who did their best to popularise the religion .
but none of them could be called a social - reformer .
but basava ' s movement had its own impact on the kannada literature .
prior to basava , the poets used to choose only mythological themes .
the virashaiva poets who followed basava chose human themes and composed their poems in simple language .
' many of them were lost owing to negligence , and many were destroyed during muslim invasions in the thirteenth century .
vijayanagar empire was founded in 1336 a . d . , with the intention of saving hinduism from the onslaught of islam .
under the benevolent patronage of these kings the vachanas were collected , arranged and commented upon during the fifteenth century .
the whole process took not more than two minutes .
a bowler must always bowl his best even at the nets .
a fast bowler needs physical strength and stamina ; a slow bowler relies mainly on great accuracy .
on a good wicket a bowier may be called upon to bowl from 40 to 70 overs .
ramadhin bowled as many as 98 overs in a test innings when playing for the west indies against england at birmingham in 1967 .
if the bowler does this , it will only result in yet another catch being dropped .
a sure pair of hands , agility , anticipation , a clean pick - up and a good throw can be developed by hard practice .
these are two terms often loosely used and seldom clearly understood .
discipline means carrying out the orders of the captain both in letter and in spirit .
off the field a player should take care of himself and keep a hundred per cent fit .
team - work is another important factor for the success of any side .
a captain who favours individuals is not only likely to fail as a captain but will never command the respect of the players .
his duty is to his team and his country .
cricket is one game where umpires ' decisions should never be ques - tioned .
even more than the selectors , their task is a thankless one .
their mistakes are noticed and no credit is given to them for their correct decisions .
as long as umpires do their job efficiently , and even more important , impartially , they should be treated with the greatest respect .
formerly the boundaries differed with the size of the ground .
this resulted in one ground having a 75 - yard boundary and another 85 yards .
that is why some of the happiest hours of my cricketing life were spent on the cricket fields of england .
cricket is one game which is played not only according to the laws of cricket but more in the spirit of sportsmanship .
when a difficult situation arises all that one has to ask oneself is , " is it fair ? "
in other words , what is fair is cricket and what is not just is n ' t cricket .
that is why we have the saying , " it is n ' t cricket " when anything unfair is done .
only in the case of cricket is this phrase used .
there are many examples of outstanding sportsmanship in cricket .
he asked me what i felt .
" for how long do you feel this , vijay ? " asked duleepsinhji .
i replied , " until the bowler starts his run to bowl the first ball .
then this feeling disappears and all that matters is the ball , the bowler and my bat . "
duleepsinhji smilingly replied , " that is only nervous tension .
this brings his concentration to the highest pitch which is necessary to be successful in the highest class of cricket .
those who are over - confident and complacent about their batting do not concentrate enough and lose their wickets .
that depends upon your treatment plan .
the more complicated your spacing or bite problem is , and the older you are , the longer the period of treatment , usually .
some patients may have to wear a permanent retainer .
will treatment be uncomfortable ?
cut down on sweets , chips and soda .
sugary and starchy foods generate acid and plaque that can cause tooth decay and promote gum disease .
cut healthy , hard foods like carrots or apples into smaller pieces .
many criminals are never even apprehended .
those who are have more than an even chance to escape by taking advantage of the loopholes of the law .
the inherent drama of a criminal trial in the very nature of things always favours the defence .
except in matrimonial actions and libel cases a civil trial is usually free of such influence .
on the other hand , corruption , favouritism and perjury are especially operative in criminal trials .
every period has its own cause celebre .
it is a hearsay that wealthy and powerful malefactors escape while the poor and friendless go to jail .
all this naturally makes the task of the police investigation of crimes extremely difficult .
this apart , we find that a good bit of the time of the police force is taken in the security and other arrangements for the vips .
demonstrations , bandhs , strikes , hartals and agitations have increasingly become a part of our public life and call for considerable attention of the police force .
investigation of crimes occupies comparatively lower priority in the functioning of the police .
the result as such is deterioration in the quality of investigation and the increasing inability of the police force to adduce credible evidence at the trial .
it is plain that such a state of affairs would lead to chaotic and anarchical conditions .
litigiousness is a strong characteristic of human nature .
all over the world a forensic display attracts the admiration of the multitudes .
curiously , legal technicalities are despised ; at the same time , their ingenuity is applauded .
disappointed litigants are not always silent .
for many reasons legal institutions lag behind changes of public opinion much more than other institutions .
the procedure in the civil and criminal courts have become too technical , cumbersome , expensive and slow .
there are too many appeals .
the judges , lawyers , and the defendents have now vested interest in this procedure .
they are so much accustomed to treading the beaten path that they cannot tolerate any departure or change .
this , however , is only against public authorities .
public interest litigation ( pil ) has meant a change in the traditional function of the supreme court .
through public interest litigation , citizens seek judicial intervention in a number of matters involving the interest of the public at large .
there is little distinction between public interest litigation ( pil ) and social action litigation ( sal ) .
a trial , particularly a criminal trial , is as much a rite as a religious ceremony .
there is a persisting memory of the anarchy of the period of self - help .
when the king asserted his power over warring and intractable nobles , justice was established as the very foundations of kingdoms .
in his gratitude he invested justice with special attributes of sanctity .
legal justice was synonymous with social justice , and it was natural enough that it should be appreciated very highly .
today the state undertakes many administrative services , and the contact of the average citizen with the state is far more frequent through its administrative than its judicial agencies .
india today summed up ' the situation thus : judges today are a community under siege .
they are being divested of the single virtue that has been their armour and sword credibility .
it is not the tragedy of just a few hundred individuals that their ability and intentions are being brought into question .
inevitability of decline in physiological functions and awareness of death have long been a major influence in different religions and philosophical systems .
aging is a normal part of the life span .
it is associated with a gradual reduction in the reserve capacities of most of the organ systems of the body .
in other words , we can define aging as a process characterised by progressive decline in all physiological functions .
during spore formation bacteria form an impermeable coat around the genetic material and some protoplasm ( fig . 5 ) .
the rest of the cell degenerates .
when a favourable condition ensues , the spores become active again and divide .
in the process , nature does not seem to mind sacrificing a part or whole of the parental cell .
in multicellular higher organisms , propagation of species is always by sexual reproduction .
the transmission of genetic information is a complex phenomenon and the offsprings are never a true copy of either of the parents .
further , in all such higher organisms , the parent cells or the parents themselves , die sometime after performing the reproductive function .
lular organisms the mode of reproduction seems to have changed from asexual to sexual .
second , is an important event called crossing over .
what does this mean in molecular terms ?
it is this process that leads to an enormous variety of characteristic features that are noticed in individuals .
when this type of crossing over occurs in a somatic cell during the mitotic division , it is referred to as somatic mutation .
wrinkles appear due to loss of fat underneath the skin .
the skin also becomes thin and rough .
it becomes less elastic and brittle .
after birth , the growth and development of a child occurs at remarkable speed .
during teenage the rate of growth starts slowing down and at about the age of twenty years it begins to plateau .
the plateau extends upto the age of thirty to thirty - five years after which several symptoms of ' aging ' start making their appearance slowly .
the rate of this decline increases with age .
scientists and engineers worry about the soundness of all the working systems until the vehicle reaches the target planet .
how long will it fly ?
that is the way nature too seems to feel about us for its sole aim seems to be to propagate the species , after which aging commences .
thus aging and the terminal point of that process , that is death , are not sudden in a normal healthy individual .
it is not in the nature of adversary litigation but it is a challenge and an opportunity to the government and its officers to make basic human rights meaningful .
this does not hold good in the present setting .
justice should be - come easily available to the lowly and the lost .
' both hearing and vision become less efficient .
it is commonly seen that people beyond the age of fifty and sixty keep asking the other person to repeat what is said .
similarly visual capacity decreases after the age of forty .
most people notice loss of sharpness in their close - up vision .
as a result , they tend to increase the distance of the reading material .
since reading becomes difficult , reading glasses adorn the face .
reading glasses ( spectacles ) are nothing but a magnifying device to make reading from a particular distance easy .
the change in the sleeping pattern also causes psychological problems in some people .
they tend to feel that they are suffering from insomnia ( a condition of not being able to sleep ) and sometimes resort to drugs .
there are a variety of chemical reactions taking place in the cells of the body to convert the food that is consumed into energy .
moreover , several other substances are synthesised in the body utilising the raw materials supplied through one ' s diet .
all these reactions are carried out with utmost efficiency and specificity with the help of biocatalysts called enzymes .
these chemical conversions comprising synthesis of some compounds and degradation of others are collectively referred to as metabolism .
the rate at which these various reactions occur is known as the rate of metabolism .
the metabolic rate has a bearing on the overall growth and efficiency of the body system .
the body ' s metabolism begins to slow down by the age of twenty - five .
according to one estimate a 2 per cent reduction in the caloric requirement occurs every ten years .
however , a number of people put on fat during and after adulthood because they continue to consume excessive calories than actually needed .
the master organ , the brain , loses 20 per cent of its weight from adulthood to old age .
the brain has about 10 cells called neurons .
after thirty or thirty - five years , these cells begin to degenerate at a rate of 100,000 per day !
since these cells are in such an excessive number their loss is not felt by a normal healthy individual .
however , closer examination reveals loss of mental functioning particularly that of short - term memory .
the neurological effects of stroke vary from one case to the other depending upon the site and extent of damage .
paralysis , seen quite often in old people , is the result of stroke .
in severe cases , death may result .
endocrine system hormones are very important in the regulation of many physiological systems .
impairments in endocrine glands were believed to be a cause for aging , but it no longer holds true .
when the pancreas fails to produce adequate amounts of insulin , diabetes occurs .
in other words , the cells are unable to utilise the glucose for energy and other purposes .
kidney the kidney removes waste from the body by separating them from the blood and forming urine .
with advance in age , the concentrating ability of the kidneys falls , such that more water intake is necessary to flush out the waste .
can we then compare the aging process to a clock ?
much like the setting of an alarm clock to ring at a specific time , the body too has its time when deterioration begins .
on the other hand , one can also see the in - built timer as a tightly wound spring of a clock .
nerve cells and skeletal muscle cells are typical examples of this type .
the body also has large non - cellular areas in between the cells composed of the intercellular substances which form the third component .
the protein , collagen , is one main intercellular substance .
it provides support in the skin , cartilage , tendons and other such connective tissues .
these three components are subject to physiological controls that are operative in the body .
quite often theories in one category overlap with those in another .
the exact sequence of the amino acids for each protein is coded on the dna .
the mrna is then translated into protein .
the machine could be damaged by outside and unexpected events like accidents .
a metal spoke or wire could be broken .
if the accident is a major one then severe damage can occur .
however , there is a difference .
they do not possess an internal mechanism to take care . of the damage .
this is another aspect to strengthen the view that species longevity - is genetically programmed .
also , some higher animals with good correlation between longevity and ability to repair dna by replacement of thyminedimers following ultraviolet radiation in different mammals .
therefore , even if some genes are affected , some undamaged good genes are available to carry out the prescribed function .
in a way this theory permeates into all other theories of aging .
there are quite a number of other theories to explain why we age .
they attain validity only when such spontaneous events have a genetic control behind them .
every living organism has to die .
if the whole cycle of events are so inevitable then why study aging at all ?
it is clear that all the outward and cellular changes that occur with age have their root cause at the levels of genes .
in recent years , scientists have provided some direct evidence to prove that aging is indeed a genetically controlled process .
firstly , a gene on the x - chromosome which is otherwise inactive has been found to become ' active ' in older individuals .
what is not clear however is how these genes on chromosome - 1 and x - chromosome become active .
what is the signal that puts them into action ?
what happens if these genes , through accidents of mutation , become active at a wrong point of the time scale of one ' s life span ?
indeed , nature itself has provided some answers to these questions .
there are atleast four genetic disorders in human beings that are characterised by signs of premature aging .
these patients exhibit the features of old age when they are actually ' young ' in a chronological sense .
these individuals , as can be predicted , die very early .
the four genetic syndromes are down ' s syndrome , progeria , werner ' s syndrome , and cockayne ' s syndrome .
only some species of anopheles transmit malaria .
many are important for the environment they live in , and so we only want to control the species that pass the disease to us .
the different species behave in different ways .
some species might live by freshwater and bite animals , whereas others might live near salt water and bite humans .
if we understand the behaviour , we can target our control methods .
by targeting our pesticides on the right place or time of day , we can destroy the disease - carriers , but not harm any other species .
the researchers are collecting adult mosquitoes and larvae from their natural habitat and studying their dna .
each dna profile can then be matched with the behaviour and habitat the mosquito was collected in .
this information can be used to monitor mosquito populations and determine whether action should be taken to eliminate those species that transmit disease .
article 19 ( l ) ( b ) secures to all citizens of india the right .
any citizen can travel to or reside in any part of india .
both the rights get affected whenever restrictions are placed on the movement or residence of a citizen .
( 1977 ) 4 scc 98 ) .
the protection afforded by clause 2 is , however , attracted only in respect of the punishment inflicted by a court of law or judicial tribunal .
it does not immunize a person from proceedings which are not before a court of law .
233 ) .
similarly , a person punished departmentally may be prosecuted in a court of law ( venkataraman v . india , 1954 sc 375 ) .
but , even after the commencement of the constitution , the property clauses remained the most contentious .
they caused sharp confrontations between the legislature and the judiciary and necessitated several constitutional amendments .
instead , in part xii of the constitution , a new chapter - chapter iv - and a new article - 300a was added .
thus , the right to property ceases to be a fundamental right but still remains a legal right .
article 300a gives protection against executive action but not against legislative decision .
( also see under chapter 11 ) .
rajya sabha : the rajya sabha is , as its name indicates , the council of states .
the different states of the union have not been given equal representation in the rajya sabha .
the number of representatives from each state in india depends largely on its population .
under the constitution , rajya sabha consists of not more than 250 members .
lok sabha : the other house - the lok sabha - is the house of the people .
it is directly elected by the people .
in addition , the president may nominate not more than two members to represent the anglo - indian community ( article 331 ) .
the maximum strength of the house envisaged in the constitution is thus 552 .
similarly , in the absence of the chairman , the deputy chairman presides over the rajya sabha .
generally speaking , the position of the speaker in india more or less corresponds to that of the speaker of the house of commons .
his office is one of prestige , splendour and authority .
he is the head of lok sabha .
within the house and in all matters connected with the house , his word is final .
his salary and allowances are charged on the consolidated fund of india - that is , they do not have to be voted by parliament .
his conduct cannot be discussed except on a substantive motion .
except money bills and other financial bills , a bill may originate in either house .
financial bills : the constitution makes a distinction between money bills and financial bills .
generally speaking , a financial bill may be any bill which relates to revenue or expenditure .
besides providing for any of the matters specified in the constitution for a money bill , a financial bill may also provide for other matters .
a court , being an outside authority , does not have the power to investigate the matter .
article 122 specifically forbids any inquiry by courts into proceedings of parliament .
the immunity from external influence or interference , however , does not mean an unrestricted licence of speech within the walls of parliament .
( m . s . sharma v . sri krishna sinha , air 1959 sc 395 ) .
the president ' s ordinance - making power has been challenged in courts in a number of cases .
the constitution has assigned some special powers to the rajya sabha .
under article 249 , parliament may legislate even on matters in the state list .
constituent powers : under article 368 , parliament exercises constituent powers in accordance with the procedure laid down for different categories of amendments .
parliamentary control over the executive is political in nature .
the speaker ' s action covered all the members of the council of ministers headed by shri chandra shekhar .
janata dal ( s ) was recognised as a political party with 54 members .
the seven members who joined after the date of split were disqualified .
they continued to be shown as among the 59 janata dal members in all official lok sabha records .
article 129 provides that the supreme court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court .
( daphtanj v . gupta , air 1971 sc 1132 ; namboodripad v . nambiar , air 1970 sc 2015 ) .
court of record also means that it can punish for its own contempt .
it does not inhibit genuine and well - intentioned criticism of court and its functioning .
fair and reasonable criticism of a judicial act in the interest of public good does not constitute contempt .
the supreme court has original , appellate and advisory jurisdiction .
original jurisdiction means the power to hear and determine a dispute in the first instance .
article 143 of the constitution confers upon the supreme court advisory jurisdiction .
in the keshvaand bharti case , the supreme court upheld this position .
article 32 in the chapter on fundamental rights specifically confers the power of judicial review on the supreme court .
this becomes obvious from the use of the term .
it applies in a case where a person is alleged to have been illegally detained .
under article 168 , the governor is a part of the legislature of the state .
he addresses the members of the legislature and may send messages ( articles 175 - 176 ) .
without the governor ' s assent , no bill can become law even after its being passed by the two houses ( article 200 ) .
there is a fifth possibility which is often not mentioned , viz .
this power corresponds to the power of the president under article 123 .
also , they are subject to the same restrictions as laws passed by the legislature .
the ordinance may be withdrawn by the governor at any time ( article 213 ) .
the bihar governor promulgated 256 ordinances during 1967 - 1981 .
the governor ' s power of suspension was held to be subject to the rules framed by the supreme court .
at present only bihar , u . p . , maharashtra , tamil nadu and karnataka states have a legislative council ( article 168 ) .
elections to the council are to be held by the system of proportional representation by single transferable vote ( articles 170 - 171 ) .
the government of india act , 1919 , provided for a considerable measure of devolution of authority to the provinces .
every proclamation must cease to operate at the expiry of two months unless approved by resolutions of the two houses .
in the constituent assembly , while replying to the critics of this provision , dr .
first , an amendment of the constitution can be initiated only .
there is no separate constituent body for the purposes of amendment of the constitution , constituent power also being vested in ' parliament ' .
article 338 provides for the setting up of a national commission for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes .
it controlled foreign affairs and decided issues of peace and war .
also the popular assembly exercised full control over the executive .
discussions in the assembly were marked by elements of purity , fairness , frankness and freedom .
voting was by tickets ( salaka ) ? slips of wood of different colours to represent different opinions .
the act was said to be the " prime charter of the indian legislature " inaugurating the " system of legislative devolution iii india . "
the act introduced important changes in the machinery for legislation , both at the central and provincial levels .
it reconstituted the council of the governor - general . hereafter , it was to consist of five ( instead of the erstwhile four ) ordinary members .
the act required that the members of the legislative councils should include elected as well as nominated members .
the 1909 act enlarged the functions of the legislative councils .
it gave to the mehibers the power to move resolutions on the budget and on any matter of general public interest and to divide the council upon them .
the resolutions were to take the form of recommendations to the executive government , but jthe government was not bound to accept them .
the communal system of representation initiated by the act poisoned the future public life of india and increased separatist tendencies .
these moderates hailed the reforms but the congress at its 1919 amritsar session called them " inadequate , unsatisfactory , and disappointing . "
the legislature under the 1919 reforms : the constitutional reforms of the 1919 act came into force in 1921 .
as was expected of them , and as the terms of their pledge to their constituents demanded , they discharged their function as legislators and ministers .
their programme in the councils was described by them as " a policy of uniform , continuous and consistent obstruction . "
the congress felt that the act had been imposed on india against the declared will of its people .
the indian people , the congress declared , could only recognise a constitutional structure which had been framed by them .
the federal part of the 1935 act , however , never came into operation as the princely states could not be persuaded to accede to the federation .
two important occasions to oppose the government were when voting took place on the railways and secondly , in the general budget .
the cut motions were moved in order to ventilate indian grievances and censuring the government for its negligence in action and antipathy to the interests of the people .
the governor - general ceased to be a part of the dominion legislature and his power of dissolution ended .
thus , the governor - general became a mere constitutional head of the country and the sovereignty of the dominion legislature was complete .
section 8 of the act conferred on the constituent assembly full legislative power .
the house having agreed , a committee under the chairmanship of g . v . mavalankar was appointed on 20 august 1947 to consider the matter .
in fact , the relationship between the union and the states in india represents a compromise between the following two conflicting considerations :
need for national integrity and a strong union under exceptional circumstances .
the president is elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of the rajya sabha , the lok sabha and the legislative assemblies of the states .
he is the nominal or the constitutional executive , the real or the political executive being the council of ministers .
the ministers must be members of parliament and are collectively responsible to the lok sabha .
also , it has to be based on specific grounds .
it is , therefore , the officers ? and not ministers ? who have to explain if things go wrong in the process of implementation .
this , in a nutshell , is the raison d ' etre of parliamentary surveillance of administration .
the parliament has to keep a watch over the behaviour of the administration .
but in order to be able to conduct meaningful scrutiny and call the administration to account , the parliament must have the technical resources and information wherewithal .
this is sought to be achieved through what is called the parliament library and its research , reference , documentation and information services .
representational , grievance ventilation , educational and advisory role : the primary function of the parliament in a modern democracy is to represent the people .
in recent decades , emphasis has shifted more and more to the representational and grievance ventilation role of the parliament .
the parliament represents the changing moods and needs of the people .
it is not only a microcosm and mirror of the people , but also a barometer of their mood and pulse rate .
parliament of india more and more truly mirrors the mosaic of indian society .
law - making ? developmental , social engineering and legitimatisational role : law - making is the traditional function of a legislature .
under the constitution of india , parliament is the supreme legislative body at the national level .
it can make laws on a wide range of subjects allotted to it under the union and the concurrent lists in the seventh schedule of the constitution .
since residuary power vests in the parliament , it can also make laws in areas not specifically assigned to states .
the most important aspect of legislation lies in its vital social or sociological ramifications .
in a society particularly in a state of flux like ours , the parliament alone can provide the basis and the catalytic agency for social change .
the main thrust of legislative activity has to be on social legislation , i . e . , legislation aimed at directing social change and economic development .
they believed that the parliament had no power to revoke the mandate to build a welfare state and an egalitarian society .
the secular character of the state could not , likewise , be done away with .
in some cases there is a difference of opinion among the judges as regards a particular element forming an element of the basic feature .
( b ) he is of unsound mind ;
( c ) he is an undischarged insolvent ; ( d )
( e ) he is so disqualified by any law made by parliament ; and
no such notification is issued more than three months prior to the date on which the term of office of the retiring members is due to expire .
the returning officer , with the approval of the election commission , fixes and notifies the place at which the polling is to be held .
the returning officer , after examining the validity of nomination papers , publishes a list of validly nominated candidates .
the election to the lok sabha , being direct , requires the territory of india to be divided into suitable territorial constituencies .
every parliamentary constituency is a single member constituency .
he declares the result and reports it to the election commission and to the secretary - general of the concerned house .
however before giving his decision , he is required to obtain the opinion of the election commission in this matter .
the petition can be presented by any candidate at such election , or by any voter .
some of the bask rules of procedure and conduct of business have been laid down in the constitution itself .
at the beginning of the sitting each day , before the speaker takes the chair , the existence of quorum is ascertained .
normally , after the house is adjourned sine die , it is prorogued within the next few days by the president .
lok sabha continues for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting .
once the house has been dissolved , the dissolution is irrevocable .
he was the spokesman or the ' speaker ' of the commons before the king .
he takes no part in the debate of the house ; he presides over the meetings of the house .
generally speaking , the position of the speaker in india , more or less corresponds to that of the speaker of the house of commons .
his office is one of prestige , splendour and authority .
he is the head of the lok sabha .
the smooth and orderly conduct of the business in the house is primarily his responsibility .
the speaker regulates the admission of visitors and press correspondents to the galleries and is responsible for security arrangements in regard there to .
in the event of any breach of his orders he may award necessary punishment to the visitors under the orders of the house .
the speaker has to be satisfied in regard to the genuineness and voluntary character of a member ' s letter of resignation before accepting the resignation .
he listens to their views , grievances and suggestions and takes necessary action .
all members including ministers are expected to approach the speaker in his chamber by previous appointments .

to avoid this , the rules of the respective houses have laid down certain conditions governing the admissibility of a question .
with several agitated members speaking at the same time , the task of the presiding officer becomes very difficult .
also , with the exception of the half - an - hour discussion , under the question procedure discussions cannot be allowed .
only one matter can be raised in a notice .
thereafter , other members take part in the discussion .
the member who raises the discussion has no right to reply .
there is no formal motion nor is there any vote .
every question to be decided by the house must , therefore , be proposed by a member as a motion .
any matter of public importance can be the subject matter of a motion .
a debate orra ' motion passes through four stages :
( a ) moving the motion ;
( b ) proposing the question by the speaker / chairman ; ( c )
debate or discussion where permissible ; and ( d ) vote or decision of the house .
after the members and the minister have spoken , the mover may again speak exercising his right of reply .
at the conclusion of the discussion , the amendments / substitute motions , if any , are put to the vote of the house and disposed of .
unlike motions in general , forms of resolutions have been provided by the rules of procedure concerning both the houses .
as far as their effect is concerned , resolutions passed by the parliament fall in the following categories :
resolutions expressing merely an opinion of the house are not binding on the government .
as a matter of practice , it rests entirely on the discretion of the government whether or not to give effect to the opinions expressed in these resolutions .
resolutions adopted by the house in matters concerning its own proceedings are binding and have the force of law .
their validity cannot be challenged in courts .
resolutions having a statutory effect , if adopted , are binding on the government and have the force of law .
in such a case , should the resolution be treated as amounting to a vote of censure on the government ?
in that case the it tern is not mentioned in , or brought before the house .
a censure motion is distinct from a no - confidence motion .
the motion should be specific and self - explanatory so as to record the reasons for the censure , precisely and briefly .
the speaker ' s decision whether the motion is in order or not for any reason is final .
no leave of the house is required to move a censure motion .
it is not as if the government can tax , borrow and spend money the way it likes .
since there is a limit to the resources the state can mobilise , the need for proper budgeting arises to allocate scarce resources to various governmental activities .
every item of expenditure has to be well - thought out and the total outlay worked out for a specific period .
also , there must be the sanction of the people behind all these financial proposals , expressed clearly through their chosen representatives .
it is in this context that the budget of the government of india is presented before both the houses of parliament every year .
the essential features of the financial procedures followed in india are laid down in the constitution which ensures the supremacy of the lok sabha in financial matters .
a . the draft bill was submitted in slightly amended form to a committee of the all parties conference held at delhi in january 1925 .
finally a drafting committee published the bill .
the bill was sent to an influential member of the labour party in britain .
the bill had the first reading after it was introduced in the house of commons .
only verbal , formal and consequential amendments are allowed to be moved at this stage .
in passing an ordinary bill , a simple majority of members present and voting is required .
in a parliamentary system with the government enjoying majority support in the lok sabha , a government bill , therefore , has got nearly full guarantee of easy passage .
these , besides providing for any of the matters specified in the constitution for a money bill , also provide for other matters .
let us , for the sake of convenience , divide the financial bills into two categories :
category b : bills containing provisions involving expenditure from the consolidated fund .
accordingly , all financial bills are not money bills .
besides , there is a slight procedural difference as far as the passage of money bills and financial bills through both the houses is concerned .
the discussion helps the government to bring a comprehensive government bill on the subject , if necessary .
the notice is to be accompanied by a copy of the bill and an explanatory statement of objects and reasons .
in case the bill contains proposals for delegated legislation , a memorandum regarding delegated legislation is also appended to the bill .
moreover , in committees the government may willingly concede a point or two and accept constructive suggestions from opposition members .
last , committees provide useful forums for the utilisation of experience and ability that may otherwise remain untapped .
they also constitute a valuable training ground for future ministers and presiding officers .
this procedure helps in educating the public in the functioning of the parliamentary system and focusing their attention on important public issues .
the former if not carried out properly may defeat the very purpose of the policy .
their very performance has to be assessed with reference to their efficiency and economy for both are interdependent .
further , no administrative system can perhaps be 100 per cent free from problems like misuse of power , negligence , delay , indifference , nepotism , etc .
the financial committees are said to play a very important role as the watch dogs of the parliament .
the three financial committees bring to light inefficiencies , waste and indiscretion hi the implementation of policies and programmes approved by the parliament .
elections for the 296 seats assigned to the british - indian provinces were completed by july - august 1946 .
the representatives of some of the indian states had already entered the assembly on 28 april 1947 .
by 15 august 1947 most of the states were represented in the assembly and the remaining states also sent their representatives in due course .
in the rajya sabha it consists of 11 members , including the deputy chairman .
the chairman of the rajya sabha is the ex - officio chairman of the committee .
the function of the committee is to recommend the time that should be allocated for the transaction of such legislative and other business as initiated by the government .
in the rajya sabha , however , the committee also recommends the time that should be allocated for the discussion of private members ' bills and resolutions .
the role the committee plays in assisting the house in allocating time for various types of business has always been of considerable significance .
at the sittings of the committee , the atmosphere is cordial and the spirit of give and take between the government and the opposition has been very prominent .
committee on private members ' bills and resolutions : this committee of lok sabha consists of 15 members with the deputy speaker as its chairman .
there is no such committee in the rajya sabha .
to facilitate matters , the lok sabha constituted a committee consisting of 15 members , to consider requests from members seeking leave of absence from the house .
in the rajya sabha such matters are considered by the house itself .
the committee also performs such other functions in respect of attendance of members in the house as may be assigned to it by the speaker from time to time .
rules committee : each house has a rules committee .
in lok sabha , the rules committee consists of 15 members , including the speaker who is the ex officio chairman of the committee .
in rajya sabha , the committee consists of 16 members including the chairman and the deputy chairman .
suggestions for amendments or additions to the rules can be made by any member of the house , minister or the committee itself .
the committee , thus , acts as an ombudsman or public grievances committee .
the committee of privileges is constituted usually every year by the presiding officers of the respective houses .
in the lok sabha , it consists of 15 members while in the rajya sabha , it has 10 members .
the functions of this committee are of a semi - judicial nature and it is vested with wide powers .
although its findings are subject to the ultimate decision of the house , it enjoys the latter ' s confidence and its recommendations are seldom rejected .
the committee performs a vital role in safeguarding the powers and prestige of the parliament and its members .
in order to watch the implementation of such assurances each of the houses of parliament has constituted a committee on government assurances .
the committee keeps a regular watch to ensure implementation of its recommendation by the government .
the committee in the lok sabha consists of 15 members and in the rajya sabha of 10 members .
the possibility of a close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee , in itself exercise a salutary effect on the administration .
there is no doubt that the committees of parliament have proved a helpful adjunct to the indian political system .
if the decisions of the presiding officer were to be influenced by the executive , then the very basis of parliamentary democracy would be in danger .
this resolution was adopted and in fact became " the source of the creation and the authority of the assembly department . "
their names were changed to ' lok sabha secretariat ' and ' rajya sabha secretariat ' , respectively , in 1954 in keeping with the hindi nomenclature .
dedication , courtesy , self - control , patience , coolness and tolerance in dealing with members and others ;
precision and accuracy and the habit of placing before the speaker full facts and rendering impartial advice ;
( vi ) presence of mind , the quality of being a listener with a smile ;
in the service of parliamentary institutions , the journey ' s end never comes .
thanks to the training procedures and facilities , the parliament in india can take legitimate pride in having done well .
it has been ruled that members should address each other in third person .
it has been ruled quite often that while speaking , members should not repeat arguments , except when it is absolutely necessary to give emphasis to a point .
it , however , does not apply to matters of privilege or where disciplinary jurisdiction of the house with respect to its own members is concerned .
tolerance of the opposite viewpoint is the spirit of parliamentary ethos .
the house discusses subjects that are generally complex and sometimes contentious .
members should not approach the chair personally . they may send chits to the officers at the table , if necessary .
also , members should not leave the chambers immediately after delivering their speeches .
to be absent when the latter is replying is a breach of parliamentary etiquette .
in the interests of decorum and dignity of the house members are required not to indulge in any flippancy .
lady members are expected to desist from knitting in the house .
( xiii ) conduct of a member involving corruption in the execution of his office as a member is treated by the house as a breach of privilege .
adjoining the chamber and co - terminous with it are two covered corridors called the inner and outer lobbies .
these lobbies are well furnished to make them a comfortable place for members to sit and have informal discussions among themselves .
in the first floor of the lok sabha chamber are located the various public galleries and the press gallery .
to the right of the press gallery are situated diplomatic and distinguished visitors ' galleries .
the lok sabha chamber with a floor area of about 446 sq . metres and seating capacity for 550 members , is provided with a modern sound amplifying system .
the automatic vote recording equipment installed in the lok sabha chamber enables the members to record their votes quickly in cases of division .
it has a seating capacity of 250 .
devendranath tagore , roy ' s second successor to the samaj , was six years old .
ramakrishna paramahamsa was born in the village of kamar - pukur in bengal when ramalinga was thirteen .
madame blavatsky and colonel olcott , in new york , in 1875 ( the year after ramalinga ' s passing ) founded the theosophical society .
they moved to bombay in 1879 , and thence to madras in 1882 .
its principles were the same as those of the theosophical society founded in new york ten years later .
his father , ramaiah pillai , of saiva faith and belonging to the vellala community , was village accountant and teacher .
his mother , chinnammai , belonged to chinnakavanam in the vicinity of penned , a village in chengelpet district , near madras .
chinnammai was his sixth wife , and she bore him two sons , sabapathy and parasuraman , and two daughters , unnamulai and sundaram - bal .
it is even said that siva himself came in the garb of the ascetic , disappearing after walking a few steps from the house .
they lived at 39 veerasami pillai street , near seven wells , in the present postal zone 1 of madras .
of his early boyhood experiences the poet recalls , address -
when ramalinga was five , his brother sabapathy started teaching him .
but ramalinga was indifferent and spent his time day - dreaming .
he used to play truant , wandering in the streets and sauntering in the corridors of the kandaswamy temple near - by , all through the day .
unable to control him , sabapathy fillai put him in charge of a tamil savant , sabapathy mudaliar of kanchipuram , who had been his own teacher .
the savant proved equally ineffective .
discoverign that his boy - pupil was already drawing audiences in the temple with his talks and songs , he gave up the task .
losing patience , sabapathy pillai forbade his wife , parvati , to feed or clothe ramalinga .
counselling him graciously , she prevailed upon him at last to please his brother and to take to his studies seriously .
he promised , requesting however that he might be provided with a room of his own on the second floor where he could pursue his studies on his own .
the request was granted .
it was probably during these days that , dispossessed , he turned a juvenile ascetic for a while .
in a poem he recounts to his god :
and for this , o lord my mother ,
it is noteworthy that he addresses the lord as mother in this poem .
this experience may also explain his pre - occupation with the problem of hunger in his later years .
it was enough for his brother that ramalinga remained at home .
ramalinga set a mirror against the wall , and set in front of it a naked flamea wick burning in oil .
he started composing songs even at this age , or perhaps earlier , as he himself says to his lord :
it was a series of thirty - one verses , of which the following is sung widely today in tamil nadu :
one day sabapathy , who had a discourse scheduled in the house of a patron , named somu chettiar , was ill with fever .
without notes , without palm - leaf scripts , ramalinga spoke .
this was the first talk that he , coming out of the loneliness of his closed room , gave .
chief among these was a ripe , orthodox saivite called armuga navalar .
navalar felt that ratnalinga ' s new religion of sanmarga gave elbow room to other religions , particularly christianity .
he instituted a suit against ramalinga for alleged defamation in a discourse that ramalinga had delivered in chidambaram .
reference to this may be found in some of his verses quoted earlier .
people from distant places left their homes to be near him .
they invited him to functions and musical recitals in their houses .
they considered it a blessing to be of service to him .
he became a cult and a legend .
some learned brahmins in the crowd queried , ' so brahman cannot be conceived by the mind ? '
' no , since brahman is beyond the phenomenal world ( mayo ) and the mind is of the phenomenal world . '
' brahman can be known by soul - knowledge or soul - experience , ' said ramalinga , ' and the soul knows itself .
ramalinga says that such logic is right in theory but does not work in practice .
the head is the president in whom all the executive power vests and in whose name it is to be exercised .
he is also the supreme commander of the armed forces .
it has been held , however , that unlike the u . s . president , our president is only a nominal or constitutional head of the executive .
it would , however , be wrong to assert that we have adopted the british parliamentary system in toto .
to name a few ; the u . k . constitution is still largely unitary , while ours is largely federal .
the free eating house he named samarasa veda dharma salai ( free house of the good fellowship ) .
the same year he founded a school , sanmarga bhodini ( school for the fellowship ) .
the school however did not run for long .
during this time ramalinga also planned to bring out a monthly magazine called sanmarga viveka vriddi ( orientation to the path ) .
after the opening of the free eating house in 1867 , ramalinga shifted from karunguzhi to vadalur .
the construction was started in june 1871 .
he did not call it koil or temple .
the whole temple was a splendour of symbolism .
a consecrated mirror , about four feet in length , was placed to reflect the light of supreme grace , as a model for soul - making .
in one of what he calls ' humble supplications towards the true path ' ( suddha sanmarga satya chiru vinnappam ) he prays :
lord of all , supreme effulgent grace !
grant that henceforth our minds are not tainted with ritualistic and other aberrations of creeds and sects , cultural and other aberrations of castes and codes .
during this period ramalinga wrote also what he calls petitions to the supreme light in prose .
the circulars which he now and again issued to the fellowship enunciate the tenets of the path .
the instructions to the house , dated 30 march 1871 , carries the following :
should one ' s body break under the pressure of one ' s deeds and the impact of time , the body should not be burnt .
one must be confident in one ' s faith and in the full belief that the dead will rise .
one should not give way to grief and lamentation .
should a man lose his wife , let him not think of mairying another .
should one ' s sons die , let one not grieve .
let the people who have suffered the loss gather together on a day and give free gift of food to whom they can .
. . . but what was it that actually raised me ?
. . . it was compassion which one may call grace .
. . . one attains that compassion by a sense of universal unity .
when you develop further , he will let you know more .
for a while , after me , none will be forthcoming to counsel you .
for that reason do not continue on the path of indifference .
one notes here , as in many of his poems , the single driving purpose of his lifethe regeneration and divinisation of man .
the climax of ramalinga ' s dissatisfaction with the running of the sabhai or temple was reached in his deciding to close it down in 1873 .
within six months of its opening he had issued , on 18 july 1872 , written instructions on the manner of running it .
closing the sabhai , he kept the key with him in siddhi vilakam .
the temple remained closed until four years after his passing away when the fellows of the brotherhood opened it again and recommenced worshipping there in 1878 .
after the closing of the sabhai came the great sermon at siddhi vilakam on 22 october 1873 .
this marked the end of his outward activities .
as if in token of this , in the next month , november 1873 , he removed the lighted lamp from his room , and placed it outside .
he told his followers ( as has been recorded ) : ' without hindrance you may worship here .
i shall be closing the door of my room .
for some time the lord will shine in this flame .
they walked lound the room .
parvathipuiam : a village of 1,189 inhabitants , lying twenty - three miles south - west of cuddalore on the vndaachalam road .
the place is connected with one ramalinga paradesi , a somewhat cuuous example of a latter - day saint who has been almost deified by his followers .
even brahmins are said to have been buried in this belief , and people who died in other villages were in several cases brought to vadalur and interred there .
he resumed speech in the last days of january 1874 and reiterated his prophecies - hereinafter narrated .
on the 30th of that month , at mettukuppam , we saw our master for the last time . . .
he left with a promise to reappear some day , but would give us no intimation as to the time , place , or circumstances .
until then , however , he said that would be working not in india alone , but also in europe and america and other countries . . .
this prophecy has , in my opinion , just been literally fulfilled .
from bombay , the headquarters of the society was shifted to madras in 1882 . author .
likewise , the upanishads declare that soul - realization is born of the knowledge of the soul ( atma - vidya ) .
ramalinga ' s conception of the supreme light can be traced to the gayatri of rig veda .
in 1867 ramalinga met sabapathy sivacharya , a young man of nineteen , at chidambaram .
( tr : max muller ) the same thought is expressed pithily in taittiriya upani - shad ( iii , 10 - 14 ) :
he who dwells in man , and he who dwells in the sun are one .
the gayatri mantra takes further significance from the following verse from isavasyopanishad ( verse 16 ) :
within the limits of my knowledge , i do not know of any saint or prophet who is as great a poet as ramalinga .
such is the magic of his words , the enchantment of his utterance .
the saint is altogether of a different and more spacious mould .
in the u . s . constitution , the fundamental rights were expressed in absolute terms .
the supreme court of the united states had to find out and identity the legitimate restrictions on fundamental rights .
our founding fathers , however , decided to incorporate the restrictions within the relevant provisions themselves .
directive principles the directive principles of state policy inspired by the irish precedent , are a unique feature of our constitution .
most of the socio - economic rights of the people have been included under this head .
they are in the nature of ideals set by the founding fathers before the state and all the organs of the state must strive to achieve them .
to cross the seas in those days was for the hindu much more than a mere adventurous voyage .
dwarkanath went to england twice , in 1842 and again in 1844 .
the well - known orientalist , friedrich max miiller , was then a young student in paris , studying the rig veda under prof . burnouf .
dwarkanath did not return home from his second visit to europe .
he left behind three sons of whom the eldest was debendra - nath , father of the poet .
in his own way debendranath was even more remarkable than his fabulous father .
his personality left a deep impact on the intellectual development of rabindranath .
but not for long , for the crisis came early and suddenly , when he was only eighteen .
out of curiosity i picked it up but found 1 could understand nothing of what was written on it . "
therefore find your enjoyment in renunciation ; do not covet what belongs to others . "
this came as a revelation to the young devotee groping in the dark .
" my faith in god took deep root ; in lieu of worldly pleasures i tasted divine joy . . .
this crisis showed the mettle the son was made of .
i wanted to renounce the world and the world left me of its own accord .
what a singular coincidence ! "
it took him many years of judicious management and frugal living to pay off all the compounded debts .
the teacher enjoyed her burden and the pupil was entranced with so lovely a teacher .
not having any store of book learning to offer her , i took the first opportunity to tell her that i could write poetry .
she asked the poet to give her a special name , and i chose one for her which she thought very beautiful .
i wanted that name to be entwined with the music of my verse , and i enshrined it in a poem which i made for her .
there is an example of how well girls know how to show their appreciation by some pleasant exaggeration .
his heart was heavy as the ship moved , for bombay had been sweet in the company of his charming young teacher .
he was leaving behind all that had enriched his life so far .
he regretted later that he ever wrote them .
" a turkish bath is like having one ' s body laundered by a dhobi . "
his brother ' s family were in brighton and there he was happy and felt at home .
" the first thing the headmaster said after scanning my features was : " what a splendid head you have ! "
so a peremptory order went from india that rabindra was to cut short his studies and return with his brother .
" the light of my country , the sky of my country , had been silently calling me . "
on the other hand , it must have been a painful wrench to break away from the new and sweet attachments he had formed abroad .
" mrs scott took me by the hand and wept .
' why did you come to us , she said , ' if you must go so soon ? "
his friend and companion since boyhood is a girl called murala who is deeply in love with him .
i want nothing , and yet i keep on longing for what ?
whence this wound when no one ever hurt me ? "
he sees a beautiful and wayward girl and thinks he is in love with her .
disapointed poet wanders away .
when he returns and finds murala on her death - bed he realises that it is she he has always loved .
he had . discovered his form and could write as he pleased , unfettered by any examples of the past .
" at last , " said his heart , " what i write is my own . "
before , i would have held this to be a crime but now i felt no compunction .
freedom first breaks the law and then makes laws which bring it , under true self - rule . "
the public reception was gratifying .
it was obvious that a new star had arisen .
the uncle seems to have readily complied whether wholly out of altruism or because he too had left his heart behind , he has not told us .
" i went to him in fear and trembling .
he must have seen in this return of mine the blessing of divine providence . "
from mussoorie he went to where his brother jyotirindra nath and his wife were staying in a villa on the ganges at chandernagore .
there he spent some very happy days " those ineffable days and nights , languid with joy , and with longing . "
nothing in the outside world seemed trivial any more .
and it seemed an endless wonder .
as he put it , the poem " gushed forth and coursed on like a veritable cascade . "
suddenly the sun ' s rays penetrated the frozen gloom , , melting the snow .
so he accompanied his brother and sister - in - law to darjeeling which commands the view of the magnificent kinchinjunga peak , the next highest to mt .
" but the victory was with that little house in sudder street .
where then was the beauty that had so recently ravished his heart ?
what was its secret ?
when it was first published two friends of the author laid a wager as to its real meaning .
once again the great emptiness rolls over and brahma ' s eyes are closed in meditation .
but already the fates were laying a snare for him and the days of irresponsible and overflowing happiness were numbered .
but before he could do so the wild horse must be properly broken and harnessed .
and so a silent edict was issued that the family must look for a suitable bride for the young man .
the maharshi , progressive in religious matters , was conservative in the observance of social forms .
the choice was necessarily limited to a few families belonging to the same pirali sub - caste in the small provincial town of jessore .
obviously , here the connotation of ' secular ' was ' non - religious ' or pertaining to matters other than purely religious .
the forty - second constitutional amendment act which added the word secular did not attempt to define it .
there is no hereditary ruler and the head of the state is elected by the people for a fixed term .
he is usually called the president of the republic .
a republican form of government is democratic republic may , therefore , broadly mean a state with an elected head and a government by the representatives of the people .
in fact , it was the commonwealth which was transformed .
in this positive connotation , liberty would mean freedom of the individual to do what one likes .
leaders of the french revolution believed that all men were equal in the eyes of law .
whether it protected or punished , it must do so without any regard to distinction of birth etc .
' equality ' in political science terms does not mean that all men ( and women ) are equal in all circumstances .
there are bound to be physical , mental and economic differences .
finally , the reorganization of states under the constitution ( seventh amendment ) act , 1956 abolished the distinction between part a and part b states .
subsequently , several new states were formed , e . g . haryana , himachal pradesh , nagaland , manipur , mizoram , arunachal pradesh , goa .
as a member of the united nations also the name was india and all international agreements were entered in that name .
both the names , therefore , had strong votaries .
finally , the name ' india , that is bharat ' was adopted as a happy compromise .
the latest addition was that of the state of sikkim by the 35th and 36th constitutional amendments in 1974 and 1975 .
this was done at the request of the sikkim assembly and on approval of the people of sikkim through a referendum .
it can increase or decrease the area of any state and can also alter the boundaries or even the name of any state .
there is thus no guarantee of the territorial integrity or continued existence of any state .
( in re berubari union and exchange of enclaves , air 1950 sc 845 , 857 ) .
it has , therefore , been aptly said that india is an indestructible union of destructible states .
citizenship brings certain rights , duties , privileges and obligations .
all public offices are open to a citizen .
this relationship is regulated by national law and recognized by international law .
26 november 1949 the constituent assembly adopted the constitution and at once brought into force articles 5 to 9 relating to citizenship .
until then , those of us who lived in british india were under the crown and as such british subjects .
the partition of india and massive migrations created stupendous problems for citizenship determination .
even then , the constitution only laid down the law in regard to who would be citizens of india at the time of the commencement of the constitution .
it did not provide for the mode of acquisition and termination of citizenship .
article 11 said that parliament could regulate the right of citizenship by law .
domicile : domicile is an important criterion for citizenship of any country .
raza v . state of bombay , air 1966 sc 1436 ) .
domicile by birth or residence as a foresaid can be changed by a person .
in fact , citizenship is denoted by domicile and not vice - versa .
the constitution avoids dual citizenship ; there is one citizenship related to the domicile in the territory of whole of india and not in a part of it .
there is no separate state citizenship as in the u . s . a .
the domicile which he has is only one domicile , namely , domicile in the territory of india .
( pradeep jain v . union of india , air 1984 sc 1420 , 1984 3 scc 654 ) .
thus article 8 takes care of the future citizenship needs of all indians residing abroad .
in other words , it means that the right of citizenship cannot be taken away from a citizen except through express parliamentary legislation .
( ebrahim wazir v . state of bombay , air 1954 sc 229 ) .
( state of maharashtra v . prabhakar , air 1966 sc 424 ; sunil batra v . delhi administration , air 1978 sc 1675 ) .
for some time , there were sharp differences on whether corporations were also covered as legal persons .
the citizenship act , however made it clear that corporations were not citizens .
( state trading corporation v . commercial tax officer , ( 1964 ) 4 scr 99 ; tata engineering and locomotive co .
v . bihar ( 1964 ) 6 scr 885 ) .
parliament accordingly passed the citizenship act , 1955 providing for the acquisition and termination of citizenship .
thus , all matters relating to the citizenship rights , after the commencement of the constitution are to be dealt with in accordance with its provisions .
the amendment made the acquisition of indian citizenship more stringent .
by virtue of this power , parliament passed the public employment ( requirement as to residence ) act , 1957 .
and , this condition may refer not only to the numerical inadequacy of representation in the services but also the qualitative one .
constitution is a living organism of functioning institutions .
it keeps constantly growing , evolving .
constitutional law constitutional law would normally cover and connote the fundamental law of the land as contained in the provisions of the constitution .

secondly , a person accused of an offence need not make any statement against his will .
clause 3 of article 20 , however only gives a privilege to the accused person which may be waived by him if he so likes .

this right is available to the citizens as well as non - citizens .
in the famous gopalan case , ' personal liberty ' was held to mean only liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual .
freedom not to attend religions instruction article 28 forbids totally any religious instruction being imparted in educational institutions wholly maintained by state funds .
constitutionalism the concept of constitutionalism is that of a polity governed by or under a constitution that ordains essentially limited government and rule of law .
now , it may be that in the process of dynamic movement certain existing relationships are altered , varied or affected .
it is a fallacy to think that under our constitution there are only rights and no duties .
population for this purpose means the population as ascertained at the 1971 census .
there was to be no change in the number of seats in lok sabha until the year 2000 ( article 81 ( 3 ) ) .
seats are reserved for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in lok sabha statewise on the basis of population ratios .
originally , the reservation was for ten years but it is being extended every time for the next ten years ( articles 330 and 334 ) .
the raison d ' etre of representative democracy is that the government should obtain the mandate of the people periodically in order to continue in office legitimately .
the term of the house in india is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting .
the expiration of the period of five years operates as its dissolution .
the house may be dissolved before the expiration of its full term under certain circumstances .
it would be seen that there is no separate mention of pensions in the provision .
parliament has , however sanctioned to members a pension under the members of parliament ( salaries , allowances and pension ) act .
a bill passed by the two houses during the ninth lok sabha period inter alia provided for a pension after only a year ' s service as a member .
this , however , was not assented to by the president .
officers of the houses the constitution provides for a speaker and a deputy speaker for the lok sabha and a chairman and a deputy chairman for the rajya sabha .
the vice - president of india is the ex - officio chairman of rajya sabha .
a deputy chairman is chosen by the house from among its own members .
a similar provision exists for the deputy chairman rajya sabha in article 90 .
sessions of parliament
it is for the president to summon each house of parliament from time to time .
but article 85 ( 1 ) provides that six months must not intervene between two sessions .
he may return a bill , if it is not a money bill , to the houses for reconsideration .
this is termed the annual financial statement or the budget .
in its legal sense it means an exemption from some duty , burden , attendance or liability to which others are subject .
the privileges , in practice , give rise to certain powers , immunities and exemptions .
the most important of parliamentary privileges is that of freedom of speech while performing parliamentary duties .
under article 19 , the right of free speech is subject to reasonable restrictions , for instance , the law of libel .
every high court shall consist of a chief justice and such other judges as the president may deem necessary to appoint from time to time ( article 216 ) .
every high court has full control over its staff .
the salaries and allowances of the judges and of the high court staff are all charged on the consolidated fund of the state .
the jurisdiction of a high court may be extended to or excluded from a union territory ( article 230 ) .

also , the governor cannot be a member of parliament or of any of the state legislatures .
the governor cannot hold any other office of profit .
the present salary of a governor has been fixed by parliament by law as rs .
the term of the legislative assembly shall be five years .
the council , however , also has a chairman and deputy chairman elected by the council ( articles 178 - 187 ) .
the legislature of a state may make laws for the whole or any part of the state .
laws made by parliament , however , cannot be questioned on grounds of extraterritorial operation ( article 245 ) .
in the threefold distribution of legislative powers , residuary powers of legislation have been left with the union ( article 248 ) .
the maximum duration of validity of such laws will be six months after the expiry of the emergency .
the remedy otherwise could be only political .
a matter like the satisfaction of the president is beyond the court .

the first official language commission was appointed in 1955 .
democracy and representative institutions were , however , by no means entirely new to india .
complicated and serious matters were often referred to a special committee elected from among the members of the assembly .
it would , however , be wrong to presume that the british institutions as such were at any stage transplanted in india .
the parliament of india and the parliamentary institutions as we know them today had an organic growth on the indian soil .
even though some power of nominating members was retained , each house was to have an elected majority .
members were to be elected directly by constituencies delimited by the rules framed under the act .
the electoral qualifications prescribed varied widely and were based on communal affiliation and residence and property credentials .
the detailed classification of subjects into ' central ' and ' provincial ' was carried out .
shortcomings of the 1919 act : the act of 1919 had many shortcomings .
it did not fulfill the demand for responsible government .
the governor , dominated .
in the absence of the power of the purse , the ministers could not effectively implement their policy .
government of india act , 1919 : the reforms act of 1919 as supplemented by rules made under it , introduced many important changes in the indian constitutional system .
the first council of state had a total of 60 members , of whom 34 were elected , 20 were nominated officials and 6 nominated non - officials .
the first legislative assembly , constituted under the 1919 act , came into being in 1921 .
the total electorate for the council in 1920 was only 17,644 and for the assembly 904,746 .
the ; normal term of the council was five years , and that of the assembly three .
the governor - general could dissolve either house before the expiration of its full term .
he could also extend their normal life in special circumstances .
the to houses had coordinate powers , except that only the assembly could grant or withhold supply .
the swaraj party achieved remarkable success at the polls in 1923 .
by winning 45 seats out of a total of 145 , the swaraj party became the biggest party in the central legislature .
according to maulana azad , the biggest victory of the party lay in the fact that it secured even those seats which were reserved for the muslims .
during this period considerable political consciousness developed in the country .
in november 1927 , two years before it was due , the appointment of a commission was announced .
but , the commission ' s chairman , sir john simon , and all its members were chosen from the british parliament .
also , the ministers were not collectively responsible to the legislature .
the congress and indian opinion remained unreconciled and pressed for further reforms to make the administration more representative , responsible and responsive .
but , what came were the special legislative proposals for repressive measures known as the rowlatt bills .
satyagraha , non - cooperation and khilafat movements for swaraj under gandhiji ' s leadership followed .
after the rejection of the demand for a dominion status , the 1929 lahore session of the congress adopted a resolution on purna swaraj or complete independence .
the all - white simon commission was boycotted by most of the indian parties .
the report of the commission published in may 1930 was rejected by all political parties .
the indian national congress presided over by jawaharlal nehru at its lahore session in 1929 had already declared complete independence or puma swaraj as its aim .
the government of india act , 1935 : the act of 1935 aimed at providing a federal structure .
he was empowered in his " discretion " to preside at meetings of the council of ministers .
the council of state was to be a permament body not subject to dissolution , but one - third of its members were to retire every third year .
even an act assented to by the governor - general could be disallowed by his majesty .
the governor - general could remit a bill to the houses for reconsideration .
in order to be useful , it has to be tamed and harnessed .
the people need an institution , an instrumentality for expressing and exercising their sovereign powers .
and , the parliament becomes the people ' s institution par excellence through which the sovereign will of the people finds expression .
modern democracy has of necessity , to be a representative democracy where people exercise their sovereign power through their elected representatives .
it is the pivot on which the political system of the country revolves .
he can prorogue the two houses of parliament and dissolve the lok sabha .
his decision , in this matter is final .
rajya sabha : the rajya sabha is , as its name indicates , the council of states .
the different states of the union have not been given equal representation in the rajya sabha .
under the constitution , the rajya sabha consists of not more than 250 members .
round table conferences and the white paper : finally , the government decided to hold a round table conference in london in november 1930 to consider constitutional reforms .
it was followed by two more such conferences .
after three round table conferences , the british government published a white paper in march 1933 .
the scheme contained provisions for a federal set - up and provincial autonomy .
it proposed dyarchy at the centre and responsible governments in the provinces .
the british parliament constituted a joint committee of the two houses to further consider the government ' s scheme formulated in the white paper .
the joint committee with lord linlithgo as its chairman had conservative members in majority .
representatives of british india and of the princely states were invited to give evidence before the committee as witnesses .
the joint committee submitted its report in november 1934 .
on the basis of the report , a bill was prepared which was introduced in the british parliament on december 19 , 1934 .
parliament and the executive the term ' executive ' is often used rather loosely to connote several different things .
as such , the president is only the formal constitutional or nominal executive .
the ministers constitute the government of india and the head of the government is the prime minister .
the executive power of every state is required to be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by the parliament .
even in the spheres exclusively reserved for the states , the parliament is authorised to legislate under certain circumstances .
till the round table conference of 1930 india was a completely unitary state and whatever powers the provinces had were given to them by the centre .
it finally sought to break up the unitary system under which british india had hitherto been administered .
the principle of the constitution of 1919 had been decentralisation rather than federation .
provinces were free in normal circumstances from central control , in that field .
the act separated burma from india and two new provinces of orissa and sind were created .
the provinces in other words were invested with ' a separate legal personality ' .
it can be done by ah act of parliament , if the legislative assembly of the state passes a resolution to that effect by a special majority .
last but not the least , the parliament exercises its control over the states through the office of the governor .
the president , as we know , is a constituent of the parliament and at the same time the executive head of the union .
governors of the states are appointed by him and they hold their office during the pleasure of the president .
all this , however , does not imply that the states in india have been intended to be made merely administrative agents of the union .
one is not subordinate to the other in its own field .
the scheme of provincial autonomy envisaged by the act provided for an executive and a legislature in every province .
the council of ministers was to be responsible to the legislature which could remove it by passing a vote of no - confidence .
the legislature could exercise some control over the administration through questions and supplementaries .
nearly 80 per cent of the demands for grants could not however be assented to or rejected by the legislature .
the federal part of the constitutional scheme under the government of india act , 1935 was most impractical .
elections for the provincial legislatures under the government of india act , 1935 were held in february , 1937 .
the congress once again won a resounding success at the polls .
in all , the congress captured 715 out of the 836 general seats .
in 1973 , in the kesavananda bharati v . state of kerala 21 case the supreme court reviewed the decision in golak nath ' s case .
the law declared in golak nath ' s case was accordingly overruled .
the muslim league showed up badly even in the seats reserved for muslims and in muslim majority provinces .
in fact , it could capture only 51 of the 482 muslim seats .
in assam and north - west frontier province , it emerged as the largest party .
in punjab , the unionist party obtained clear majority .
several minor groups emerged in bengal and sind .
the government of india act , 1935 occupies a very important and permanent position in the constitutional history of india .
the act had endeavoured to give a written constitution to the country .
after centuries , the indians got an opportunity for assuming some responsibility in running the administration of their country .
justice ramaswamy said :
the conditions of service and tenure of office of the members of the commission , cannot be changed to their disadvantage after the appointment .
the chief election commissioner cannot be removed from his office except through a process of impeachment as in the case of a judge of the supreme court .
other election commissioners cannot be removed from office without the recommendation of the chief election commissioner .
usually the district collectors or deputy commissioners are designated as the district election officers .
they appoint presiding and polling officers for the polling stations .
the high court is empowered to declare the election of a returned candidate void on any of the grounds mentioned above , if proved .
popular ministeries were formed in the provinces by elected representatives responsible to the legislatures .
words like premier and ministers were used for the first time and recognition was given to the precedence of the premier .
the ministers too discharged their duties with great ability , impartiality and dedication .
even the british administrators were surprised and influenced by the display of administrative ability and acumen by indian ministers .
towards independence ( 1942 - 1947 ) the popular ministries lasted only two years .
all the congress ministries resigned in 1939 in protest .
in 1940 the muslim league passed its pakistan resolution .
cabinet minister sir stafford cripps was accordingly sent in march 1942 .
its proposals were turned down by all the political parties .
there are , however , many occasions when the house decides to dispense with the lunch break and even sits late hours .
arrangement of business and list of business parliamentary business can be divided into two broad headings viz . government business and private members ' business .
when the automatic vote recorder is out of order or when seats or division numbers have not been assigned , the method of distribution of slips is used .
members are supplied at their seats with ' ayes ' / ' noes ' printed slips for recording their votes .
members who desire to record ' abstention ' may fill in the abstention slip printed separately in yellow both in english and hindi .
the result so arrived at is announced by the chair .
normally , no restrictions are imposed on reporting the proceedings of the house .
no action is , however , taken if the criticism is fair and bonafide .
from december 1991 the question hour in the two houses , after necessary editing , was being telecast on the following day .
the broadcasting of the question hour started in 1992 .
bills passed by both the houses and sent to the president for assent do not lapse on dissolution of the lok sabha .
bills returned by the president for reconsideration do not lapse and can be reconsidered by the successive house .
however , the provinces were to have an option to accept or walk out of the new constitution .
quit india movement : the congress working committee passed a resolution at wardha in july , 1942 demanding the withdrawal of the british from india .
it was adopted by the all india congress committee at bombay on 8 august , 1942 .
in his speech before the committee , gandhiji declared that it was a decision .
arrest of congress leaders was followed by a country - wide agitation .
wavell plan : meanwhile , lord wavell replaced lord linlithgow as viceroy .
the war portfolio was to continue with the commander - in - chief , but that of external affairs was to be under the charge of an indian member .
where in doubt , the speaker usually acts in favour of giving an opportunity to the house to express itself . .
he is a part of the house , drawing his powers from the house for the better functioning of the house .
he is in the ultimate analysis , a servant of the house and not its master .
he receives documents , petitions , messages addressed to the house and all orders of the house are executed through him .
usually , the speaker takes the chair in the forenoon particularly during the question hour and the most crucial period following soon after the question hour .
simla conference : the viceroy convened a conference of indian leaders at simla .
the conference was held from 25 june to 14 july 1945 .
elections and cabinet mission : elections to the central legislative assembly in india which were overdue were held in the last quarter of 1945 .
elections to the provincial assemblies were completed by april 1946 .
in the remaining three provinces , the congress was the second largest party .
occasionally the deputy speaker may reserve a matter for a ruling by the speaker or may consult him before giving a decision .
also , the office of the deputy speaker is usually filled by a member of the opposition .
the office of the deputy speaker , deputy president as it was known till 1947 , is as old as the central legislature itself .
listed below are the names of the persons ( with the year of election ) who occupied the office of the deputy speaker .
pre - independence 1 .
sachidanand sinha ( 3 february 1921 )
sir jamsetjee jajeebhoy ( 21 september 1921 )
diwan bahadur t . rangachariar ( 4 february 1924 )
sir muhammad yagub ( 30 january 1927 )
sanmukham chetty ( 19 january 1931 )
abdul matin chaudhuri ( 21 march 1934 )
akhil chandra dutta ( 5 february 1936 )
sir mohammad yamin khan ( 5 february 1946 ) post - independence 1 .
ananthasayanam ayyangar ( 30 may 1952 ? 8 may 1956 )
david jones and paul eggleton has been collecting and studying these insects in rainforests across the globe to try and find out .
historic collections
the museum is well placed to do this research , as we have the largest collection of tropical termites in the world .
termites are busy workers .
paul ' s soil team has been collecting soil samples from different deforested areas in order to identify and count the termite species left there .
how do scientists use our historic collections for reference ?
they have been using the museum ' s comprehensive termite collection as a reference .
it contains more than 80 per cent of all the known termite species .
a chairman may , however , reserve major issues for decision by the speaker .
he attends the meetings of his party and is usually an active member of his party .
the speaker invariably chooses members on the panel of chairmen from both the ruling as well as the opposition parties !
the selection is entirely in the hands of the speaker but he may consult the leaders of political parties in the house before making his choice .
the secretary - general the third important officer of the house is the secretary - general .
he is the adviser to the speaker , to the house and to the members on all parliamentary functions and activities and all matters of procedure and practice .
the secretary - general discharges in his own right many legislative , administrative and executive functions and renders services and provides facilities to the members .
he is the overall incharge of the watch and ward organisation and the security in the precincts of the parliament estate .
the parliament library , research , reference , documentation and information services also function under him .
he is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings and properties of the parliament .
as the overall head of the parliamentary museum and archives , he is the custodian of the heritage of parliament and the keeper of all parliamentary records and archives .
he provides secretarial assistance and staff to all the parliamentary committees and is available to them for advice .
his role is that of a friend , philosopher and guide to the members and the committees .
members of the various political parties approach him for advice .
to a very large extent he has to maintain the same role of impartiality and objectivity as that observed by the speaker .
he must be wide awake and a man of quick decisions .
he is absolutely non - partisan and objective in his approach and perspective .
he is chosen from amongst those who have made their mark in the service of the parliament in various capacities in the secretariat of the house .
the speaker is the authority to choose and appoint him .
he is not subject to criticism in the house and his actions are not discussed either inside or outside the house .
he accompanies parliamentary delegations abroad and attends to numerous other activities of the parliament .
it is , however , the discretion of the speaker to put questions for oral or written answers as he thinks proper . "
the maximum number of questions in the unstarred list for a day is 230 in the lok sabha .
in the rajya sabha there is no such limit but normally the number of unstarred questions listed for a day is less than 200 .
he rises in his place and asks his question just by reading its number in the list and not the text of the question as such .
thereafter , the minister replies to the question .
no debate is permitted during the question hour on any question or answer given .
however , supplementary or follow - up questions may be allowed to be asked for the purpose of elucidating any matter of fact regarding an answer already given .
the member in whose name the question stands is entitled to ask two supplementaries .
the member giving notice of such a question has to give brief reasons for asking the question with a shorter notice .
if the minister agrees to reply to a short notice question , it is fixed on a day indicated by him .
only one such question can be placed on the list of questions for a particular day .
the conditions of admissibility of short notice questions are the same as for ordinary questions for oral answers .
( a ) the matter must be definite .
( b ) it should have a factual basis .
similarly , shortage of transport vehicles , cases of kidnapping , dacoity , explosions , communal tensions have been held not to be appropriate matters for such motion .
the subject matter of the motion must have a direct or indirect relation to the conduct or default on the part of the government of india .
interim government : the first interim national government was announced on august 24 , 1946 .
it included pandit jawaharlal nehru , sardar vallabhbhai patel , dr .
rajendra prasad , asaf ali , sarat chandra bose , dr .
john mathai , sir shafat ahmed khan , jagjivan ram , sardar baldev singh , syed ali zaheer , c . rajagopalachari and dr .
technically , they were all members of the viceroy ' s executive council and the viceroy continued to be the head of the council .
he and eleven of his colleagues took the oath of office on september 2 , 1946 .
the door was kept open for the entry of the muslim league even at a later date .
on the other hand , if the motion is passed , it amounts to censuring the government .
since the adoption of an adjournment motion involves an element of censure against the government , the rajya sabha does not make use of this procedure .
it has been seen that the adjournment motion is used very sparingly .
of these 80 notices on four subjects were admitted . in the ninth lok sabha , of the 375 notices , nine on eight subjects were discussed .
calling attention notices the provision for the calling attention notices was first made in the year 1954 .
prior to this , the need for a precise procedure to raise an important and urgent issue was being felt considerably .
it was a matter which could not have been raised under any other rule .
by the end of october , the viceroy somehow succeeded in bringing in the league .
the government was reconstituted on october 26 .
thus the league became a partner in the government .
mountbatten plan : in march 1947 , lord louis mount - batten was sent as the new viceroy to arrange for a smooth transfer of power .
he reached india on 22 march 1947 .
these resolutions , if admitted , are put down in the private members ' list of business .
when called upon by the chair , the member concerned moves the resolution and makes a speech thereon .
other members and the minister concerned also speak thereafter .
allocation of time for discussion of private members ' resolutions is done by the committee on private members ' bills and resolutions .
generally , two hours are allotted for discussion on these resolutions .
the mover of the resolution has got a right of reply after the minister ' s speech .
government resolutions : resolutions moved by the ministers are known as government resolutions .
ministers also are required to give prior notice to the secretary - general of their intention to move a resolution .
it is in the discretion of the government to find time and to fix a date for its discussion .
besides , they provide a variety of social services like housing , education , health and employment to the people .
needless to say , governments need money to discharge these functions .
where is this money to come from ?
who is to sanction the funds ?
the necessary funds are mobilised from the country ' s resources by way of taxes , loans , etc . to meet governmental expenditures .
in respect of schemes already sanctioned in the main budget no discussion on any question of principle or policy is allowed .
general grievances cannot be ventilated during discussion on a supplementary grant .
a member can only point out whether the supplementary demand is necessary or not .
beyond this , at this stage , there is no scope for general discussion or for ventilation of grievances .
on the basis of their content , the bills can further be classified into :
( i ) original bills embodying new proposals , ideas and policies ; ( ii )
bills to replace ordinances issued by the president ;
in such a case , leave of the house to introduce the bill is not necessary .
in other words , the bill does not have to go through the introduction stage .
the second reading or the consideration stage consists of two steps which may be called as the first stage and the second stage .
reference to committee : a bill may be referred to a select committee or a joint committee .
the members of the select committee are drawn from among the members of the house where the bill has originated .
the chairman of the joint committee is appointed by the presiding officer of the house in which the bill was introduced .
the bill again passes through the committee stage and the bill as reported , is presented to the house .
each clause is placed before the house separately for discussion .
immediately after a clause is placed before the house , amendments thereto can be moved subject to the conditions of admissibility .
amendments , if accepted , become a part of the bill .
in other respects , the stages through which a bill passes are the same as in the case of a government bill .
as a result , the state has become more and more an instrument of social and economic change .
the congress adopted a resolution at its lucknow session in april 1936 .
this demand was firmly reiterated by the all india national convention of congress legislators held in delhi in march , 1937 .
during august - october 1937 , the central legislative assembly and the provincial assemblies of each of the provinces where the congress held office , adopted resolutions .
he declared that the only way out to arrive at a just solution of communal and other problems was a constituent assembly .
as far as possible , different parties and groups are represented on parliamentary committees in proportion to their respective strengths in the house ( s ) .
a committee has the power to take oral or written evidence .
sub - committees may also be appointed by the main committee to examine matters referred to them .
the report of the subcommittee is submitted to the main committee .
there are no public hearings .
when a committee is deliberating , a member can speak more than once on a question under consideration .
all questions are determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting .
in case of an equal division of votes on any matter , the chairman has a second or casting vote .
they can frame their own internal rules of procedure subject to the approval of the speaker .
but by virtue of their constitution and authority behind them , no minister or official can disregard or ignore them .
the estimates committee : the estimates committee consists of 30 members of the lok sabha .
unlike the public accounts committee and the committee on public undertakings , the members of the rajya sabha are not associated with it .
the constituent assembly thus became a body , it was believed , fully representative of the states and provinces in india and fully sovereign of all external authority .
the constituent assembly duly opened on the appointed day monday , the ninth day of december , 1946 at eleven in the morning .
the historic objectives resolution was moved in the constituent assembly by nehru , on 13 december 1946 , after it had been in session for some days .
the beautifully worded draft of the objectives resolution cast the horo - scope , so to say , of the sovereign democratic republic that india was to be .
thus , the resolution gave to the assembly its guiding principles and the philosophy that was to permeate its tasks of constitution - making .
it was finally adopted by the assembly on 22 january 1947 .
framing the constitution the assembly appointed a number of committees to deal with different aspects of the problem of framing the constitution .
these included the union constitution committee , union powers committee , committees on fundamental rights , minorities , etc .
it possesses a rich collection of rare books , art books , etc .
the earliest printed book available dates back to 1671 .
from time to time , and on specific occasions , the parliament library organises book exhibitions on themes of interest .
the reference and documentation division has been fully equipped to handle inter alia references received from members of parliament .
data relating to some parliamentary activities contained in the parlis database are also available on request to state legislatures .
the documentation service brings out a fortnightly periodical , parliamentary documentation .
these press clippings are kept in a chronological sequence in separate folders and can be consulted or referred to by members in the library .
also their attitudes have to be oriented to the needs and responsibilities and the tenor and temper of parliamentary democracy .
a parliamentary official has no concern with the political affiliations or the ideologies of the members .
as a servant of the house , a parliamentary official must treat all members as equal .
in order to perform his duties , the official has to be an expert in his line of work .
speed and accuracy in the disposal of work are thus the key ingredients in the operational dynamics of parliamentary officials .
some of the guiding norms may be summed up as follows : -
a special committee was constituted to go through them along with the recommendations of the drafting committee thereon .
the suggestions made by the special committee were again considered by the drafting committee and certain amendments were picked up for incorporation .
which was submitted to the president of the assembly on 26 october 1948 .
while introducing the draft constitution in the assembly for consideration on 4 november 1948 , dr .
he observed : one likes to ask whether there can be anything new in a constitution framed at this hour in the history of the world .
more than hundred years have rolled over when thefirst written constitution was drafted .
it has been followed by many countries reducing their constitutions to writing .
similarly what are the fundamentals of a constitution are recognised all over the world .
given these facts , all constitutions in their main provisions must look similar .
in a democracy nothing can be sadder and cause for greater concern than the erosion in the respect for the representatives .
the visiting committees also witness proceedings of legislature committees when the latter take evidence .
for some years now , a symposium on a subject of topical interest is also held on the last day of the presiding officers ' conference .
in response to these requests an autonomous body called the ' indian parliamentary group ' was set up .
its membership is open to members of parliament .
former members of parliament may become associate members .
the speaker , lok sabha is the ex officio president and the deputy speaker , lok sabha and deputy chairman , rajya sabha are the ex officio vice presidents .
the secretary - general , lok sabha is the ex officio secretary of the indian parliamentary group .
the group functions as the national group of the inter - parliamentary union and as the india branch of the commonwealth parliamentary association .
the constituent assembly accomplished the tremendous task of framing the constitution in less than three years .
adoption of the constitution was , however , not the journey ' s end .
the chairman of the drafting committee , dr .
ambedkar , and the president of the assembly , dr .
rajendra prasad , speaking on 25 and 26 november 1949 sounded words of warning and wisdom .
dr .
the constitution was finally signed by members of the constituent assembly on 24 january 1950 - the last day of the assembly .
our founding fathers were some of the most distinguished and the wisest of men and women - great jurists , patriots and freedom fighters .
the union meets in conference twice a year to be hosted by member countries .
the association meets in conference annually and also assists in holding seminars on parliamentary practice and procedure at regional levels .
from the very beginning of its membership of the ipu and the cpa , india has been taking considerable interest in the working of these institutions .
besides , a number of international regional seminars have been organised in india from time to time .
the constituent assembly of india met in this hall ( 1946 - 49 ) .
the historic transfer of power from british to indian hands also took place in this hall in 1947 .
the hall is adorned with portraits of national leaders .
four committee rooms on the first floor are used for meetings of parliamentary committees .
three other rooms on the same floor are used by the press correspondents who come to the press galleries of the lok sabha and rajya sabha .
a large part of the stacking is outside the parliament house .
several passages of noble words are inscribed on the parliament building , which are expected to inspire the deliberations in the two houses .
at the very entrance , a sanskrit quotation from the upanishads reminds one of the sovereignty of the nation of which the parliament is the visible symbol .
a spacious lounge has been laid out around the water pool .
telephone exchange , telecom bureau , post office , super bazar are also housed in the basement .
on the terrace floor are situated the bureau of parliamentary studies and training and the staff library .
the ground floor is considered to be one of the most functionally viable areas ideally suited for national and international conferences .
all the five committee rooms are provided with a simultaneous interpretation system as is available in the lok sabha and the rajya sabha chambers in the parliament house .
the pool is the central feature in this area .
the same instrument is used as an intercom and for making external calls .
the visitors are accompanied by a staff member who guides and briefs them .
in such cases , the bureau of parliamentary studies and training may hold introductory briefing sessions before the tours .
various studies have shown that esperanto is useful as a preparation for learning other languages .
it has also been recommended as a core element in courses in language awareness .
the esperanto community is almost unique as a worldwide community whose members are universally bilingual or multilingual .
language rights
in the esperanto community , however , language diversity is experienced as a constant and indispensable source of enrichment .
consequently every language , like every biological species , is inherently valuable and worthy of protection and support .
we maintain that exclusive reliance on national languages inevitably puts up barriers to the freedoms of expression , communication and association .
we are a movement for human emancipation .
prague , july 1996
the india , into which chidambaram ramalinga swamioal was born , was in the throes of political awakening and cultural regeneration .
the institutions continued by us after independence and / or embodied in the constitution were those which had grown and developed on the indian soil itself .
thus the constitution did not represent a complete break with the colonial past .
the constitution acquired newer and newer meanings by the manner in which and the men by whom it was worked from time to time .
the story continues .
the constitution of india is unique in many ways .
it has several special features that distinguish it from other constitutions of the world .
the next morning it transpired that the priest had left tiruvottriyur two days previously .
ramalinga took a handful of sand from the sea - shore and put it into her hand .
size of the constitution in sheer physical terms , it is the lengthiest constitution ever given to any nation .
it is a very comprehensive document and includes many matters which could legitimately be the subject matters of ordinary legislation or administrative action .
also , the constitution - makers did not want to leave certain matters subject to doubts , difficulties and controversies to be handled by future legislation .
the united states where in addition to the federal constitution , each state had its own separate constitution .
besides , our constitution contains a description of several directive principles of state policy and fundamental duties of citizens .
types of constitution written or unwritten : constitutions may be written like the u . s . constitution or unwritten and based on conventions like the british .
our constitution is written even though conventions also play a part in so far as they are in keeping with the provisions of the constitution .
the bride was the daughter of his sister unnamulai ammai , called dhanammal .
her age at the time of marriage is not known .
does he refer to this when , in several poems , he mentions his dread of seeing the fading of his mother ' s brow ?
in a characteristic trembling confession , he rcfers to his celibacy in his poem ptllai - peruvinnappam ( a son ' s supplication ) :
was it my past deed chasing me ?
was it your grace that guarded me ?
this was published by palayam subbaraya chettiar in 1854 for the society for religious education .
this was published by ayyasami mudaliar in 1855 .
it is note - worthy that this publication was for free distribution .
ramalmga settled the name as ' thondamandalam ' in an exposition as logical and rigorous as any academician might desiie , and in a manner worthy of an epigraphist .
he concluded his thesis with the following words :
they may satisfy themselves by looking into the stone inscriptions in the temples in tiruvahdayam , tirumullaivayil and other shrines .
it is to be added that the stone inscriptions in these places bear the name of the region spelt ' thondamandalam ' .
the third book edited by ramalinga was chmmaya deepikai ( guide to spirituality ) of the poet mutthaiyyaswamigal of vrid - dhachalam .
this was published by madurai mudaliar m 1857 .
the second prose - work of ramalinga , jivakarunya ozhuk - kam ( the law of compassion for life ) was published only after his passing away .
this book they called tiru arut pa ( holy book of grace ) .
however a considerable number of poems were still left out . spent the days mostly outside the city , returning home only at night .
he records in a poem , written long after he left madras :
an apparent paradox ( or what will appear so to non - hindu minds ) may be stated and clarified here .
then he returned to the worship of lord siva of chidambaram .
in the presence of lord nataraja ( siva ) in chidambaram he recalled :
it may be that , in the higher reaches , different laws operate .
it contained the following :
people must realize that they must hasten to bring to fruition the rare chance of human birth given to them .
the fact that vegetarianism exists on a considerable scale in tamil nadu to - day is largely owing to ramalinga swamigal .
the book was printed by ' asiatic press , 292 , lingee chetty street , madras ' , financed by somasundara chettiar of mylapore .
ramalinga wrote in reply , ' it goes against my inclination to be paraded as ramalingaswami .
it seems to me that the epithet is pompous and , as such , to be avoided . '
( in tamil the words lend themselves to this interpretation also ) .
tozhuvur velayuda mudahar , in his statement to the theosophical society , described ramalmga in english as follows :
towaids the end he let his han grow long ; and what is rather unusual with yogis , he wore shoes .
his gaiments consisted but of two pieces of white cloth .
his habits weie excessively abstemious .
he was known to hardly ever take any rest .
a strict vegetarian , he ate but once in two or three days , and was then satisfied with a few mouthfuls of rice .
a fascinating face , strangely haunting , eyes beaming with compassion and grace .
he shunned indulgence in clothing :
in the early years he ate twice a day .
later it was reduced to once in two or three days , and only a few mouthfuls at a time .
he addresses god as ' you who banished sleep for me ' .
he says he is apprehensive of sleeping :
i loathe the slothful sleep that comes night or day .
he banishes sleep :
was it entanglement in the world ?
you monkey mind , you foolish idiot , get away !
stop playing pranks here that you play with others !
one day , the mouth of the pot having broken , muthiyalammal wanted to change it .
then she left the house for the next village .
when muthiyalammal returned the next morning , she found ramalinga absorbed in writing , and the lamp burning .
she discovered his mistake which , without any conscious volition on his part , had resulted in this miracle .
one could fill pages with miracles attributed to him by legend , but it will be wearisome .
the judge asked the ascetic , ' who hit you ? '
' yes , ' said the ascetic , ' the man who brought me here hit me with a stone . '
the judge understood that no better clari - fication would be available from the ascetic .
then , on his own , he gave the proper sentence to the man who had hit the ascetic .
during his stay in cuddalore , ramalinga had a chance encounter with a leader of brahmo samaj .
the debate was noted down by nayana reddiar of alappakkam who stated that it was a verbatim record of the debate .
this was published under the same title by sanmarga mitnnelra kazhaham ( society for the propagation of the true path ) in 1893 .
on 16 january 1867 , ramalinga was present at a festival in tiruppapuliyur , near cuddalore , on the bank of the river pannai .
the local people had been exposed to his speeches before .
some among the crowd turned to naicker and said , ' please let us have your view , and kindly establish it . '
he said he preferred that the matter be settled between him and ramalinga by correspondence .
drawn out , naicker declared , ' to worship an idol seems idle and childish .
this has the sanction of the vedas and the great utterances , ' said ramalinga .
naicker was silent .
' is there nothing which can be perceived by the mind , that cannot be perceived by the senses ? '
' you must tell me , ' said ramalinga .
' in that sense , the senses can convey bliss to the mind , ' said ramalinga .
' the bliss conveyed through the eyes , through the ears and other senses have been recognised by our sages .
he told them ( in words that have been recorded ) : ' i opened my shop .
now i am in this body .
soon all bodies shall be mine . '
i shall remain shut in the room for ten to fifteen days .
he will not reveal me .

ambedkar said in the constituent assembly that by parliamentary democracy we mean ' one man , one vote ' .
it would be held unconstitutional and invalid unless it is covered by any of the restrictions spelled out again in the constitution itself .
thus , the constitution also lays down the machinery and mechanism for the enforcement of fundamental rights .
later he installed such mirrors in the vadalur hall as well as in the siddhi vilakam house .
the katha upanishad says that in the embodied self brahman can be perceived distinctly as an image in a mirror .
a hostile habitat
at temperatures of 2c , without sunlight , and at immense pressure , the deep sea is an alien environment to us .
we might have expected only a few species to be able to live there .
how do so many different species survive in such a hostile environment ?
constant environments tend to lead towards a small number of dominant species , where diversity is low .
how do scientists use and test theories to discover knowledge about the natural world ?
in brief , ramalinga was the harbinger of the modern tamil renaissance , of which the neoteric voice was subramanya bharati .
a parallel may be drawn between the ramalinga - bharati pair and the gandhi - nehru or the ramakrishna - vivekananda .
the quality of ramalinga ' s poetry is well described in the tribute that his foremost pupil , thozhuvur velayuda mudaliar , paid him ( in tamil ) :
by the middle of the 8th century , after a long period of political unrest and religious and social chaos , bengal was consolidated as a powerful hindu kingdom .
however , one of the five brahmins was named daksha and is reputed to be an ancestor of the tagores .
history is full of ironies .
many hindus were converted to islam , some by force , some lured by greed to share the power of the new masters .
you have therefore violated your fast . "
pir ali khan said nothing , but having been born a hindu the words rankled in his mind .
having lost the " purity " of caste the family found it difficult to live in a community which gave it little quarter .
the predicament was particularly galling when it came to finding suitable husbands for the daughters .
he would be a bold brahmin who accepted the daughter of such a family .
jagannath kushari had to pay a heavy price for this temerity , for he too was obliged to leave his home .
it was a descendant in the male line of this bold and rash man who is said to have founded the tagore family .
his name was panchanan kushari .
exile and social persecution had made the descendants defiant and adventurous .
unheard - of things were happening in the country .
govindpur was at that time a small fishing village whose inhabitants were all of the so - called low caste .
panchanan was always addressed by them as panchanan thakur , as the brahmins are often addressed even to this day .
he had found a lucrative occupation in supplying provisions to the foreign ships that sailed up the river .
its fortunes were from the beginning linked with the rise of the british power in india .
the family fortune reached its peak in the life and career of dwarkanath tagore , the grandfather of poet rabindranath .
born in 1794 , dwarkanath was only thirteen years old when his father died .
handsome , versatile and enterprising , he was a romantic figure who in an earlier age would probably have carved out a kingdom for himself and become a prince .
prince , however , he came to be called because of his magnificent way of living and his large public charities .
his extensive business covered many fields , indigo factories , saltpetre , sugar , tea , coalmines , etc .
no less lavish and extravagant were his charities .
fundamental duties the 42nd amendment to the constitution inter alia added a new part to the constitution under the head fundamental duties .
independent judiciary the constitution of india establishes an independent judiciary .
unlike the u . s . , we do not have separate federal and state court systems .
the word of the supreme court is the final law of the land .
from his sick bed amal watches the procession of life in the street outside and longs to participate in it .
the village postman jokingly assures him that he will bring him a letter from the king .
death brings deliverance and innocent faith its final reward .
but the child rabi was more robust than amal and survived the neglect of his parents and the tyranny of the servants .
thus did the rain patter and the leaves quiver again and again , the livelong day in my consciousness . "
the supreme court also functions as the arbiter of any disputes in regard to jurisdiction and distribution of powers between the states or between the union and the states .
conclusion the constitution of india is a most comprehensive document .
it is unique in many ways .
it cannot be fitted in any particular mould or model .
it is a blend of the rigid and the flexible , federal and unitary and presidential and parliamentary .
also , it presents a via media between the principles of parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy .
this itself is evidence of its resilience , dynamism and growth potential .
a tutor had been engaged to teach him elementary reading and writing at home but the arrangement came to a premature end .
the child had his way but it did not take him long to discover that no truer prophecy was ever uttered .
the first school he thus went to was known as the oriental seminary .
my only consolation is that i had not the power of venting these barbarities on any sentient creature . "
the day ' s routing was well packed with lessons .
he was wakened up while it was still dark and made to practise wrestling with a celebrated one - eyed professional wrestler .
at seven in the morning the mathematic tutor came and , slate in hand , the boy had to work out problems in arithmetic , algebra and geometry .
sometimes there would be a lesson in natural science illustrated with simple experiments , followed by lessons in bengali and sanskrit .
the offer was never repeated .
he would save not only food bills but doctor s bills also . "
when the child complied and brought the verses the next day he was made to recite them before the whole class .
" the only praiseworthy thing about this moral poem was that it soon got lost , " recalled the author .
" its moral effect on the class was far from moral .
he was summoned by his father who asked him if he would like to accompany him to the himalayas .
the next few days were spent in excitement .
for the first time a full suit of clothes was ordered for him , including a gold embroidered velvet cap .
and so one day , thus handsomely attired , the boy accompanied his father on the first great adventure of his life .
its history is almost coeval with that of rabindranath .
but the maharshi did not blame or chide the boy .
this early " training in reverence for other religions helped to broaden the child ' s sympathies which were later to attain such wide dimensions .
by the time father and son reached the foot of thehimalayas it was april .
their destination was dalhousie , at that time a snjall cluster of bungalows over 7,000 ft . above the sea .
justice is further defined as social , economic and political .
the words used in the preamble of our constitution are some of the noblest .
they embody the highest values that human ingenuity and experience have been able to devise thus far .
the servants ' regime was at an end .
she was only a little older than rabi who longed to be her playmate .
" i circled round her at a safe distance , but i did not dare go near . "
the unwelcome intruder had suddenly become an interesting visitor .
the bengali tutor soon discovered an effective way of dealing with the truant pupil .
thus the whole play was rendered into bengali versethe budding poet ' s first tribute to the great english dramatist .
dramas were written and acted inside the house and music was in the air .
like other progressive movements of bengal of that period , this too had been sponsored by the tagore family .
in february 1876 , young rabi , aged fourteen , recited a patriotic poem at this annual festival .
the poem was published in the amrita bazar patrika , then an anglo - bengali weekly .
this was not only rabi ' s first public appearance but also the first occasion when his name appeared in print over his poem .
the earlier supreme court opinion regarding the preamble not being a part of the constitution , perhaps needed reconsideration .
it was felt that attention should be paid to the intention of the framers of the constitution as expressed through the preamble .
justice sikri said that the legislative history of the preamble to the constitution justified its importance .
thus under the warmth of affection and encouragement , the fountain of ' rabi ' s poetic exuberance was released .
the father dies and she is left an orphan , disconsolate .
a young traveller passes by and struck by her loveliness and her plight takes her home with him and marries her .
the waves like a mother ' s arms take back the child to its bosom .
its aim was the political liberation of india and was modelled after mazzini ' s carbonari .
at the same time a terrible famine raged over the land and numberless skeletons haunted the countryside .
this ghastly contrast was the theme of a satirical poem written by rabi and read on the occasion of the hindu mela of that year .
like everything else he put his hand to , this magazine blazed a new trail in bengali literature .
young rabi had now a family forum at his disposal , though he needed little incentive to scribble .
no forma were evolved , there was only the distraction of movement , a bubbling up , a bursting back into froth . "
however , it is too late .
nalini dies and the poet is left to philosophise on universal love .
bhanusimha thakurer padavali bears witness to the impact of vaishnav religious poetry on this boy poet .
although the basic elements were not precisely defined , those mentioned in the preamble were specifically included .
first asserted in the berubari case ,
during the emergency , the forty - second constitution amendment act of 1976 added to the preamble the words ' socialist ' and ' secular ' .
also , ' unity of the nation ' was amended to read ' unity and integrity of the nation ' .
the only place from where the residence of sovereignty and the source of the constitution itself can be ascertained is the preamble .
the words ' we the people ' remind us of the opening words of the preamble of the u . s . constitution .
it was sought to be stressed that we were one nation and had one constitution and one polity .
the union can override the states in national interest during emergencies .
even during normal times it can invade the states ' sphere by legislating on subjects in the state list under article 249 .
but , our founding fathers at the very outset provided for the indestructibility of the union and for states having no right to secede from the union .
each time species are eradicated from an area of the seabed , species from neighbouring patches recolonise it .
this constant change means that species on the seabed rarely become dominant in one area .
being so hard to study , theories about the seabed are hard to test .
however , the mosaic theory is currently the best theory by which ocean scientists can explain the patterns of life they find on the seabed .
huge plant diversity
coral reefs , pine savannas , lowland rainforests and dripping cloud forests are just a few of the different environments in the mesoamerica region .
convention on biodiversity
the convention on biological diversity , developed after the rio earth summit in 1992 , aims to preserve our precious biological diversity .
it puts an obligation on national governments to protect their region ' s natural resources .
in the kesavananda bharti and minerva mills cases , secularism came to be mentioned as a basic feature .
also , it was inherent in the guarantee of freedom of religion as a fundamental right .
however , before the bill was enacted as the 44th amendment , the list of basic features was dropped .
the preamble itself even in its original unamended form contained the concept of liberty inter alia that of belief , - faith and worship .
in this case , both legal and political sovereignty could be said to vest in the people .
also , matters of legislation and state administration grew more and more complex .
all forms of direct democracy , therefore , soon became practically extinct from all over the world .
there may be a few referenda on very major international issues in some places .
modern democracy thus has of necessity to be indirect representative democracy whereunder government is carried on and laws are made by the elected representatives of the people .
founding fathers like nehru and ambedkar were quite clear in their minds that political justice was meaningless without economic justice .
dr .
liberty derived from the latin word ' liber ' .
it meant absence of restraint on freedom of trade and enter - prize , equality of opportunity in trade and business , freedom of contract and competition .
article 17 as a fundamental right was directed at abolishing the practice of untouchability which was an affront to human dignity .
unity and integrity of the nation in order to safeguard the dignity of the individual , we need to build the nation and protect its unity and integrity .
it was only through a spirit of common brotherhood and fraternity that we could hope to build national unity in a highly pluralistic and heterogenous society .
if this does not happen , nation building becomes an impossibility .
other parts and provisions of the constitution are only an elaboration and an attempt to give concrete shape , content and meaning to the words of the preamble .

constitution of a country lays down the basic structure of the political system under which its people are to be governed .
in a democracy , sovereignty vests in the people .
but , with the growing complexities of administration and the size of the nation - states , direct democracy is no more feasible .
in the modern representative democracies , people exercise their inalienable right to decide how and by whom they should be governed .
clauses 3 and 4 of article 15 embody exceptions to the general principles of non - discrimination .
maulana abul kalam azad and pandit jawaharlal nehru at a session of the constituent assembly .
it observed that these areas were instances of socially and educationally backward - class citizens .
it held that reservation for 80 per cent of the state ' s population which was in ' rural areas ' could not be a homogenous class by itself .
chanchala v . mysore , air 1971 sc 1762 ) .
it declared that more than 50 per cent reservation of posts in a single year would be unconstitutional as it per se destroyed article 16 ( 1 ) .
the mandal commission had in its report recommended 27 per cent reservation for backward classes in view of the limit of 50 per cent imposed by the supreme court .
reservations may also not be advisable in higher posts like those of professors in education , pilots in airlines , scientists and technicians in nuclear and space application etc .
abolition of untouchability article 17 abolishes and forbids its practice in any form .
if practised , it shall be treated as an offence punishable in accordance with law .
( people ' s union for democratic rights v . union of india , air 1982 sc 1473 ) .
most importantly , it is the bounden duty of every citizen to ensure that untouchability is not practised in any form .
abolition of titles article 18 prohibits the state to confer titles on anybody , whether an indian citizen or a foreign national .
an exemption has however been made in the case of military and academic distinctions .
under clause 2 of the article , a citizen of india has also been prohibited from accepting any title from a foreign state .
under stay orders from the supreme court , no awards were announced for several years .
( state of w . bengal v . subodh gopal bose , air 1954 sc 92 , 95 ) .
this enumeration of the freedoms has however been held to be not exhaustive by the courts for the full enjoyment of the democratic values of a free citizen .
steve followed up this idea , and discovered a way to track historical climate changes by studying midges .
tracking climate change
larvae of non - biting midges live in fresh water .
when they die , they fall to the bottom of the lake and become part of its sediment .
each different species of midge thrives at a particular temperature .
so , the number and type of midge can indicate what the temperature was at that point in history .
malaria causes between one and three million deaths per year in the subtropics .
in order to control the spread of malaria , we need to control the mosquitoes .
limited companies having shareholders own a large number of industries .
there are creditors and depositors and various other persons having dealings with the undertakings .
protection in respect of conviction for offences under article 20 , the constitution has taken care to safeguard the rights of persons accused of crimes .
thus the legislature is prohibited to make criminal laws having retrospective effect .
the ramakrishna mission in bengal had to declare that it is not hindu at all but represented an independent minority religion .
at last a consensus was found which each of the contenders interpreted in his own way .
the consensus was embodied in articles 31 and 19 ( f ) of the constitution .
rights in order to be meaningful must be enforceable and backed by remedies in case of violation .
the supreme court may issue writs in the nature of habeas corpus , mandamus , prohibition , quo warranto and certiorari .
parliament may empower any other courts also to exercise these powers .
the right guaranteed by article 32 cannot be suspended except as provided by the constitution .
even at the time of framing the constitution , dr .
ambedkar had described this provision as the very soul and heart of the constitution .
only the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution can be enforced under article 32 .
article 226 grants powers to the high courts also to issue various writs .
part iv , articles 36 - 51 the directive principles of state policy embodied in part iv are a unique feature of our constitution .
while seeking to protect the basic rights of the individual , the framers of the constitution also wanted it to become an effective instrument for social revolution .
every other right can be shown to be a usurpation hardly worth fighting for .
gandhiji sought to emphasise the economic and social responsibilities of all citizens .
in fact , right from the first lok sabha , strictly viewed , every house has been dissolved before completing its full term .
members of parliament qualification for membership : article 83 lays down the qualifications for membership of the two houses of parliament .
additional qualifications may be prescribed by law .
every provision of the constitution has to be so construed as to give meaning and relevance to every word used .
( golak nath v . state of punjab , air 1967 sc 1643 ) .
to understand any constitution in existence and operation , therefore , it is essential to know its background and history .
it may also assent to a demand subject to a reduction in the amount asked for .
every demand for grant must receive the prior recommendation of the president ( article 113 ) .
no amendment is permitted which seeks to vary the amount or alter the allocation of any grant head or vary the amount of any charged expenditure .
appropriation bill is necessary because no money can be drawn from the consolidated fund without parliamentary sanction through an appropriation act .
parliament may by law regulate the procedure for the purpose of timely completion of the financial business , ( article 119 ) .
language in parliament hindi and english have been declared by the constitution to be the languages for conducting business in parliament .
it does not and cannot itself govern .
the council of ministers may in a sense be described as the grand executive committee of parliament charged with the responsibility of governance on behalf of the parent body .
there is , however , a clear distinction between the functions of the executive and the functions of parliament ( article 75 ) .
the executive is to govern , albeit on behalf of parliament and the people .
the function of parliament is to exercise political and financial control over the executive and to ensure parliamentary surveillance of administration .
the law made under the provision may specify the jurisdiction and powers of the tribunals .
if an act of parliament is set aside by the judiciary , parliament can re - enact it after removing the defects for which it was set aside .
several writ petitions challenging the validity and constitutionality of the 1985 enactment were also filed in the supreme court and various high courts .
the supreme court , on the request of the government , withdrew and transferred to itself all the writ petitions pending before various high courts .
the speaker disqualified four of the 20 members on the ground of voluntarily disobeying their party whip .
however , the disqualification was to have only prospective effect from the date of the order .
he suggested that the task of determining disqualification of members under the tenth schedule could better be entrusted to the judges .
it would be necessary to define a political party and to lay down conditions for its recognition for purposes of the anti - defection law .
recovery of damages against the government of india cannot be claimed by a state before the supreme court under article 131 .
also , the supreme court may transfer cases from one high court to another in the interests of justice .
it is a unique feature of our constitution that in principle , any individual can straightaway approach the highest court in case of violation of his fundamental rights .
the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court extends to civil , criminal and constitutional matters .
judges may be transferred from one high court to another by the president after consulting the chief justice of india ( article 222 ) .
the president may appoint an acting chief justice for a high court .
also , in case of need , the president may appoint additional and acting judges of the high court for a period not exceeding two years .
in the context of these developments , the drafting committee decided in favour of describing india as a union , although its constitution might be federal in structure .
parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of india .
after a finance commission has been constituted , presidential order in regard to distribution of proceeds from income tax etc .
article 290 a provides for certain sums to be paid annually to devaswom funds of travancore and tamil nadu from the consolidated funds of these states .
a state may also similarly borrow subject to limits set by law by the state legislature .
government of india , within its borrowing powers , may make loans to any state or give guarantees in respect of loans raised by the state .
so long as any of such loans remain outstanding , the state government may not raise any further loans without consent of government of india ( article 293 ) .
things of value within territorial waters or continental shelf and resources of the exclusive economic zone shall vest in the union ( article 297 ) .
this article obviously is an independent or additional source of executive power outside article 245 .
during the periods of emergency , extraordinary powers were assumed by the union government under several laws and constitutional amendments passed by parliament .
there was widespread criticism of the misuse of powers during the period of internal emergency .
in the general elections that followed , the ruling congress ( i ) under the leadership of indira gandhi lost and a janata party government was formed .
thus , exercise of president ' s power under article 356 was brought under judicial review to that extent .
the 1963 act similarly provided for a hindi translation of state acts etc .
they believed that parliament had no power to revoke the mandate to build a welfare state and an egalitarian society ( para 682 ) .
the secular character of the state could not , likewise , be done away with ( para 1437 ) .
but there is a negative side also .
these two institutions were differentiated from each other in their status and functions .
ideally , the powers of the monarch were limited by the will of the people and the customs , usages and injunctions of dharmasastn - . .
charter act , 1853 : jthe last of the charter acts , the charter act of 1853 made important changes in the governor - general ' s council .
at the same time , the council was enlarged for legislative purposes by the addition of six special members who were styled as " legislative councillors " .
similarly , the number of additional members in the provincial legislative councils was also increased .
the entry of the ' elected ' members marked the beginning of new era in the life of the council .
the governor - general also continued to have the power to promulgate ordinances for the peace and good government of british india in case of emergency .
nevertheless , with the constitution of a legislature , the making of laws ceased to be the business of the governor - general ' s council .
a tremendous increase in the scope of legislative activity was witnessed and several measures of permanent benefit to the country were enacted .
lok sabha : the other house ? the lok sabha ? is the house of the people .
it is directly elected by the people .
in addition , the president may nominate not more than two members to represent the anglo - indian community .
the executive remains responsible and the administration accountable to parliament .
the function of parliament is to exercise political and financial control over the executive and to ensure parliamentary surveillance of administration .
parliament has the power to make laws regulating the constitution , organisation , jurisdiction and powers of the courts .
it was laid down in the constitution that the number of judges other than the chief justice , would diagram 1 not be more than seven .
parliament was , however , empowered to prescribe a larger number of judges by law .
thus , at present the number of judges of the supreme court , including the chief justice , is 26 .
there are many authorities who very legitimately interpret the constitution almost daily during the discharge of their functions .
and , the interpretation given by the supreme court becomes the law honoured by all courts of the land .
there is no appeal against the judgement of the supreme court .
thus , the parliament in india is not as supreme as the british parliament where no judicial review of legislation is permitted .
at the same time judiciary in india is not as supreme as in the united states of america which recognises virtually no limit on the scope of judicial review .
it embodies and epitomises the ' sovereign will ' of the people ; it is the mirror and the voice of the nation .
the parliament functions as the ' grand inquest and watchdog of the nation .
andhra pradesh 18 14 .
all these constitute a wealth of information which becomes immediately public and can be used to raise discussions in the house .
the most well - known and effective mechanism through which members on their own elicit information is that of asking questions in the houses of parliament .
debates and discussions bring out into the open the underlying tensions and resentments in society .
in performing this conflict resolution role , the parliamentary institution acts as a great national integrator and mediator in change .
this conflict resolution and integrational role of parliament is specially significant in the context of our highly pluralistic society .
it creates feelings of national integrity of a high order which no other forum can .
the election commission the election commission consists of the chief election commissioner and such other election commissioners as may be appointed by the president .
( f ) he is so disqualified on the ground of defection .
besides the above constitutional requirements , the election laws lay down some more disqualifications .
a government servant dismissed for corruption or for disloyalty to the state is disqualified for a period of five years from the date of his dismissal .
mode of election rajya sabha : members of the rajya sabha are the representatives of the people of the states and of union territories .
they are elected through a system of indirect election and in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote .
they notify the president ' s order in the gazette extraordinary and issue a press communique in the matter .
thereafter , the secretaries - general issue summons to members individually .
normally , the senior - most member is chosen .
the speaker pro tem presides over the house for the purpose of enabling the new members to take oath , etc . and elect their speaker .
the president also addresses the houses together at the commencement of the first session of each year .
he is then conducted in a ceremonial procession to the high - domed central hall of parliament along a red - carpeted route .
after the national anthem has been played , the president reads the printed address .
it contains a statement of policies and programmes the government proposes to pursue in the ensuing year and a review of its activities and achievements during the preceding year .
being a statement of policy of the government , the address is drafted by the government .
the scope of discussion on the address is very wide and any or all aspects of administration may be brought into focus .
members are free to speak on all sorts of national and international problems . '
even matters which are not specifically mentioned in the address may be covered through amendments to the motion of thanks .
at the end of the discussion , usually the prime minister replies to the debate on the president ' s address .
after the prime minister ' s reply , amendments are disposed of and the motion of thanks put to vote in the house .
after the motion is passed , it is conveyed to the president by the speaker through a letter .
the secretary - general , there after , sends a notice of this date to every member .
normally , the notice of motion for election of the candidate selected by the ruling party is given by the prime minister or the minister of parliamentary affairs .
on the day fixed for the election , the member in whose name a motion stands on the list of business is called upon to move it .
he also has the option to withdraw it .
voting procedure : decision of the house on any question can be taken only by means of a motion moved by a member .
however , the practice of going into the lobbies for the purpose of vote recording is not in vogue for many years now .
when a division is ordered by the speaker , division bells ring normally for three and a half minutes .
under the automatic vote recorder system , each member casts his vote from the seat allotted to him pressing the requisite button provided for the purpose .
within the house and in all matters connected with the house , his word is final .
independence and impartiality are the two important attributes of the office of the speaker .
he ranks higher than all cabinet ministers other than the prime minister himself .
his salary and allowances are charged on the consolidated fund of india ? that is , they do not have to to be voted by parliament .
his conduct cannot be discussed except on a substantive motion .
he does not vote in the house except when there is an equality of votes .
upon his election as speaker , he dissociates himself from the activities of his party .
he performs these functions , in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and the ' rules of procedure and conduct of business in the lok sabha ' .
his decision in all parliamentary matters is final .
in respect of matters not specifically provided for in the rules , the speaker has residuary powers to issue directions .
it is for the speaker to determine in what order members would speak and how long a member should be allowed to speak .
if he withholds his consent the matter does not proceed further .
the speaker has to be sensitive to the atmosphere in the house .
he communicates the decisions of the house to the authorities concerned and requires them to comply with the terms of such decisions .
all the parliamentary committees of the lok sabha are constituted by him or by the house .
they function under his control and direction .
committees like the business advisory committee , the general purposes committee and the rules committee work directly under his chairmanship .
he determines what matters are financial matters which fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the lok sabha .
if he certifies a bill to be a ' money bill ' , his decision is final .
it is a breach of privilege to reflect upon his impartiality , competence , character or conduct .
such intimation is also essential in the event of the release of the member .
he often leads these delegations himself .
the speaker is also the chairman of the conference of presiding officers of legislative bodies in india .
the lok sabha secretariat functions under the direction and control of the speaker .
such questions are rarely asked in the lok sabha , and for sessions together no such question may be asked .
similarly , no short notice question can be addressed to a private member .
in his notice , the member is required to specify the point ( s ) that he wishes to raise .
only one notice of the half - an - hour discussion is put down for a sitting .
the maximum time ever taken by the ' zero ' proceedings during the eighth lok sabha came to 32 minutes .
the result was that it very often continued beyond one full hour .
nobody knows what matter might crop up during this period or what kind of attack might be launched against the government .
the following , for example , are some of the subjects on which adjournment motions were admitted and discussed during the seventh lok sabha :
death of eight persons and the illness of several persons due to the consumption of illicit liquor in delhi and the serious situation arising out of it .
qutab minar tragedy taking a toll of 45 lives .
the discussion starts with the motion moved by the mover that the house do now adjourn . '
after the mover and the other members have spoken on the motion , the minister intervenes and at the end the mover has a right of reply .
before the year 1953 , there was no provision for such discussions except by way of motions and resolutions .
adjournment motion being in the nature of a censure motion could not be used quite often .
a convention , therefore , was established in 1953 whereby members could raise discussion on such matters for short duration .
for raising such discussion , a member has to give a notice to the secretary - general specifying the matter precisely and explaining clearly the reasons thereof .
such notice should also be signed by at least two other members of parliament .
the member moving the motion frames it in the form in which he wants it to be adopted by the house .
generally , government motions relate to obtaining approval of the house for some policy or action of the government .
motions moved by private members , on the other hand , generally tend to elicit the opinion or the feeling of the house on a matter .
it neither depends on nor arises out of another motion .
further , the constitution provides for the impeachment of persons in high authority which can be initiated on a substantive motion drawn in proper terms .
it is moved during the course of a debate and if accepted , the original question is put as amended .
notice of motion , like any other notice , is given to the secretary - general .
no period of notice for motions has been prescribed .
but there is a difference .
all resolutions come in the category of substantive motions , that is to say , every resolution is a particular type of motion .
further , all motions are not necessarily put to vote of the house , whereas all the resolutions are required to be voted upon .
types of resolutions resolutions may be classified as private members ' resolutions , government resolutions , and statutory resolutions .
a member who wants to move a resolution has to give notice to the secretary - general informing him of intention to move the same .
there is no hard and fast rule as to the question of resignation by a government .
no - confidence motion the council of ministers remains in office as long as it enjoys the confidence of the lok sabha .
in order to ascertain this confidence , the rules provide for moving a motion to this effect which is called a no - confidence motion .
this responsibility is collective .
a no - confidence motion need not set out grounds on which it is based , unlike a censure motion .
otherwise , it is taken that the member does not have the leave of the house .
a motion of no - confidence , once admitted , has to be taken up within ten days of the leave being granted .
the speaker , after ascertaining the views of the government , decides the date for the discussion .
if the government so desires , the discussion can even be taken up forthwith .
the time for the discussion is usually fixed on the recommendation of the business advisory committee .
after the members have spoken , usually the prime minister himself replies to the charges levelled against the government .
the mover has a right of reply .
the scheme underlying this statement recognised the inevitability of the partition of the country .
according to the statement , the constitution framed by the existing constituent assembly could not be forced on unwilling parts .
the net result and effect of the whole scheme , it was obvious , was to be the partition of india into india and pakistan .
the constituent assembly generally , the task of framing the constitution of a sovereign democratic nation is performed by a representative body of its people .
the budget is presented with a budget speech which is , in fact , one of the most important speeches in parliament .
a copy of the budget is laid on the table of the rajya sabha at the conclusion of the speech of the finance minister in the lok sabha .
soon after , the minister introduces the finance bill which contains the taxation proposals made by the government .
( b ) discussion on the budget : the parliament is primarily a deliberative body .
the passage of the budget is marked by deep and thorough discussions in both houses of the parliament .
the discussion on the budget starts after a few days of its presentation .
it gives members the necessary time to go through the text of the budget and to discuss the financial proposals among themselves .
budget is discussed in two stages ? the ' general discussion ' followed by a detailed ' discussion and voting on the demands for grants ' .
besides , opportunity for further discussion on financial proposals arises during consideration and passing of appropriation bill and the finance bill .
the general debate thus offers an occasion for each house to express its mood .
the government may also get an idea as to how a particular proposal will be taken at the subsequent stages .
it may be noted that the rajya sabha by virtue of its power , has no business with the budget beyond the general discussion .
( ii ) discussion on demands for grants : the next stage in the procedure is discussion and voting of demands for grants .
generally , separate demands are made for the grants proposed for each ministry .
during the discussion on demands which is , lively , the policy and the working of the ministry comes in for close scrutiny .
time is allotted to each ministry for discussing demands relating to that particular ministry .
the members can do so by moving a subsidiary motion to the main motion for demands for grants .
these subsidiary motions are called , in parliamentary parlance , cut motions .
the business advisory committee fixes a time limit for voting a particular demand and for all the demands for grants included in the budget .
this process is known as guillotine .
with this , the discussion on demands for grants is concluded .
the committees presented 48 reports on demands for grants for the year 1994 - 95 during the 1994 budget session .
the bill , as the name itself suggests , intends to give legal authority to the government to appropriate expenditure from and out of the consolidated fund .
after the bill is passed by the lok sabha , the speaker certifies it as a money bill and transmits it to the rajya sabha .
the latter house has no power to amend or reject the bill , but has to give its concurrence .
the bill , thereafter , is presented to the president for his assent .
discussion on the bill covers matters relating to general administration and local grievances within the sphere of responsibility of the union government .
while general criticism of the policy of the government is permitted , discussion on the details of particular estimates is not .
in short , the whole administration comes under review but questions which have already been discussed cannot be reopened .
vote on account in a democratic set - up , the government endeavours to provide the parliament full opportunity to discuss the budgetary provisions and the tax proposals .
it is necessary that the government should keep enough finance with it to run the administration of the country , until the demands are voted by the parliament .
as a convention , vote on account is treated as a formal matter and passed by the lok sabha without discussion .
vote on account is passed after the general discussion on the budget is over and before the discussion on demands for grants is taken up .
supplementary and excess demands for grants no expenditure in excess of the sums authorised by the parliament can be incurred without its sanction .
all cases involving such excesses are brought to the notice of the parliament by the comptroller and auditor general through his report on the appropriation accounts .
if other ministries or the state governments are also involved , their advice is obtained .
professionals and various interest groups such as business , labour , agriculture and industry , if considered necessary , are also consulted .
the bill is , then , examined in detail by the administrative machinery in consultation with all other authorities concerned and given a final shape .
when this has been done , the bill is ready to be brought before the house .
it can be introduced in either of the two houses by the minister concerned .
normally , copies of the bill are made available to the members at least two days before the date on which it is proposed to be introduced .
the three readings : a bill has to pass through different stages in the parliamen before it becomes an act .
each bill undergoes three readings in each house , i . e . first reading , second reading , and third reading .
( i ) first reading : it is necessary to ask for leave of the house to introduce a bill .
the question is put to vote of the house thereafter .
there being no restriction on the number of bills to be introduced on a particular day , a minister may introduce as many bills as he wants .
even before introduction , a bill can be published in the gazette with the permission of the speaker / chairman .
these are ad hoc committees which are appointed to consider particular bills referred to them .
amendpents can be moved to various clauses by members of the committee . "
the committee can also take evidence of experts , associations or public bodies who are interested in the measure .
procedure for consideration of a bill is the same as it is in the house .
it is not ordinarily permissible at this stage to move a motion for consideration of the bill .
if the president gives his assent , the bill becomes an act from the date of his assent .
special procedure regarding money bills a money bill cannot be introduced in the rajya sabha .
it can be introduced in the lok sabha only on the recommendation of the president .
the parliament may approve or disapprove ; of such resolution or it may not take any action thereon .
the purpose of focusing the attention of both the government and the public on the particular proposals contained in the bill is attained .
the government takes a policy decision on the subject of the bill and presents its views before the house .
under the rules of the lok sabha , not every committee consisting of members of parliament is a parliamentary committee suo motu .
as such , they are not parliamentary committees .
types of committees there are two types of parliamentary committees in india , viz . , ( i ) standing committees and ( ii ) ad hoc committees .
standing committees : standing committees in each house ( and certain joint committees ) may be categorised in terms of the nature of their functions as follows :
their recommendations are intended to tone up the administration for economic , efficient and speedy execution of these policies and programmes .
reports of these committees have earned for them considerable respect from all sections of the society ? both official and non - official .
the elaborate and effective procedure for follow - up of the recommendations made by these committees is essentially an indian innovation to the parliamentary procedures prevalent elsewhere .
all the three financial committees are elected by the house for one year .
ministers can neither become members of these committees , nor can they be asked to appear before them for the purpose of giving evidence .
their chairmen are nominated by the speaker .
this right is exercised through the mechanism of a committee on petitions .
each house of parliament has a committee on petitions .
in the lok sabha , the committee consists of 15 members , while in the rajya sabha , it has 10 members .
the function of the committee on petitions is to examine every petition which , after presentation to the house , stands referred to the committee .
the committee reports to the house on specific complaints made in the petitions after taking such evidence as it deems fit .
the committee suggests remedial measures , either on the specific case under review or in a general way to prevent such cases in future .
this committee has already made its mark in affording parliamentary support to the common man in the matter of redressal of his just grievances .
it has proved to be a real boon to those wronged and oppressed citizens for whom no remedy or relief is available elsewhere .
while the committee of the lok sabha consists of 15 members , the committee of the rajya sabha has 10 members .
the committee of each house consists of 15 members nominated by the speaker / chairman .
normally , the committee is reconstituted every year .
it also ensures the effective implementation of the constitutional safeguards for these backward communities .
these are the general purposes committee , the house committee , the library committee and the joint committee on salaries and allowances of members of parliament .
general purposes committee : in each house there is a general purposes committee .
the presiding officer of the concerned house is the ex officio chairman of the committee .
it advises the speaker on matters pertaining to the selection of books , framing of library rules and its future planning , etc .
it consists of ten members from lok sabha and five from rajya sabha .
committee reports instil fear and respect in the administration .
the 17 departmental committees cover the entire gamut of governmental activities .
more importantly , these new structures constitute significant improvements in the existing instrumentalities . for ensuring scrutiny of the government .
yet , as a representative body of the people , it is the trustee of their sovereignty .
in fact , the constitution of india itself has recognised this paramount need .
no legislation has been passed by the parliament so far , under clause 2 of art . 98 of the constitution .
similar rules in respect of the rajya sabha secretariat were framed and promulgated by the president in 1957 , in consultation with the chairman .
they do their own recruitments through competitive examinations .
the financial committee service for rendering secretarial assistance and attending to all works connected with the three financial committees and the railway convention committee ;
parliament library and information service the parliament of india may easily claim to have one of the best libraries with very efficient information service .
that each legislature requires efficient and adequate staff cannot be overemphasised .
they have to use all their competence , tact and experience in discharging their onerous responsibilities .
as far as advice to members is concerned , parliamentary officials are not expected to offer it gratuitously .
this respect is to the whole house and not to an individual occupying the chair .
the speaker represents the house to all outside bodies and authorities .
regard for the authority of the chair as the symbol of the corporate personality of the house , is the basic norm of parliamentary conduct .
when a member wants to speak he should rise in his place to attract the attention of the chair .
members of parliament are , therefore , expected to observe a certain standard of conduct not only inside the house but also outside it . f
there is nothing to be ashamed of in borrowing .
it involves no plagiarism .
nobody holds any patent rights in the fundamental ideas of a constitution .
the clause by clause consideration of the draft constitution was completed during 15 november 1948 - 17 october 1949 .
the drafting committee , thereafter , carried the consequential or necessary amendments , prepared the final draft and placed it before the assembly .
the second reading of the constitution was completed on 16 november 1949 and on the next day the assembly dr .
the parliament buildings comprise of the parliament house , parliament house annexe , reception office and the upcoming parliament library complex .
together called the parliament house estate , it includes extensive lawns , pools , fountains and roads .
the estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sand - stone wall and iron grills with massive iron gates .
the building has 12 gates , 5 with porches .
the aims that inspire the users of esperanto are still as important and relevant as ever .
while esperanto , like any language , is not perfect , it far outstrips other languages as a means of egalitarian communication on a world scale .
we maintain that language inequality gives rise to communicative inequality at all levels , including the international level .
all ethnic languages are bound to certain cultures and nations .
the child who learns esperanto learns about a world without borders , where every country is home .
we maintain that education in any language is bound to a certain view of the world .
in his manifesto , in his last years , for the fellowship that he founded , he declares :
tired out , he would often spend the night there , sleeping in the open .
he used to visit also tiruttanihai ( the shrine of muruga ) , tiruvahdayam and tirumullaivayil .
he gave discourses at the temple and composed songs in praise of the deity .
his elder brother , parasurama pillai , who was living there , died a few days after ramalinga ' s arrival .
as in madras , ramalinga spent only the nights at home , being out all day , walking with god , worshipping in temples and composing songs .
rigid or flexible : constitutions may be called rigid or flexible on the ground of the amending procedure being difficult or easy .
federal constitutions are usually classified as rigid because of their difficult amending processes .
during 51 years , there were as many as 83 amendments of our constitution .
federal or unitary : constitutions are also divided between federal and unitary .
the classic example of the first category again is the u . s . constitution and of the second the u . k . constitution .
also , there must be an independent supreme court as the arbiter of any disputes between the union and the states .
the disciples who took upon themselves this labour of devotion were velu mudaliar of pondicherry , sivananda mudaliar of selvarayapuram , and ratna mudaliar of irrukkam .
it is to ratna mudaliar that we are most indebted for the book .
for six years , from 1860 to 1866 , which is attested to by the correspondence between them , ratna mudaliar perserved .
otherwise , ramalinga wrote , he himself would take a similar vow .
at last , ratna mudaliar succeeded in collecting the poems and publishing the book in february 1867 .
no leeway shall i give you , none he emerged above the earthly plane to one of different dimensions where we , ordinary humans , may not follow him .
in describing ramalinga , one cannot better what huston smith has said of buddha :
to ramalinga ' s compassion we have devoted one full section already .
it seems to the present writer that human compassion reached its acme in ramalinga .
the open space was at the meeting of two highways , one from madras to kumbakonam , and the other from manjakuppam to vriddhachalam .
a thousand printed invitations were issued to the public .
it is stated that one thousand and six hundred people were fed daily for the first three years .
the feeding of the hungry and whoever calls there continues to - day .
the foremost tenet in ramalinga ' s religion was compassion for life .
the lord has flowed into me and i into him , past distincion we are one !
light the truth within them . guide them to the path of pure knowledge , and so to true bliss .
this hymn , composed in ahaval metre , consists of 1596 lines , a dimension not reached in that metre elsewhere in tamil poetry .
we have the date of its composition : 18 april 1872 .
they are a monarchy with a hereditary king while we are a republic with an elected president .
in the u . s . system , the supreme court with its power of judicial review and of interpreting the constitution has assumed supremacy .
in india , the constitution has arrived at a middle course .
both parliament and the supreme court are supreme in their respective spheres .
avail yourself of this , without wasting time .
the song " thinking , and again thinking of him " , will be suitable for prayer . '
this is dear from the song of his that he refers to , which was composed by him at this time :
this went on for three months .
ramalinga did away with all religious doctrines , dogmas , rituals and observances .
indeed , even in traditional hinduism , siva is cons dered to be pure efaulgent light .
the teachings of theosophy are the same as those of ramahnga .
the mundaka upanishad ( ii , 9 and 10 ) says :
in the supreme effulgent sheath rests the stainless , transcendental brahman .
that is pure , that is the light of all lights .
sri ramakrishna said , ' the bee buzzes round the flower only as long as it has not tasted the honey .
when they are lured to utterance , before or after , the result is not always poetry , or poetry of the highest order .
but the poet , in centra - distinction to the mystic , is lured by the demon of utterance into the expression of the inexpressible .
on the other hand , great poets , in the expression of their visions , do shape from their visions things of beauty that are a joy for ever .
the sayings of prophets do strike a note of poetry to a varying extent .
we recognize clearly the poetry of jesus and the poetry of buddha .
ramalinga is a unique exception .
there was hardly an institution or cause to which he did not give generously .
he was the first indian member and patron of the asiatic society of bengal founded in 1784 by sir william jones .
it was not only that he gave of his wealth generously and wisely . he stood up bravely , in the teeth of popular opposition .
" our food had nothing to do with delicacies .
a list of our articles of clothing would only invite the modern boy ' s scorn .
on no pretext did we wear socks or shoes till we had passed our tenth year .
in the cold weather a second cotton tunic sufficed .
it never entered our heads to consider ourselves ill - off for that reason .
the period of childhood and early boyhood which was spent under the tutelage of family servants was later dubbed by him as servocracy .
so the child remained rooted to the spot and dared not step out , though the servant had disappeared .
years later he was to recall this childhood companion :
it was as if nature shut her hands and laughingly asked , ' what have i got inside ? ' and nothing seemed impossible . "
the painful experience of a circumscribed childhood was also to survive as a lasting impression and to mould his ideal of education in later years .
the bengali boys could neither follow the words which were in english nor the tune which was unfamiliar .
all one had to do was to pour words into a fourteen syllable mould and they would condense into verse .
thus the child scribbled his first verse in the popular bengali metre , payar .
" the lotus of poetry blossomed in no time in this fourteen - syllabled form and even the bees found a foothold on it . "
the child was , however , disappointed .
was poetry no more than this amusing exercise ?
nevertheless the experience was intoxicating .
he got hold of a blue copy book in which he started scribbling his verses .
the maharshi was enchanted and sat down for his evening meditation under a pair of chhatim trees .
there the father and son spent the first few days of their journey .
the father , however , did not leave him entirely to his own resources .
he read with him select pieces from sanskrit , bengali and english literatures , and in the evening made him sit by his side and sing his favourite hymns .
at night when the indian sky revealed the splendour of the stars , he gave him lessons in astronomy .
the watch was wound with such zeal that it had to be sent to the watchmakers in calcutta for repair .
she herself was a genuine lover of literature and music and had a keen and sharp sensibility .
when bangadarsan came there was no midday nap for any one in the neighbourhood .
it was my good fortune not to have to snatch for it , for i had the gift of being an acceptable reader .
my sister - in - law would rather listen to my reading aloud than read for herself .
there were no electric fans then , but as i read i shared the benefits of her hand fan . "
the poet understood the poet while the theologians wrangled .
so he was brought to london and put in a lodging house facing the regent ' s park .
more than the cold , it was this dismal bleakness which chilled him to his bones .
this pretence of learning latin lasted for some time until rabindra changed his lodgings .
it was with some difficulty that he was persuaded to accept the fee .
during this period of his stay in london he visited the houses of parliament and heard gladstone and john bright speak on the irish home rule .
when he first arrived at the house , only the white - haired doctor , his wife and eldest daughter were there .
they returned only when they were assured that the stranger was harmless .
her devotion to her husband and family impressed him greatly .
she taught him several english and irish songs .
his reticence will continue to baffle his biographer .
there is the inevitable poet , young and dream - entranced , break -
ing others ' hearts and not knowing what he himself wants .
there are several other characters in the drama and they all manage to break each other ' s heart .
though the poem was not later included in his collected works , it did help to establish his reputation on its first appearance .
for such lyrical ease and romantic abandon were something new in bengali poetry .
but however painful the pang at parting , this " broken heart " on his return home was more carefree and happy than ever .
why should it not do , i thought to myself , to act a drama in a kind of recitative based on this idea ?
he tried it out in valmiki pratibha and was much encouraged by its stage success .
he himself took the part of valmiki and his young niece pratibha that of the little girl whom the robber chief rescued .
this too was successfully produced , rabindra himself in the role of the blind hermit .
the young poet was in love with sorrow and revelled in the bitter - sweet despair .
" what is it you are softly humming to yourself ?
he feels a strange kinship with her which he elaborates in the rest of the poem .
in another poem he sympathises with the plight of a falling star driven to its suicide .
in one poem he reproaches his sister - in - law for having left him behind .
" she is gonewhat more is there to say ?
they are gone - what song is left to sing ?
only the heart wails its monotonous chant : they are gone , they are gone , leaving behind a wrecked heart .
they are gone and with them are gone the flower and the bird and the light that brightens the day .
like a torn and soiled garment i am cast away . "
the spirit of evening which he invoked in the first poem , vague and mysterious , has now assumed a concrete and familiar image .
had the evening taught you its magic spell ?
you revealed my own hidden wealth to me , and without singing yourself , you taught me all the songs i know . "
the melancholy expressed in this sheaf of poems is naive and adolescent but by no means insincere or affected .
the permission came and in april 1881 he sailed for the second time to england , accompanied by a nephew .
the second voyage to england proved abortive .
his first full - fledged novel , bou - thakuranir hat ( the young queen ' s market ) , was also written here .
this first novel is a historical melodrama , cast in the mould which his predecessor bankim chandra chatterji had made very popular .
the prince is finally exiled .
on his way to the holy city of banaras he escorts his sister to her husband ' s kingdom .
on arriving there they learn that the husband had in the meanwhile taken another wife .
the disappointed sister accompanies her brother in the exile .
the place where they had moored their boat is still known as the young queen ' s market .
as a work of fiction in itself , the novel has little to recommend it .
nevertheless its historical importance in the author ' s development is considerable .
after this idyllic holiday in the villa on the ganges , the two brothers and kadambari devi returned to calcutta .
he has himself described it at length in his reminiscences and later in the religion of man .
" every year i have lived , i have died too . "
in the midst of the great emptiness , limitless , timeless and lightless , sits brahma the creator , his eyes closed in the stony silence of meditation .
suddenly the eyes open and he utters the primeval hymn of creation .
the emptiness is filled with burning nebulae and revolving globes of fire .
he will now proudly walk the earth and pity mankind for their folly .
he is frightened at the thought of his becoming human and flees from her .
when he returns , unable to keep away for long , he finds her dead .
" to me it was all like a living story " .
he was watching and absorbing and growing , and all the time the craftsman was practising new strokes and improving his technique .
not all the poems are pictures , however ; nor do they come within a single kind .
history has its ironies and thus this unromantic marriage was arranged for one of the most romantic men of the age .
despite the obvious anti - climax , he was , however , in the long run none the worse for the maharshi ' s arbitrary and seemingly unreasonable choice .
himself incorrigibly romantic , what he needed from a wife was not further stimulus but an antidote .
nalini was a name always dear to his heart and somehow mrinalini seemed to incorporate it .
as a matter of fact , he was at this time working on a prose drama of that name .
in the " end rabindranath had to complete the drama by himself .
but before it could be produced a tragedy overtook the family .
in april 1884 , kadambari devi , rabindranath ' s favourite sister - in - law , suddenly committed suicide .
she was only twenty - five then .
no one knows why she did so .
the hungry crowds riot outside the palace crying for bread .
" what is this noise ? " inquires the queen .
the coarse , clamorous crowd who howl unashamedly for food and disturb the sweet peace of the palace ! "
he leads his armies into kashmir to teach prince kumarasen a lesson .
none can withstand the fury of his onslaught , his armies are victorious everywhere and he occupies kashmir .
he therefore sends his severed head to the king as his offering .
the conflict in this play is between love and duty , between a vain and infatuated man and a proud and humane woman .
there he heard that satyendranath and his young friend loken palitwere planning a visit to england .
forthwith he made up his mind to accompany them .
in the course of all these wanderings and changes of abode , a small exercise book which was always with him was getting filled with poems .
whether he was gazing at the snow - capped himalayas or sweltering in the heat and dust of the plains , the poems poured forth .
the largest number were written in ghazipur , whether because of or in spite of the roses , it is hard to say .
in other words , it stood for a solemn commitment to religious freedom for all .
this was reinforced by the principles of equality of status and opportunity and of fraternity among all the people of india .
the vision of the founding fathers was that of a nation transcending all diversities of religion , caste and creed .
they were not hostile to religion but they hoped that it would be possible to forge political unity and that religious differences would not hamper nation building .
the constitution envisaged a new social order free from communal conflicts and based on justice , social , economic and political .
it visualized a polity under which laws would not discriminate between citizens on grounds of religion , caste or the like .
to fulfil their obligations , governments need to know about their country ' s biodiversity .
they are cataloguing and describing every higher plant species in mesoamerica .
sandy ' s work depends upon referring to the museum ' s botanical collections .
if it is new to science , it is described and given a new scientific name .
this information is put together to create a botanical catalogue , or flora , of mesoamerica .
the growing flora will eventually contain the descriptions of 20,000 species ; about 10 per cent of them will be new to science .
scientists will be able to add new information to the flora as it is discovered .
it is the starting point for future research into the evolution and ecology of the region ' s plants .
( state v . amar singh , air 1955 sc 282 ; ataur rahman v . state of madhya pradesh , air 1951 nag .

the founding fathers were farsighted enough to have made provisions in the constitution to protect the citizenship rights of such persons in india .
are made binding on the state , i . e . the executive as well as the legislature .
see also h . m . seeroai , constitutional law of india , first edition , p.155 ) .
here the protection provided by the article is not limited to citizens only but is applicable to all persons .
' law ' in singular in the term ' equality before law ' means what dicey meant by rule of law or the concept of law or of justice .
however , there has been no occasion for the supreme court to appreciate any such distinction .
( state of west bengal v . anwar ah sarkar , air 1952 sc 75 ) .
laws should be applied to all in the same condition .

the use of the word is significant .
clause 2 of the article provides for special application of the injunction .
the prohibition obviously covers actions both on the part of the state as well as the general public .
, ( a . k . gopalan v . state of madras , air 1950 sc 27 ) .
since the constitution does not define the expression , each case has to be judged on its own merits .
g . rao , air 1952 sc 196 ) .
the standard is really an elastic one and varies with time , space and condition from case to case .
the founding fathers made it very clear that they were not writing on a clean slate .
they took a conscious decision not to make a complete departure from the past , but to build on the existing structure and experience of institutions already established .
even otherwise , the constitution of india had had an organic growth .
category b : those bills containing provisions involving expenditure from the consolidated fund ( articles 110 and 117 ) .
in case of any question arising whether a bill is a money bill , the decision of the speaker shall be final .
a money bill can be introduced only in the lok sabha and only on the recommendation of the president .
the bill is deemed to be passed by both the houses with the amendments accepted by lok sabha .
the legislative assembly is the master of its own procedure and is the sole judge of the question whether its contempt has been committed or not .
the government , therefore , decided that an amendment of the constitution was not necessary .
while the prime minister usually is a member of the lok sabha , the ministers are drawn from both houses of parliament .
the scheme of the constitution represents a real fusion of the highest executive and legislative authorities .
the two are not visualized as competing centres of power but as inseparable partners or co - partners in the business of government .
but , the parliament is a large body .
the concept of the supremacy of dharma was hardly different from the rule of law or limited government .
the rulers in ancient india were bound by dharma , no one was above dharma .
the rigveda and the atharvaveda mention the sabha ( general assembly ) and the samiti ( house of elders ) .
after the mahabharata particularly , large empires gave way to a number of small republican states .
jatakas make many references to how these republics functioned .
representatives were elected in open assembly .
who became king and ruled with the help of a council of ministers .
the procedure may be regulated by parliament by law ( article 124 ) .
in the case of justice ramaswamy , motion for presenting an address to the president for his removal failed to get the required majority in lok sabha .
contrary to the common belief , there is no provision in our constitution for the impeachment of a judge .
the impeachment is provided for the president and none else .
he was , in fact , a limited or a constitutional monarch .
it was on 31 december 1600 that the east india company formed by some merchants of london secured from queen elizabeth a royal charter .
our constitution very largely follows the u . s . practice in this regard .
while reviewing such enactment , the supreme court will examine whether jurisdictional limits have been transgressed .
incorporation of a chapter on fundamental rights in the constitution makes judicial review specially relevant .
the burden of providing all the facts and proof against the constitutionality of the statute lies with the petitioners .
doctrine of severability : while interpreting the statute , the court has to decide whether the law as a whole or only some parts thereof attract unconstitutionality .
the court can declare a law void in part as well , if the facts so warrant .
the state legislatures may by law levy taxes on professions , trades , callings or employment .
the total amount of these taxes payable by an individual shall not exceed rs . 2500 .
the provision would not affect the power of parliament to make laws in respect of income from professions etc . ( article 276 )
the president shall cause the recommendations of the commission and action taken thereon to be laid before each house of parliament ( articles 280 - 281 ) .
of consolidated funds , contingency funds and moneys credited to public accounts are to regulated by parliament and each state legislature concerned ( article 283 ) .
article 30 seeks to protect the rights of all minorities - based on religion or language - to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice .
all such reports may be laid before houses of parliament and sent to the state governments concerned .
language of legislatures article 120 lays down the official language of parliament .
it says inter alia that the business in parliament shall be transacted in hindi or in english .
the corresponding language provision for state legislatures is article 210 .
formation of indian national congress : the indian national congress was founded in 1885 .
it initiated the process of gradual relaxation of imperial control and the evolution of responsible government in india .
from its very inception , the congress rhade gradual introduction of representative institutions in the country as the main plank of its platform .
the congress considered the reform of the councils " as the root of all other reforms . "
on it depends the entire future of the country and the future of our administrative system . "
the congress had the satisfaction of being " responsible for unifying indians for the common purposes of their political enfranchisement . "
fresh elections to the central legislative assembly which were overdue were held in the last quarter of 1945 .
sarat chandra bose was the leader of the congress legislature party .
the indian independence act 1947 introduced some changes .
the dominion legislature was vested with " full power to make laws . . . including laws having extraterritorial operation " .
there was a council of ministers " to aid and advise the governor - general in the exercise of his functions " .
but it is extremely doubtful if indian polity can be described as federal .
the word ' federation ' is nowhere used in the text of the constitution .
in fact , the proposal to describe india as a ' federation ' was specifically turned down in the constituent assembly .
article 1 of the constitution described india as a ' union of states ' .
there are many features of the constitution and a large number of its provisions which very clearly and strongly militate against it being a federal constitution .
unlike in the united states of america , the citizenship in india is one ; the flag is one ; the constitution is one .
the judiciary also is one integrated whole and not divided between the union and the states .
the union of india as of today is composed of 25 states and 7 union territories as specified in the first schedule of the constitution .
the executive enjoys i the right to formulate the budget .
the constitution provides for an annual statement of the estimated receipts and ( expenditure to be placed before the parliament .
no taxes can be legally levied and no expenditure incurred from the public exchequer without specific parliamentary authorisation by law .
the 19th century british concept of parliamentary control over the executive is no more valid even in the ' mother of parliaments ' .
parliament does not control the government .
still another procedural device is that of the calling attention notices .
members can also write to the concerned ministers and ask for the information they may need and the information is usually supplied .
on an institutional plane , another method for the parliament to inform itself and receive necessary feedback is through the reports of various parliamentary committees .
some political parties have their own research and reference staff who feed their members with the necessary information particularly from the party position angle .
the press plays a particularly important informational role in parliamentary life .
elitist politics is gradually giving way to a healthy ruralised politics .
for , if the executive is responsible to the parliament , the parliament and its members are also answerable to the people .
the member is the chief communication channel and link between the people he represents and the parliament and the government .
in fact , the parliament has been in the forefront of social reforms .
parliament does not make laws .
it has neither the time nor the necessary know - how for the purpose .
initiative in legislation as in so much else has passed almost completely to the executive and to the departments of the administration .
the modern concept of law is not that of a body of rules of action of general application , established by authority , etc .
record of proceedings : a full verbatim record of the proceedings of the two houses of parliament is prepared and published .
also parliamentary reporters take down the proceedings in shorthand in relays or turns of five or ten minutes each .
sessionwise printed volumes of debates are available in hindi and english versions .
he enjoys supreme authority over the secretarial staff , the precincts of the house and the parliament house estate .
prior to 1921 , the governor - general of india used to preside over the sittings of the legislative council .
the origin of the institution of speaker in india dates back to 1921 when the central legislative assembly was first constituted under the montague - chelmsford reforms .
sir frederick whyte was appointed by the governor - general as the first speaker of the ) assembly on 3 february 1921 for a period of four years ,
shri vithalbhai j . patel was the first non - official to be elected as the speaker of the assembly on 24 august 1925 .
shri patel had the distinction of being the first indian and the first elected speaker of the central legislature .
shri g . v . mavalankar was chosen as the first speaker of the first parliament constituted after the first general elections after independence .
the number of questions admitted was 98,390 during the eighth and 21,550 during the ninth lok sabha period .
these facts amply demonstrate the efficacy of the question procedure and utility of the question hour .
the constitution provides for a consolidated fund of india to which all revenues received by way of loans , advances , etc . are credited .
in other words , they constitute the non - votable part of the budget .
no such demand shall be made except on the recommendation of the president .
no money can be withdrawn from the consolidated fund of india except under an appropriation act passed by the parliament .
an all - parties conference organised at bombay on 19 may 1928 appointed a committee , under the chairmanship of motilal nehru .
the report embodied not only the perspective of the contemporary nationalist opinion but also an outline of a draft constitution for india .
the latter was based on the principle of dominion status .
the white paper issued after the third round table conference outlined the british government ' s proposal for constitutional reforms in india .
this was the first time that a definite demand for a constituent assembly was formally put forward .
second , the work load of the house is enormous .
it does not have the time to undertake detailed investigations or even to discuss every matter at length .
under the circumstances , the select committees and the joint committees on bills may inter alia perform the role of the traditional second chamber .
the secretariats , thus , function as independent entities under the ultimate guidance and control of the chairman / speaker , as the case may be .
these expenses are met from the consolidated fund of india .
the parliament sanctions the expenditure through the appropriation act every year .
no cut motions or any discussion relating to the demands of the two houses and their secretariats is allowed on the floor of the house .
waving of hands to attract the attention of the chair is not considered to be the normal parliamentary practice .
no member should speak unless he has caught the chair ' s eye and has been called upon by the chair to speak .
members are to speak from their allotted seats and rise while speaking .
a member disabled by sickness or infirmity is , however , permitted by the speaker to speak while sitting .
this may appear to be a mere formality , but it is sought to be practised assiduously so that debates are prevented from developing into dialogues between members .
it is all right as far as it goes in theory , but it will not work , ' said ramalinga .
either it is beyond speech and thought , or it is not .
and if they do , that will go against the nature of brahman .
only when the mind is done away with does the experience of brahman appear .
when the mind steps in , ever . so stealthily , the knowledge which is also the experience of brahman goes .
that which cannot be seen by the eyes , but by which the eyes are seen , know that is brahman , and not what is worshipped here .
that which cannot be heard by the ears , but by which the ears are heard , know that is brahman , and not what is worshipped here .
he spoke like a prophet inspired , with a sense of his mission derived from god and of his living in god :
he gave his call in no uncertain terms :
( in his tract on compassion he has explicitly stated that these are irrelevant in the exercise of compassion . )
in may 1870 , after four years in vadalur , ramalinga shifted to mettukuppam .
he was accommodated in a house which had been a rest - house for visiting religious heads of the vaishnava cult and fallen into disuse for years .
it was a small building consisting of a single room .
he selected an open space of about fifty acres by the eating house .
i desire that this great joy should equally be yours .
it was open to all castes , cults , creeds and religions .
they might worship from outside .
according to him , mukti and siddhi are two sides of the same medal , mukti representing the state ripened for being , and siddhi the being itself .
to put his disciples and followers at ease , he fore - wained them in one of his regular ' instructions ' to them :
be assured that you will reap benefit through me .
in a few days i shall , by the grace of god , have my body hidden from you .
then , after giving a brief sketch of the life , personality and teachings of ramalinga , velayuda mudaliar continues :
i need hardly remark that these principles are identically those of the theosophical society .
but during the last quarter of the year , he gave up lecturing entirely and maintained an almost unbroken silence .
when he recovered it , " i was as if no longer the same man .
on his return home he gave away many of his personal possessions to friends and others .
but merely divesting himself of material possessions brought him neither joy nor understanding .
life was dreary , the world was like a graveyard . "
in this state of mind , " one day all of a sudden i saw a page from some sanskrit book flutter past me .
the father was naturally disappointed and annoyed .
one shrewd precaution the father did take .
a , superb gambler , he knew that fortune was an uncertain mistress .
soon after dwarkanath ' s death in london , it was discovered that die firm ' s liabilities far exceeded its ready assets .
there was a rush on the bank and the famous house of carr , tagore &amp; co . had to close its doors .
almost every year he left his home and travelled over the western plains to the himalayas .
he was a keen observer of nature and men and his autobiography is full of vivid descriptions of nature and shrewd observations on men and events .
and yet muddied and bereft of their pride , they will fertilise the land and help mankind .
great as were the maharshi ' s many other gifts to his people , the greatest was his fourteenth child .
however , when the child was born the event seemed of little significance .
the child was named rabindranath , or rabi for short .
sarada devi must have been a woman of uncommon character , tact and patience to keep such a household together and in harmony .
her eldest son dwijendranath was a man of gigantic intellect , poet , musician , philosopher and mathematician .
in whatever he did he revealed a mind of great originality , an imagination , fertile and inventive .
his experiments in poetic composition , ingenious and daring , left a deep impress on the development of his youngest brother .
nor is he less distinguished as a thinker and writer of philosophic prose .
her second son satyendranath was the first indian to break into the stronghold of the indian civil service .
but he has other and better claims to distinction .
he was a fine scholar of sanskrit and wielded an excellent pen in bengali and in english .
he was also the first writer to introduce marathi religious poetry to bengali readers .
in english he translated the maharshi ' s autobiography which was later published by macmillans , london .
his young wife was a girl of considerable beauty and intelligence butlike most women of that period more or less illiterate and in purdah .
he succeeded in educating her , not only in bengali and english , but in all the accomplishments of the age .
commenting on this little mercy the poet wrote many years later : " learning should as far as possible follow die process of eating .
to him in heaven my grateful reverence . "
he strove to break the british monopoly of shipping and industry and nearly ruined himself financially in the process .
his influnce on the intellectual and poetic development of his younger and more famous brother was considerable .
her motherliness had been taxed to the utmost and she had perhaps little surplus left to spare .
and yet years later when he recalled his childhood there was no trace of self - pity .
for love sharpens the eye and enlarges the understanding . "
in friendship one plus one are three , in love one plus one are one . "
" suffering is another word for obsession with self .
that is why the sight of beauty brings joy by taking us away from ourselves . "
needless to say , i do not agree with them who thus malign the fair sex . "
" our ancients said that modesty is woman ' s best ornament .
but women put on so many ornaments that there is little room left form this one . "
though he stayed in ahmedabad for about four months only , the period marks a stage in his mental development .
they simply do it for the pleasure of pleasing .
for example , she asked me once very particularly to remember one thing : ' you must never wear a beard .
but she herself did not live to see my disobedience proclaimed upon my face . "
he used to read this poem to her and to translate it into english for her .
in september 1878 , rabindra sailed for england with his elder brother satyendranath .
ladies are very particular about their appearance but all they need wash regularly are the face , arms and hands .
in many houses there are no bathrooms at all . "
" despite the many differences between the ways of women here and in our own country , there is one diing common between them .
he poured himself out in a cascade of songs and wrote his first musical play , valmiki pratibha ( the genius of valmiki ) .
this is not a play to be read , as the author has himself warned us , but to be seen and heard on the stage .
moved to pity , valmiki rescues the girl , disbands the gang and wanders in search of his true vocation .
the goddess saraswati reveals herself to him and tells him that it was she who had asumed the form of the young girl to waken his humanity .
your voice shall resound from land to land and many poets will echo your songs . "
with this play rabindra led his revolt against the prevailing orthodox tradition in indian music .
he did not , however , attempt the creation of new forms in abstract music .
his own music is so inextricably blended with the poetry of words that it is almost impossible to separate the musical mode from the poetic mood .
hence his songs cannot be fully enjoyed by those who miss the elusive music of the words .
he had heard serious european music , too , during his stay in england and had gradually learnt to appreciate its beauty .
he had read in herbert spencer ' s the origin and function of music that it is emotion that gives tuneful inflexion to speech .
article 1 ( 3 ) ( c ) of the constitution made it clear that the union of india could acquire foreign territory .
( maganbhai ishwarbhai patel v . union of india ( 1970 ) 3 scc 100 ) .
thus , the preamble provisions of our constitution put an end to concepts of traditional federalism , divided sovereignty , autonomy of states etc .
socialism the founding fathers did not want the constitution to be wedded to any particular political ideology or ism or to be limited by any economic doctrine .
they did not , therefore , agree to include any reference inter alia to socialism .
but , the preamble did mention the resolve to secure to all citizens economic justice and equality of status and opportunity .
and , the constitution ( forty - second amendment ) act , 1976 introduced the word .
it is perhaps the most powerful poem in the whole book , virile and intense .
whatever else the young poet had seen or not seen of life at first hand , he had known love .
innocent and sublime as he imagined this love to be , he could not have altogether escaped its agony and torture .
the text of the preamble as amended gives almost the highest place of honour to the objective of ' socialism ' .
it is mentioned next only to ' sovereign ' .
however , the term ' socialism ' has not been defined by the constitution .
it has meant different things to different people and is hardly left with any one definite connotation .
socialism meant elimination of inequality in income and status and standards of living .
the woman triumphs by her suffering .
there the queen is aligned with forces of reaction against her husband .
now , as later in life , whenever he was in such a mood he wanted to travel .
if he could not go far he must at least change his house .
the first entry is dated 22 august 1890 , the day the steamer sailed from bombay .
but these musings evaporate as the ship heaves and tosses in the monsoon - troubled waters of the arabian sea .
the ocean - liner seemed to him " a castle of indolence " where the passengers did not know what to do with their time .
to give effect to an agreement with pakistan for transfer of part of the berubari territory , therefore , the constitution ( ninth amendment ) act was passed .
part ii , articles 5 - 11 citizenship constitutes the indispensable foundational principle of democratic polity .
the act also made specific provisions regarding commonwealth citizenship .
all citizens irrespective of the state in which they were born have the same rights and duties all over the country without any discrimination .
a comprehensive charter of rights was soon evolved through various stages in the assembly and its committees .
dr .
it reflected in no small measure the anxiety of the founding fathers to incorporate and implement the basic principles enunciated in the universal declaration .
the values of freedom and equality befitting the dignity of the human individual , so eloquently proclaimed by the preamble .
these fundamental rights substantially cover all the traditional civil and political rights enumerated in articles 2 to 21 of the universal declaration .
articles 33 - 35 deal with the power of parliament to modify the rights conferred by part iii of the constitution in their application to forces .
it is true that the fundamental human rights enshrined in the constitution of india are hedged inby many limitations and restrictions .
the fundamental rights secured to the individual are in the nature of limitations or restrictions on the actions of the state .
( state of west bengal v . subodh gopal base , air 1954 sc 92 ) .
in other words , rebellion , waging war against the state , insurrection etc .
defamation : the right to free speech and expression does not entitle a citizen to defame a person .
defines the law of defamation as exposing a man to hatred , ridicule or contempt has been upheld by the courts .
incitement to an offence : this ground for restricting freedom of speech and expression was also added in 1951 .
the supreme court has taken the view that incitement to murder or other violent crimes would generally endanger the security of the state .
( state of ' bihar v . shailabala devi , air 1952 sc 329 ) .
freedom to assemble meetings , processions and demonstrations are inevitable corollaries of a democratic system .
speaking in the constituent assembly , dr .
ambedkar had categorically said that the directive principles were not intended to be mere pious declarations .
that the environment is protected and improved andthe forests and wild life are safeguarded ( article 48 a ) .
( also see the chapter on ' fundamental rights ' under ' right to property and saving of certain laws ' , article 31 c ) .
they are all equally important and have to be read with each other .
it has , however , been held in the gopalan case that within the specified limits of its powers , the parliament is supreme .
functions of parliament legislation : traditionally the main function of a legislature is to legislate .
in regard to the union list , the parliament ' s jurisdiction is exclusive .
both the union and the states have concurrent power to legislate in respect of entries in the concurrent list .
in case of conflict between the union and the state laws , the former prevails ( article 254 ) .
also , the residuary powers vest in the union parliament ( article 248 and entry 97 of the union list ) .
no grounds , arguments , proofs or justification are necessary .
( for further study , see subhash c . kashyap , our parliament , nbt , new delhi , 3rd edn .
he can do so only with previous consent of the president and after consultation with the chief justice of the high court concerned .
the judge so appointed is duty bound to give priority to the supreme court duties .
this too can be done with the previous consent of the president and also of the person to be so appointed ( articles 127 and 128 ) .
power and jurisdiction of the court :
the opinion is only advisory , which the president is free to follow or not to follow .
the due process of law gives wide scope to the supreme court to grant protection to the rights of its citizens .
it is not expected to go into the question of its reasonableness , suitability or policy implications .
the supreme court pronounces its judgement on a specific case through a specific petition .
it does not give its opinion or advice on a general reference .
there should be an aggrieved person who petitions the court to challenge the constitutionality of the statute which has adversely affected his rights .
after this judgement , it has been open to public - minded individual citizens or social organizations to seek judicial relief in the interest of the general public .
also , an independent and impartial judiciary is an essential requisite for ensuring human rights and protecting democracy .
only an independent judiciary can act effectively as the guardian of the rights of the individual and that of the constitution .
the constitution provides for a high court for each state .
prohibition is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal and is intended to prohibit it from exceeding its jurisdiction .
appointment of persons other than district judges to the judicial service of a state shall be made by the governor in accordance with rules made thereunder .
besides the state public service commission , the high court has to be consulted in the matter of such appointments ( article 234 ) .
in fact , with special provisions for some of the individual states , it may be said that there are several state constitutions within the constitution of india .
generally speaking , provisions for the states follow the union pattern .
the real executive power is exercised by the ministers . '
he may be removed by the president at any time ( surya narain v . union of india , air 1982 raj .
some of the governors may have to discharge certain special responsibilities also under articles 371 to 3711 .
the executive power of the state is coextensive with its legislative power .
the governor appoints the chief minister and other ministers on the advice of the chief minister .
before the union constitution committee could transact any worthwhile business , the mountbatten plan of 3 june 1947 was announced .
all hopes of preserving the unity of india vanished and the partition of the country on communal lines became a firm decision .
such laws can be extended to other states provided the concerned state legislatures pass resolutions to that effect .
administrative relations articles 256 to 265 seek to regulate administrative relations between the union and the states .
it is common in federal systems that the administrative relations between the union and the states are fraught with difficulties .
the constitution of india seeks to achieve a smooth working relationship between the two levels .
it provides that the executive powers of the state government are to be exercised in such a way as to ensure compliance with the laws made by parliament .
the union executive is also empowered to give such directions to a state as may appear to the government of india to be necessary for the purpose .
also , the comptroller and auditor - general has been made ineligible for any other office under the government of india or any state government .
his salary etc . is left to be determined by parliament by law .
of comptroller and auditor - general have been equated with the judges of the supreme court .
similarly , there will be a consolidated fund for each of the states .
thisrestriction does not apply to public accounts ( article 266 ) .
article 290 a provides for certain sums to be paid annually to devaswom funds of travancore and tamil nadu from the consolidated funds of these states .
a state may also similarly borrow subject to limits set by law by the state legislature .
government of india , within its borrowing powers , may make loans to any state or give guarantees in respect of loans raised by the state .
so long as any of such loans remain outstanding , the state government may not raise any further loans without consent of government of india ( article 293 ) .
things of value within territorial waters or continental shelf and resources of the exclusive economic zone shall vest in the union ( article 297 ) .
this article obviously is an independent or additional source of executive power outside article 245 .
all expenses of the union and state service commissions are charged on the consolidated fund of the union or the state concerned ( article 322 ) .
the chairman and members of the public service commissions are appointed by the president or the governor as the case may be .
thus , no government department , agency or officer can refuse to entertain a representation on the ground of its not being in the official language .
the court held that the order violated article 351 in as much as it excited emotion against hindi instead of promoting it .
an authoritative hindi text of the constitution has since been published .
the eighth schedule besides hindi , our constitution also recognizes other languages and the need for their development .
the montford report ( 1918 ) : the report on indian constitutional reforms known as the montagu - chelms - ford or montford report .
without paying any heed to the demand for the status of self - governing dominions ,
as supplemented by rules made under it , the 1919 act introduced many important changes in the indian constitutional system .
there is no limitation placed upon the amending power , that is to say , there is no provision of the constitution which cannot be amended .
fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution ( part iii ) are subject to parliament ' s power toamend the constitution .
state of kerala ( air 1973 sc 1461 ) the supreme court reviewed the decision in the golak nath case .
the law declared in golak nath case was accordingly overruled .
what constituted the basic structure was , however , not clearly made out by the majority and remained an open question .
for the first time it gave the representatives of the people a voice in making laws and influencing governmental policies .
it also played a great role in the shaping of the political destinies of the country .
while the country was fighting to overthrow foreign domination , the representatives of the people assembled in the legislature carried the battle into the house .
the world saw an alien government bow to the wishes of the people to accept defeat .
annie besant declared the scheme to be " unworthy to be offered by britain and received by india . "
the three words ? representative , parliamentary and democracy ? are the cardinal features of our political system .
bills belonging to certain categories can be introduced and proceeded with only after the recommendation of the president has been obtained .
there are certain othfer functions which the president is required to perform under the constitution in relation to the parliament .
he appoints the speaker pro - tern of lok sabha and an acting chairman of rajya sabha , as and when the need arises .
he summons the joint sitting of both houses in case of disagreement between them on a bill .
the other ministers are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister . "
it may be pointed out here that the president has little opportunity of exercising a personal choice in appointing the prime minister .
while the prime minister usually is a member of the lok sabha , ministers are drawn from both houses of parliament .
at the same time , every minister holds office during the pleasure of the president and shall be liable to dismissal by him .
but since the president does so only on the advice of the prime minister , this power actually rests with the latter .
the relationship between the executive and the legislature is one that is most intimate and ideally does not admit any antagonism or dichotomy .
in other words , the executive is not a separate or outside body .
there is , however , a clear distinction between the functions of the executive and the functions of the parliament .
parliament is to legislate , advise , criticise and ventilate public grievances .
the executive is to govern , albeit on behalf of the parliament .
in the words of the first secretary of the indian parliament :
articles32and 226 confer power on the supreme court and the high courts , respectively , for the enforcement of these rights .
is repugnant to the provisions of the constitution , or ( iii ) it infringes one of the fundamental rights .
this is very misleading and patently wrong .
the territory of the union is divided amongst the states and the union territories .
a law made by a state legislature can be applicable only in the territory of that state .
the union parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of india .
no such power of legislation is available to the states .
the constitution provides for a three - fold distribution of legislative power between the union and the states .
list i or the union list contains 97 subjects over which the parliament has exclusive power to make laws .
list ii or the state list includes 66 entries over which state legislatures have got exclusive power of legislation .
list iii or the concurrent list contains 47 items on which both the parliament and the state legislatures can make laws .
the parliament may enter the state list by invitation also .
alter the boundaries of any state ; and ( iv ) alter the name of any state .
such a bill is required to be referred to the legislatures of the states concerned for expressing their views thereon within the time allowed for the purpose .
however , this reference in practice , does not fetter the hands of the parliament in making the change as it thinks fit .
as has been said elsewhere :
the operative reality of politics today is that the real power resides in the prime minister and his or her cabinet and not in parliament .
the prime minister is the leader of the majority in lok sabha and also the head of the government .
he may consult two or three colleagues and go ahead .
it is ultimately the prime minister who is responsible to the parliament and the nation for the policies which the government pursues .
administration is run by the permanent civil services .
the parliament does not interfere with day - to - day administration nor does it control administration .
most of the raw material for parliamentary questions , motions and debates comes from the daily press and this is an important instrument on which a member relies .
simultaneously , the press keeps the people informed of what is happening in parliament .
this two - way traffic enables the press to maintain an important and strong link between the public and the parliament .
even though so much information from such a variety of sources is available to parliament , it is not enough .
it is as well that the parliamentary debates should serve to remind the administration of their duties and obligations .
and , this may be called the advisory role of the parliament . !
this is especially so if the person against whom an allegation has been made does not have a chance to come before the house and explain his position .
in order to ascertain their factual basis , such questions , before admission may be referred to the ministries / departments concerned .
members are also sometimes asked to furnish material in support of the allegations made in the question .
it should be noted that questions should not relate to a matter which is not primarily the concern of the government of india .
the distribution of questions between starred and unstarred categories depends upon the conditions provided in the rules .
the mission was in india from march 1946 to may 1946 .
the cabinet mission also rejected the congress scheme of a loose federation as involving constitutional disadvantages and anomalies .
2 . the union should have an executive and a legislature constituted from british indian and states ' representatives .
3 . all subjects other than the union subjects and allresiduary powers should vest in the provinces .
thereafter , at the end , the minister concerned replies .
it may be said with a fair amount of certainty that members have been evincing keen interest in using the right of asking questions .
it was , therefore , considered that some procedure might be devised whereby members might have an opportunity of bringing urgent matters to the attention of the government .
in the modern parliamentary procedure the idea of introducing calling attention notices in the rules of procedure is purely an indian innovation .
the minister may make a brief statement or ask for time to make the statement at a later date .
the members ' chief source for tabling the calling attention notices is the daily newspapers .
sometimes they may be based on the private information of a member or on the correspondence between him and his constituents .
notices of calling attention have to be given by members in writing by 10.00 a . m .
a member can give not more than two calling attention notices for any one sitting .
notices on the same subject may be given by more than one member , but names of not more than five members are shown in the list of business .
the speaker goes through the notices and selects one of them for a statement by the concerned minister at the sitting of the house on a following day .
in certain cases , the speaker may select two such notices to be taken up at one sitting .
not more than two notices can be taken up at one sitting to call the attention of ministers .
the main purpose , therefore , of calling attention is to seek an authoritative statement from a minister on a matter of urgent nature .
this process does not involve any censure against the government as there is no regular discussion and voting .
while raising his point , the member is not permitted to deviate from the approved text of his statement .
it may be noted that matters so raised are not included in the list of business .
it has been seen that the members are increasingly taking recourse to this rule and this procedure has become very popular .
being an assembly of a large number of people , ascertaining opinion or the will of the house is a difficult task .
stibstitute motions : motions moved in substitution of the original motion and proposing an alternative to it are called substitute motions .
discussion is held on both the original and the substitute motions together but vote of the house is taken only on the substitute motion .
similarly , in the rajya sabha resolution may be in the form of declaration of opinion by the house or in such other form as the chairman considers appropriate .
the following resolutions moved in the lok sabha will illustrate the general forms and the varied subjects that are dealt with in such resolutions :
the difference between them , in fact , is more of procedure than of content .
quite often , both , motions and resolutions on the same subject are admitted with some slight change of form .
though no period has been prescribed for this , in actual practice , ministers give such notices several days in advance .
these notices are also subject to the same rules of admissibility as the private members ' resolutions .
after a government resolution has been admitted , time for discussion is allotted by the house on the recommendation of the business advisory committee .
statutory resolutions : these resolutions may be moved either by a minister or by a private member .
in such a easel if more than six months elapse from the date it receives the bill , a deadlock is deemed to have taken place .
such a joint - sitting is presided over by the speaker who is assisted by the secretary - general , the lok sabha . '
the joint - sitting is governed by the rules of procedure of the lok sabha .
at the joint - sitting , only such amendments can be proposed which become necessary due to the delay in the passage of the bill .
if the president withholds his assent , there is an end to the bill .
the rajya sabha cannot reject a money bill nor can it amend it by virtue of its own powers .
hence , there is no provision of a joint - sitting in the case of a money bill .
financial bills the constitution distinguishes money bills from the financial bills .
generally speaking , a financial bill may be any bill which relates to revenue or expenditure .
it may be repeated that the provision for joint - sitting is not applicable in the case of a money bill .
it does not require the recommendation of the president for its introduction .
however , the recommendation of the president is essential for its consideration by either house .
constitution ( amendment ) bills the procedure for amendment of the constitution of india has been laid down in art . 368 .
the constitution does not provide for a separate constituent body ; the power to amend the constitution is vested in the parliament .
an amendment of the constitution may be initiated by introduction of a bill for the purpose in either house of parliament .
such a bill may be brought forward by the government or by a private member .
generally , constitution ( amendment ) bills brought forward by ministers are introduced in the lok sabha .
he , however , is not bound by the views so ascertained .
by convention , a motion for leave to introduce a private member ' s bill is not opposed .
ordinarily , a member can introduce four bills in a session .
in lok sabha , the relative precedence of bills in a particular category is determined by ballot .
the bills are included in the list of business in the order of priority determined by the ballot .
in a parliamentary system , the legislature has to lay down governmental policies , make laws and oversee administration .
through the parliamentary devices like questions and debates it is not able to exercise more than a sporadic supervision of administration .
in order to make parliamentary surveillance more effective and meaningful , the parliament needs an agency of its own in which the whole house has confidence .
select or joint committees on a bill are appointed on a motion adopted by the house .
rest of the committees are nominated by the presiding officer of the house concerned .
while some of the committees are constituted by each house separately , others are constituted jointly by both the houses .
reports may be either preliminary or final .
the report of a committee is presented to the house by the chairman of the committee or any member of the committee so authorised .
it is the responsibility of the parliament to examine and approve the proposals for taxation and estimates of expenditure made by the government .
although nearly two months of the ' budget session ' are devoted for this purpose , discussions are neither very extensive nor intensive .
as the time available is short , often demands relating to a number of ministries / departments are not discussed at all and the ' guillotine ' is applied .
implementation of a policy is more important than mere formulation .
the position of the estimates committee is slightly different from the other two financial committees in this regard .
the committee can examine the working of the policy and not the policy as approved by the parliament .
it consists of 22 members ( 15 from the lok sabha and 7 from the rajya sabha ) .
as a matter of practice , since 1967 , a member of opposition is being appointed as the chairman of the committee .
such excesses are required to be brought up before the house by government for regularisation .
the committee is assisted by the comptroller and auditor - general of india who participates in its meetings . "
in other words , the committee can point out irregularities only after they have taken place and the damage has been done .
however , the investigations of the committee are taken very seriously by officials .
the very fact of the existence of such a committee has a deterrent effect on a possible administrative waste and extravagance .
the recommendations of the committee , by pointing out administrative lacunae in policy implementation , have led to valuable improvements in the financial machinery .
several corporations and government companies , commonly called ' public undertakings ' , involving large sums of money , have thus come into existence .
the chairman of the committee is appointed by the speaker from among the members of the committee drawn from the lok sabha .
the committees worked hard and in a businesslike manner and produced valuable reports .
recommendations of the other committees were later considered by the drafting committee .
the first draft of the constitution of india was prepared in october , 1947 by the advisory branch of the office of the constituent assembly .
a large number of comments , criticisms and suggestions for the amendment of the draft constitution were received .
the drafting committee considered all these .
parliamentary museum and archives india has all along attached utmost importance to parliamentary institutions .
a proposal for setting up a parliamentary museum and archives was approved by the general purposes committee of the lok sabha on 1 august 1984 .
it is proposed to present through exhibitions , models , photographs and other visual materials a panoramic view of india ' s achievements .
threat to agriculture
in areas that depend on subsistence farming , this could have serious effects for the local population .
paul ' s work will be important for understanding soil ecology in tropical environments .
it might lead to ways of ' mending ' infertile soil by re - introducing key termite species .
50 per cent of the earth ' s surface lies below two kilometres of ocean , yet we know very little about what lives there .
the deep seabed has an area of 27 million square kilometres , but we have only sampled approximately 2 km2 of it .
commercial fishing , dumping industrial waste , oil leaks and coastal development are just some of the threats to our oceans today .
without knowing the biology of our oceans , it is impossible to say how these events might affect the marine life there .
it hopes to do better in the years to come .
the speaker of the central legislative assembly was then called " president " .
the legislature is not just another club .
outside the house as well , a member is expected to observe a standard of conduct consistent with the dignity of his office .
it would be neither natural nor desirable that there should not be occasional disagreement .
the deliberations must , therefore , be animated by a spirit of mutual concession .
a member should not interrupt any member who is speaking , by disorderly manner .
also , interruptions by heckling are not permissible parliamentary practice and have been deprecated by the chair .
any point about his speech can be raised after he has finished his speech .
a member should not sit or stand with his back to the chair .
a member should not cross the floor or pass between the chair and any member who is speaking .
breach of this rule is strongly taken objection to by the chair .
visitors and galleries : references to the presence of strangers in the visitors ' gallery have been held to be out of order .
ordinarily , however , members should not applaud when a distinguished visitor enters any of the galleries , or the special box .
( i ) rulings given by the chair should not be criticised , directly or indirectly , inside or outside the house .
( ii ) a member should not give publicity in the press to the discussions held by him with the speaker in his chamber .
( iii ) a notice should not be given publicity until it has been admitted by the speaker and circulated to members .
these powers are as follows : ( i ) to commit persons , whether they are members or not , for breach of privilege or contempt of the house ;
trying to bribe a member of parliament will be a breach of privilege .
one day it was late in the night when he returned from tiruvottriyur to his brother ' s house .
beside him stood his sister - in - law with the plate of food .
he ate the food and went back to sleep .
tozhuvur who became his disciple in 1849 .
after the passing of ramalinga , he became tamil pandit in presidency college , madras .
from his birth he had no desire for material possessions , wealth or women .
in a poem he reports to his god :
and he pays tribute to manikka vachahar :
nothing is known about her subsequent life .
ramalinga ' s years in madras were marked by great literary activity .
during this period of his life , he edited certain poems of an earlier age and wrote two works in prose .
the songs that he sang about god nataraja and to nataraja are so numerous and diverse that it is difficult to choose fromthem a representative example .
this is diametrically opposed to the survival of the fittest which operates in natural evolution .
the judge too moved , as if to rise , but remembering the judicial convention , kept sitting .
starting the proceedings , he asked navalar why he stood up when the respondent entered the court .
the judge continued , ' you also stood up . '
or having filed it , you need not have stood up when he entered . your spontaneous action speaks the truth . the case is closed . '
what comprised the book , as published during ramalinga ' s life - time , were the first four sections of the book as it is today .
it is said , the blessed saint had a - body which transcended photography .
it cast no shadow . '
even his physical characteristics , habits , dress and the like are alluded to .
he refers to his white dress in a verse , which describes certain other features also :
this walking picture of ramalinga brings out the quintessence
india ' s constitution has been variously described .
as dr .
ambedkar said , rigidity and legalism were the two serious weaknesses of federalism .
under article 249 , the union parliament can invade the state list .
moving the draft constitution for adoption by the constituent assembly , the chairman of the drafting committee , dr .
the text of the constitution does not anywhere use the term ' federal ' or ' federation ' .
appasami chettiar , one of ramalinga ' s admirers , used to come to karunguzhi from cuddalore ( then called gudalur ) to see his master .
haying had his brother cured of an indolent sore on the tongue by the grace of ramalinga , he placed his hospitality at ramalinga ' s service .
there was once an ascetic who went naked in the streets .
a certain man , who saw him , was struck by his indifference to the flesh , and gave him a plantain .
i have brought both to you , one as witness to the othei ' s deed . '
without going through this stage it was not possible to attain the ultimate realisation , he felt .
the munduka upanishad ( mundaka 3 , kanda 2 , verse 3 ) :
the atman of him who wisely employs all these means enters the state of brahman . )
hold your patience for a while .
finally , a sculptor from pannurutti made an image of him in clay and showed it to him .
it is stated that ramalinga remarked , ' so the golden body has become clay . '
and again : no death ever for me !
he exhorted them :
the enquiry is this : what is our human situation , what is the nature of the powers that he beyond us and move us ?
you may likewise gain divine life if you likewise give up all .
he considers these as accretions and ' falsehood ' , and dismisses them .
he even removed the word veda ( meaning religion ) from the original name of his society which he finally called satya sanmarga sangam .
he defined the sanmargam , or ' good path ' as the approach to god by self - identification with god and with life and the universe .
col . henry s . olcott was the first president of the society , and madame blavatsky the first secretary .
tozhuvur velayuda mudaliar , the first and best - known disciple of ramalinga , met madame blavatsky and col . olcott when they were in madras .
at that time velayuda mudaliar was a tamil pundit in presidency college , madras .
little did our loyal friend fancy , when he was penning these lines , that his assertion would one day be capable of corroboration by the testimony of thousands .
following the statement of velayuda mudaliar is a comment by madame blavatsky , also reproduced in the theo - sophist , issue of july 1882 :
this is one of those cases of previous fore - telling of a coming event , which is least of all open to suspicions of bad faith .
in march 1873 , we were directed to proceed from russia to paris .
in june we were told to proceed to the united states where we arrived on july 6th .
this was the very time when ramalinga was most forcibly prefiguring the events which should happen .
this internal consciousness is the common quintessential core of all life .
no sooner was he gone than the drawing master arrived .
the child would nod , then jerk himself awake with a start , and then nod again , missing far more than he read .
they have their language lessons early in the morning and how gleefully they learn them ! "
brajeswar was the name of the servant who was in charge of looking after the child ' s meals .
he had a way of appropriating part of the rations for himself .
he would dangle each delicacy before the hungry boy and ask in a stern voice , " do you want any more ? "
it merely roused envy and unbelief .
stolen goods , they said . "
the splendid cadence and intonaton of this vedlc verse appealed strongly to his feeling for rhythm and his sense of the mysterious sublime .
the shaven head was sure to be a target of jeers of the irreverent anglo - indian classmates .
at last they reached their cottage at bakrota , perched on the top of a mountain .
the boy was now free to wander about and feast his eyes on the loveliness and grandeur of the himalayas spread out before him .
an iron - spiked stick in hand he roamed at will , wandering from peak to peak .
the father kept no guard on him .
early in the morning , long before the sun rose , he woke up the boy and practised with him sanskrit declensions .
sanskrit lessons over , the father and son had their morning glass of milk .
the maharshi would then chant verses from the upanishads , the boy listening , spell - bound by the sonorous rhythm .
by the time the sun rose above the eastern peak they would be on their morning walk .
returning home the father gave him an hour ' s lesson in english , after which " came the bath in icy - cold water " .
their immediate effect was that when he returned to calcutta he was no longer a child .
" i cannot say that my head was not turned . "
he was now the centre of interest at his mother ' s open - air gatherings on the roof - terrace in the evening .
but the biggest feather in his cap was his recitation of ramayana in the original sanskrit of valmiki .
" do read us the ramayana , rabi dear , " the proud mother would coax .
no coaxing was needed .
but if he imagined that his new status would earn him an exemption from attendance at school , he was mistaken .
soon after , he changed his school once again and was admitted into st . xavier ' swith no better result .
while the teaching here was as dull and mechanical as in the previous schools , the atmosphere was rendered even more cheerless by the solemn observance of religious forms .
finally in 1875 , at the age of fourteen , he gave up going to school altogether .
but the truant from school did not idle away his time .
he mustwoo her in his own fashion .
the family atmosphere was congenial for such wayward pursuit of knowledge .
he was then 13 years and 10 months of age .
she was young enough to play at dolls ' weddings and on such occasions invited her young brother - in - law to partake of the feast .
she was an excellent cook and regaled him with dishes which were unknown in brajeswar ' s cuisine .
when he read to her his new compositions , she merely smiled and remarked , how much better other poets had written .
nothing but sorrow have i ever gained except when left freely to myself . "
" the jungle was dense , and in its lights and shadows the tiger refused to show himself .
a rough kind of ladder was made by cutting footholds in a stout bamboo , and jyotidada climbed up with his gun ready . to hand .
as for me , i was not even wearing slippers , i had not even that poor instrument with which to beat and humiliate the tiger .
it roared furiously , biting at all the sticks and twigs within reach , and lashing its tail .
thinking it over , i know that it is not in the nature of tigers to wait so long and patiently to be killed .
i wonder if some one had the forethought to mix a little opium with its feed on the previous night !
the kavi kahini is in fact the story of this young poet ' s spiritual bewilderment and groping .
he wanders disconsolate in the forest and chances upon a maiden with whom he falls in love .
her name is nalini a name that was to remain a favourite with rabindranath .
the poet is happy at first but soon wearies of dalliance in love and mere happiness .
it was here that he first composed his own music for his songs .
anna ( her full name was annapurna ) was only slightly older than rabi .
the only other members of the household were " his mild little wife " and her pet dog .
whenever barker wanted to punish his wife he tortured the poor dog .
they sat silent and glum through the dinner much to the discomfort of the embarrassed guest .
mrs barker would mumble back , " i wish you were a little more polite . "
" but i did say ' please ' , " barker protested .
" i did not hear it , " said the wife .
" it was no fault of mine , " the husband remonstrated .
as against monarchy or dictatorship which were autocratic rule of one person , oligarchy or aristocracy being rule by the few .
in a democracy the people are supposed to be their own masters .
they have an inalienable right to rule themselves , or to be ruled in the way they like and by the people they choose .
democracy also recognises the fact that from time immemorial human beings have been fighting with each other for power or for supremacy .
democracy tries to substitute a more civilised manner of fighting .
it is substitution of the methods of discussion and persuasion for methods of armed conflict .
in the ancient indian village republics and the greek city states , all the citizens assembled together and decided issues of governance .
from the british commonwealth , it became the commonwealth of nations .
the commonwealth specifically recognised india ' s status as a sovereign independent republic .
it did not therefore , affect the sovereign , democratic or republican nature of the state .
without social and economic democracy , political democracy had no meaning in a poor country like india .
dr .
ambedkar , social and economic democracy was the real aim and ultimate goal .
he said that parliamentary democracy was meaningless unless it was geared to achieving the real goal of economic democracy .
jawaharlal nehru had observed later that democracy of his conception was only a means to an end .
the end was the good life for the individual which must include a certain satisfaction of the essential economic needs .
only in the measure that democracy succeeds in solving the economic problems , does it succeed even in the political field .
if the economic problems are not solved then the political structure tends to weaken and crack up .
this is made clear by the words of the preamble which speak of securing to all citizens of the republic ' justice , social , economic and political ' .
most significantly , the preamble places justice higher than the other principles of liberty , equality and fraternity .
the concept of justice in the preamble is indeed very wide .
it is not confined to the narrow legal justice as administered by the courts .
article 15 prohibits discrimination or disability in the matter of access to public places .
the concept embodied in our preamble is only that of equality of status and opportunity .
this has legal , social , political and economic aspects .
all citizens are equal before law and enjoy equal protection of the laws of the land .
all citizens are equally entitled to enjoy the political rights to vote and participate in the process of governance without any distinction .
in the economic field , equality means that for the same ability and same labour , the salary would also be the same .
also , one man or one class would not exploit other men or classes .
the concept of equality of status and opportunity has been given concrete substance and shape in articles 14 to 18 .
provisions relating to common citizenship are directed towards strengthening indian fraternal feelings and building a strong indian fellowship .
it goes beyond separation of religion and politics , freedom of religion , equal respect for all religions etc .
unfortunately , not enough importance has been attached by the jurists and judges to this concept .
speaking on the need for the recognition of the principle of fraternity , dr .
ambedkar remarked in the constituent assembly :
this has been elaborated in article 51 of the constitution under the directive principles .
the princely states with legislatures were put in part b which listed five states .
part c included five centrally administered states .
the territory of andaman and nicobar islands was mentioned in part d .
andhra was created as a separate state on linguistic basis by the andhra act , 1953 .
from a positivistic point of view , equality is antithetic to arbitrariness .
one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other , to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch .
the doctrine of classification which is evolved by the courts is not paraphrase of article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that article .
( dwarka prasad lakshmi narain v . state of u . p . , air 1954 sc 224 , 227 ) .
the restrictions imposed in carrying out the directive principles of state policy have been held to be in favour of their reasonableness ( state of bombay v . f .
freedom of speech and expression freedom of speech and expression is a sine qua non of the functioning of a democratic polity .
( romesh thapar v . state of madras , air 1950 sc 124 , 128 ) .
the diary has some amusing descriptions of the passengers trying to kill time with merry - making .
his eyes too must have wandered , or else how could he have noticed ?
ten years earlier he had said in a song : " they call you mad .
wait for tomorrow and keep silent .
they will bring their wreath . "
the tomorrow took a long time to come .
there are only four chapters and four characters in the book one of whom tells the story .
then to its genius for work will be added the materials to work with .
tagore stayed in japan for a little over three months , visiting several places .
all the poems of theirs that i have hitherto heard are picture - poems , not song - poems . "
it is independence of thought and action , not tutelage under european schoolmasters .
it is science but not its wrong application in life . "
but his words fell on deaf ears , for was he not the poet of a nation defeated and enslaved ?
in september 1916 tagore sailed for seattle .
the lectures delivered during this second visit to the united states were published in two volumes , nationalism and personality .
he terminated his contract for the lecture - tour prematurely and sailed for japan in january 1917 .
after a month ' s stay in japan on his way back , tagore returned to india in march 1917 .
he was once again being drawn into the political arena of which the stormy centre was no longer confined to bengal .
at a public meeting in calcutta he captured the hearts of his audience by singing a patriotic song freshly composed .
the political situation in the country was getting increasingly out of hand .
for lack of adequate constructive channels , the impetuosity of the bengali youth driven underground was exploding in terrorist activities .
the british government , now confident of victory in europe , retaliated brutally .
violence must be put down with greater violence , hatred met with greater hatred .
this age - old philosophy of power was working its havoc .
but occasions come when to remain in the shelter of one ' s own special vocation becomes a crying shame .
soon she returns home a widow and grows into an attractive woman .
the angry father is horrified at her wickedness and curses her .
the messenger of freedom will himself no longer be free .
he had won the world and the world in turn had won him .
he would now seek his home everywhere in the world and would bring - the world to his home .
on almost the same day three years later the university was formally inaugurated .
i am such a bird .
from time to time something calls me from beyond the ocean and my wings flutter .
he made an extensive tour of south india visiting several towns where he lectured on his educational ideals .
this period , 1917 - 19 , hectic with political and educational activities , was comparatively less crowded with new literary creations .
palataka has been referred to above .
the other volume , lipika , written in 1919 , is of an altogether different kind .
it consists of short pieces or sketches , some descriptive , some allegorical , some reflective , some satirical and some reminiscent .
they are written in prose , but a prose which has all the rhythm and music and elusive beauty of poetry .
the artist in him , too , looked for fresh pastures and newer modes of expression .
when the breasts of mother - earth dry up , all they can do is to cry .
as soon as the hunger is somewhat appeased , they forget everything else .
he had translated portions of these lectures into french and had used them in his articles during the war . .
her thought is in need of asia ' s thought , just as the latter has profited from con tact with europe ' s thought .
is that non - violence ? "
" tagore always looked upon gandhi as a saint , and i have often heard him speak of him with veneration .
obey without discussion the law of swadeshi , the first command of which is spin ! "
but give up your place in the ranks and go back to your poet ' s corner and be prepared to meet with ridicule and public disgrace . "
" my heart is starved , " he had wailed .
" day and night i dream of santiniketan which blossoms like a flower in the atmosphere of the unbounded freedom of simplicity . . .
his first practical experiments in this field were conducted for the benefit of the peasants on his family estates .
the peasants got loans at cheap interest and the school received a fixed annual income .
always seeking the great in the small , he found ample material in the lives of the common folk for his short stories .
while my companion was this eternal piper , this spirit of play , i was nearest to the heart of the world .
i knew its mother - tongue , and what i sang was caught up by the chorus of the wind and water and the dance - master of life .
" but now came the schoolmaster in the midst of my dreamworld , and i was foolish enough to accept his guidance .
i laid aside my reed , i left my playground , where the infinite child is spending his eternity ' in mere idle sport . '
in a moment i became old and carried the burden of wisdom on my back , hawking truths from door to door .
pushing the wheelbarrows of propaganda from continent to continentis this going to be the climax of a poet ' s life ?
so i founded my international universitya great work !
at such times he tended to be prolix , repetitive and stale .
the world had become his stage and santiniketan an ideal studio for rehearsals .
in july tagore presided at shelly centenary celebrations in calcutta .
the kingdom of yakshapuri flourishes on gold mining and forced labour .
in his name the police chief rules the land with a ruthless exercise of the whip and a judicious use of religious superstition .
it is the same cord , says a victim , that makes the whip and binds the rosary .
these poems were published in 1925 under the significant title , puravi , which is the name of a lovely evening melody .
the volume was dedicated to vijaya ( the sanskrit parallel of victoria ) by which name tagore used to address his hostess .
i have dedicated it to you though you will never be able to know what it contains .
laughing she came with her flowers of joy ; i had nought else but the fruit of my sorrow .
i asked her , " who will be the loser if we exchange what we have ? "
the glorious discovery was mutual .
soon after , in the beginning of the new year , he went to locknow to attend the all india music conference .
in the midst of the music festival came the news of the death of his eldest brother , dwijendranath , the gentle and amiable philosopher - mathematician .
" borodada ' s death , " commented the mahatma , " means the withdrawal of a great sage , philosopher and patriot from our midst . "
one day suddenly the stones felt the old familiar shiver of delight , which could only come from the tread of kusum ' s feet .
but there was no longer the same light music in her step .
kusum had returned to her villagea widow .
she gradually grew into a young and lovely woman , " as the ganges swells into beauty during the rains . "
one day a tall and handsome sanyasi arrived in the village and took up his abode in the siva temple near the ghat .
men and women of the village came to listen to his discourse , but kusum was not one of them .
recovering herself she pulled the veil down on her face and did obeisance to the sanyasi , who asked , " what is your name ? "
he embodied it in a song - and - dance sequence called nataraja riturangasala which was produced in santiniketan in february .
in march he went on anodier tour of western india during which he presided over a hindi literary conference held in die then princely state of bharatpur .
almost all the major novels of tagore depict the inevitable conflicts and contradictions of the indian ( chiefly hindus ) society in transition .
having given up the voyage , he was no longer restless and fretful .
the old poise returned and with it the creative mood .
this novel which is almost half poetry is very popular among bengali readers and stands in a class by itself .
dr sukumar sen describes it as " a love story written as if to end all love stories . "
he writes as one dedicated consciously and impelled subconsciously to a higher purpose .
not only angels and ariels but pucks and calibans too have their full play on his canvas .
in january 1930 tagore visited western india and gave lectures in baroda on . "
the paintings were well received by paris critics , who described them as " pure paintings , absolutely sincere and wholly uninfluenced by our studio customs . "
the hibbert lectures delivered in oxford later in the month were published in the following years as the religion of man , dedicated to dorothy elmhirst .
after an exhibition of his paintings in birmingham and london , tagore left for berlin in july .
his pictures were exhibited at gallery moller in berlin and a civic reception was accorded to him in the ancient town hall of munich .
he visited many places in germany , including oberammergau where he witnessed the passion play .
we have neither power nor wealth .
we belong to the hungry and the helpless under dog class of the world . "
he believed that inhumane means were capable of perverting the most humane ends .
he was by no means a blind admirer of whatever he saw in the soviet union .
he was aware of the ruthless nature of the party dictatorship and of the many moral limitations of the soviet experiment .
but these limitations did not make him lose his perspective and miss the wood for the trees .
the mahatma could rise above the limitation of his own biases but would his followers do so ?
how far his misgivings were justified may be left to the verdict of history .
two years ago i went a step further and said that truth is god . "
on 26 january he issued a statement which the government censorship or press did not allow to be fully published .
these were later published as vickitrita ( variegated ) and dedicated to the artist nandalal bose .
age and claims of a strenuous life were telling on tagore ' s health and his straight back and stately shoulders were getting bent .
to avoid the strain of a long and arduous journey they travelled by air .
oh that i were a bedouin ! he had exclaimed in one of his early poems .
tragic news awaited him on his return from the land of roses and nightingales .
nitindra died in germany on 7 august .
the death of his only grandson in a far - away land was a severe blow .
but the poet had known many bereavements , and from each great sorrow he had emerged more chastened in spirit and firmer in his faith in life .
" from afar you seemed terrible and invincible in your pitiless majesty , " he wrote in a fine poem .
" with trembling heart i stood before you , in dread of your ominous frown .
ceasing to wander he could now dive deeper than ever and get his pearl .
many discerning bengali critics believe that tagore ' s greatest poetry was written in the last decade of his life .
this may or may not be so , depending on the reader ' s mood , taste and personal predilection .
i enter the fiery gate at noon .
if you can bless the effort i want it .
it was indeed a fruitful year in literary activity , despite the many distractions of public engagements and political happenings .
it is as if the author is trying to show that a man seeks in woman both mother and sweetheart .
lucky the man who can find both in one .
a heart that is alive cannot escape frustration .
the situation in this novel is further complicated by the two rivals being sisters , both of them equally admirable , each in her fashion .
malancha is shorter in length but more dramatic in situation .
the novel is mostly in dialogue and one wonders why the author did not write it as a play .
the psychological interest of this novel is , however , of a different nature .
niraja was happily married to a florist who was passionately devoted to his nursery garden .
she grew to share this devotion - in the usual feminine way , for only by sharing his interests could she possess her husband fully .
the husband doted on her and then happiness was the envy of friends .
because she was happy she was generous .
she could only watch from a window by her bed the scene of her past happiness .
it is all the more unfortunate because this kind of unscientific view of phenomenon is too readily accepted by a large section of our countrymen . "
" we do not know the laws of god nor their working . "
he was ageing and was no longer able to travel as he would have wished to .
more harassing than the problem of age was that of money .
by 1934 tagore had become in the west more a memory than a living voice and his royalties had considerably dwindled .
one day the postmaster took to bed with a severe bout of malaria .
day and night the little girl watched by his bedside and nursed him back to health .
it was during his stay in ceylon that tagore completed what was to be his last novel , char adhyay ( four chapters ) .
this love is a recurrent theme in all his writings spread over a period of more than six decades .
this earth i loved .
midst its hungers and thirsts , i ' ve tasted its nectar .
in its dust i found my true fulfilment , and among the dishonoured the degraded my liberation . "
this wisdom , such at it was , came to him through sorrow .
this wisdom was primarily of the heart and not of the head , much less the wisdom gleaned from scripture and philosophy .
in one of the poems of punascha he tells an anecdote which well illustrates his characteristic feeling and attitude .
shankarlal was a learned court pandit renowned for his erudition and power of debate .
i asked , " is he no where then ? "
there was a soft whisper : " he is there where i am .
many of the poems in these two volumes are exceedingly beautiful and in them tagore ' s power of expression is at its best .
for him the primal mystery of creation is in the eflgence of light and its final mystery in the nectar of love .
this form was his oldest love and he reverts to it again and again , whatever his experiments and explorations of other modes .
some of the poems are very beautiful and as usual represent a large variety of themes and moods .
he can only console himself . " it is there and yet not there , and so there is no burden .
one has to do without it and there in lies its value . "
but there is a real passion of grief in one poem addressed to " ourbhagini " , file ill - fated one .
it is dated 6 august 1932 .
the poet ' s only surviving daughter was in germany by the bedside of her only son who died the following day .
unable to travel about freely , the poet took to changing his dwelling place , from house to house .
it was not only that the public clamoured for his appearance on the stage ; he also loved to act .
it was successfully staged in calcutta , winning high praise , and was then taken by the poet on a tour of north india .
after earning more applause than money in several big towns , it was staged in delhi in the last week of march .
" now , " wrote the mahatma , " you will relieve the public mind by announcing cancellation of the rest of the programme . "
returning from delhi tagore did not sit back and relax , as the mahatma would have wished him to do .
he continued to preside over public meetings in calcuttaa much greater strain than watching his own dramas .
this was staged in calcutta later in the month , the author , as usual , present on the stage .
the moral law working through him brings the nemesis , the inevitable retribution , to the unfortunate syama , so devoted to her lover , so guilty to humanity .
it was also the first occasion when the address was delivered in bengali , and no in english .
tagore used the occasion for a magnificent plea for the use of the mother tongue as the medium of education .
tagore had no academic education in science or for that matter in any other discipline .
the very first jingle he had learnt as a child was the bengali nursery rhyme , " the rain patters , the leaf quivers . . . "
the verbal jingle as well as nature ' s jingle as the rain patters and the leaf quivers had never ceased to delight his ear .
the autumn , with its clear , rain - washed sky and stray clouds " floating uselessly " was also a season very dear to him .
but the autumn of 1937 had a grim experience in store for him .
on - the evening of 10 september , as he was seated in his usual chair , he suddenly lost consciousness .
there was no telephone at santiniketan in those days and it took time before the message for medical aid could reach calcutta .
meanwhile the unconscious poet hovered between life and death .
fortunately he recovered his consciousness and was gradually restored to normal health .
tagore was provoked to reply : " you are building your conception of an asia which would be raised on a tower of skulls .
one night i dreamt a strange dream . binu was calling to me , " wake up . and see what is happening . "
i sat up and saw calcutta shuffling along with uncertain steps as thousands of beams and rafters knocked against one another .
the brick - built houses marched ahead like rhinos , while doors and windows banged and clanged .
the shops and markets bobbed up and down while roofs hit one another on the head in a drunken orgy .
the howrah bridge crawled like a giant scorpion and harrison road trailed behind .
the monument reeled , as if a mad elephant was waving its trunk in the air .
not much was left of the old familiar joy living .
many of the poems are thus reminiscent , but they are free of morbidity or self - pity of any kind .
he is sipping his morning cup of tea in the month of chaitra when the mango trees begin to bear fruit .
so he would patiently wait until a strong gust of wind brought the unripe mangoes down .
the first time he took them to her , she said , " who asked you to bring them ?
another day , while picking them , he was stung by a bee .
this mockery he brings out in a dramatic and startling fashion in a poem he wrote in kalimpong in the summer of 1940 .
the first world war of 1914 had caused him great agony and had hustled him in to the public arena to preach the message of peace .
the year 1940 began auspiciously as well as ominously .
sir maurice gwyer , then chief justice of india , dr radhakrishnan and mr justice hendersen of the calcutta high court represented the oxford university .
" the university whose representative i am , " said sir maurice gwyer , " has , in honouring you , done honour to itself . "
twenty - eight years earlier the same university had declined to recognise the indian poet .
to quote rothenstein : " fox - strangways wanted oxford or cambridge to give tagore an honorary degree .
lord curzon , when consulted , said that there were more distinguished men in india than tagore .
tagore the perfectionist was never content with perfection if it became static , for then , according to him , it ceased to be perfection .
in fact , he was disconsolate if no music came .
poetry was his oldest love and whatever his " dates " with other muses , to this one he constantly came back .
during the seven years from 1894 to 1900 he published as many major volumes of verse , besides several of drama , stories and other prose writing .
the first of these volumes of poetry is sonar tori ( the golden boat ) , taking its name from the first poem in the book .
on a rainy day , when the clouds thunder in the sky , the poet is sitting desolate on the edge of his field overlooking . the river .
the golden boat approaches and he dimly recognises the figure at the helm .
the hypaethral temples the worship of trees as the abode of spirits and gods was once very popular .
the kadamba tree is said to be the abode of murugan ( kartikeya ) , and the ai ( banyan ) that of siva .
this would appear to be an instance of a tree - temple or vriksha - chaitya that was not particularly buddhistic .
even during subsequent renovations the sculptors devoted greater attention to the ayaka platform , as in the case of other stupas elsewhere .
these slabs were morticed between uprights placed at intervals over the outer circumference with a running moulded coping on top .
this was done during the the large maha - chaitya of nagarjunakonda , built early in ikshvaku times , belongs to the class of uncased stupas .
its brickwork has been mostly plastered over , and the anda decorated by an immense garland ornament in stuccco .
it probably also had an outer circular railing .
a stone could be a hero , a warrior , a king , or even an ordinary person .
these are also common in the kannada country and across the borders in the peripheral regions of the tamil country from the fourth century onwards .
the epic manimekalai speaks of temples built of brick and having imposing entrances or gopuras .
such gods were seyon , mayon , vendan , valiyon , korravai or kadukal .
there is a lovely and moving poem entitled , " i will not let you go . "
these simple words wrung out of the infant ' s heart sum up for the poet the perennial pathos of life .
much as these poems glow with passion , it is passion suffused with thought and subdued by reflection .
many bengali readers would consider this volume as the finest fruition of tagore ' s poetical genius .
the cornice moulding ( kapota ) and the clerestory - like griva as well as the blunted ridge of the sikhara shows a backward slope .
the ter temple now containing a trivikrama image shows more advanced features .
this mode is called kadalika karana in indian silpa parlance .
both the modes are found developed in the later cave - temples of the chalukyas , pallavas , pandyas , and other contemporary dynasties of the south .
caves 4 and from 6 to 10 are assignable to the sixth - seventh centuries ad .
caves 11 and 12 , which are unique , belong to the seventh century ad .
in contrast cave 1 in the first series is simple and perhaps an experimental excavation .
the shrine of cave 2 has two lateral cells with an ante - chamber or ardha - mandapa .
there are monastic cells on the lateral walls of the mandapa of cave 3 .
cave 4 is two - storeyed .
cave 8 has again a large hall with three monk - cells on the north wall .
on the north wall of the pradakshina - patha there are monastic cells .
cave 6 as usual has a verandah and a hall behind , having a lateral hall on the south with six cells .
cave 10 ( visvakarma ) is a large chaitya similar to those at ajanta with pillars and aisles and balconies in front of the arch opening .
the drum of the stupa has twelve panels all round , ten of which contain miniature buddhas .
the arch on the facade is very elaborate and different in design from that found in ajanta and elsewhere .
its trefoil arches , and the udgamas and the amalakas , recall similar motifs characteristic of contemporary and later brahmanical temples in the northern style .
a similar rock - cut cave excavation , now called anantasayanagudi in undavalli on the south bank of the krishna , also belongs to this class .
what was even more significant was that it was a departure from the process known till then of excavating into deliberately chosen soft rocks .
this was followed by more cave - temples being excavated by him into the hard rocks of the south .
thus one may say that the chalukyas and the pallavas inaugurated two parallel traditions in the south .
the faces of the square sections of the pillars are adorned with large , circular lotus medallions often inscribed inside a square .
where there are no inner pillars , the differentiation is indicated by the varying floor - levels or ceiling heights .
the door - frame , if distinct , is again simple and unadorned .
the pilasters carry in some cases distinct capital mouldings and corbels , or potika , on top .
the kapota is adorned by semi - circular kudu ornaments , with a flat shovel - shaped finial above .
the shrine doors are generally guarded by relief sculptures of two armed dvarapalas , or gatekeepers , one on each side .
these mahendra temples are noted also for the absence of other kinds of sculpture even in the mandapa part , except those of the dvarapalas .
its back wall has two moreone on either side of the projected shrine entrance , carrying panels of gajalakshmi and durga .
the central shrine is now empty , butperhaps once contained painted or stucco representation of narasimha .
the niches flanking the entrance contain dvarapalas .
the south and north walls of the mukha - mandapa contain large reliefs of standing brahma , and siva as gangadhara .
the main sanctum contains a modern stucco form of varaha murti .
this temple is in use for worship while others are not .
the back wall of the central shrine retains traces of a somaskanda group .
the whole structure is surrounded by an arched frieze of eleven large vyala heads mistakenly called ' tiger heads ' .
the yali mandapam obviously served as resting - place of the processional idols or the royalty during festivals .
this , even the name of the place tiruveluchchiyur found in the inscriptions , would suggest .
a smaller replica of the yali mandapam is found on the surf - beaten boulder to the south of the shore temple in mahabalipuram .
they are arjuna ' s penance and the govardhana - krishna scenes .
" how sweet it was when she gave those flowers with her hand !
" in another he regrets that he could achieve nothing .
" the vina was in my hand , the music was in my mindwho knew that half way through the music , the string would break ! "
these would indicate a similarity of origin , namely , pandya , and a proximity of date .
the siva cave - temple called vagisvaram at malai - yadippatti was excavated by vidalvidugu muttaraiyar in the sixteenth year of pallava dantivarman .
the adjoining vishnu cave - temple of a later date was also perhaps a muttaraiyar excavation .
these are examples of typical cave - temple pattern with cell and front mandapa .
the linga - pitha is often a structural addition , though monolithic examples cut out of the same rock as the cave itself are known .
in ailurpara and bhutapandi , the linga is an integral part of the cave and is rock - cut as in the pandya - muttaraiyar examples .
he naturalised this form in bengali and achieved amazing results with it .
sukra , the teacher of the titans , knew the secret of immortality and could restore the dead to life .
the gods , anxious to learn the secret , send kacha , the young son of their teacher , to sukra to be his pupil .
having completed his course of study and learnt the art of reviving the dead , kacha comes to devayani to bid her farewell .
this is the starting point of this short drama which consists entirely the dialogue between the two .
" so you ' ve at last attained , " says devayani , " what you had hardly hoped for .
the knowledge coveted by the gods is now yours .
the spout projects invariably northwards irrespective of the direction of the sanctum .
in cases where the sanctum itself faces north , the alternate agamic injunction that it should be on the proper left is adhered to .
did you share the vast dumb love the earth feels for her children , the patience and pain of the silent nourisher of mankind ?
it is compact and has a terminal nandi pavilion and contains a very rich grouping of sculptures of great icono - graphic value .
the ganeshlena constitutes over a score of cave - temples forming a group collectively numbered as cave 21 .
the rear wall of the shrine has a relief of mahesamurti .
these may be placed just about ad 750 , in the early years of the rashtrakuta rule in ellora .
in the earlier western chalukyan caves as at badami , vishnu and siva sculptures occur indiscriminately , while in the later ones they are well - nigh separated .
the former type of caves show among the female deities only durga , while the latter have the saptamatrikas , sarasvati , gajalakshmi and parvati .
the profusion of such didactic depictions compensates richly for the diminution of the aesthetic trends of the earlier phase .
they are monolithic and form part of the live rock of the excavation .
the chalukya - rashtrakuta lingas are of a different type .
it is only in the monolithic linga - pitha and linga of the pandyan temples that we find square , circular , and even octagonal linga - pithas .
here memory broods and pines in the deserted nook of departed joy .
go and waste no more of your time here . "
kacha tries to pacify and assure her that the happy memories of the days spent in the hermitage would always haunt him .
if knowledge it was you were after , why need you have ensnared in your coils this simple - hearted maiden ?
or was it all a well - planned strategy to win access to my father ' s favour ? "
the earlier practice was to have painted stucco forms of the principal deity inside the sanctum .
it is not the superstructure over the sanctum alone , as is often assumed by many writers and in a few later texts .
it has often a small vestibule in front called the ardha - mandapa or antarala , standing on the same basement , or adhishthana .
the one which is circular , ellipsoidal or apsidal from base to top , or has such a plan in its griva and sikhara , is vesara .
likewise , the oblong body may carry an elliptical griva and sikhara , which would make the vimana vesara again .
it comes in the category of panjaras or nidas ,
in the chalukya - rashtrakuta series in the deccan and in those that took after them and succeeded them , the mandapa is of two patterns .
all this resulted in such multi - pillared mandapas as the hundred - or thousand - pillared halls .
the talachchanda , or system of storeys , with hara components at each level , is much akin to that of the oblong or ayatasra vimana .
thus these stone replicas would afford a good starting point for the study of the south indian temple architecture .
the reproduction of the parts of the wooden original is quite obvious .
as in all the above cases , the hara is extended over the mandapa .
the octagonal griva sikhara region has four projected nasikas on the four cardinal sides .
the top of the mandapa is more or less flat with a large multi - petalled lotus surrounding the base of the finial cut over its centre .
the principal vimana is four - storeyed ( chatushtala ) .
though the talas are square , the griva and sikhara are octagonal , making the vimana conform to the dravida class of the mixed type .
the stupi , now missing , was not part of the monolith .
the walls are plain , the pilasters simple , crudely shaped and devoid of vyala bases .
the cells of these abutting vimanas in their ground storeys enshrine forms of siva .
thus the panamalai temple painted fragment , mentioned earlier , would alone be the earliest pallava painting extant as found so far .
the kutas , salas and panjaras of each tier crown the correspondingly relieved bays and recesses of the walls .
the bays and recesses of the upper tala outer walls have similar sculpture , all vaishnavite .
the lowermost storey and the ardha - mandapa in front are surrounded by an open narrow circuit at the level of the base of the adhishthana .
this arrangement when viewed from outside would simulate a pancha - tala appearance , as in the case of the shore temple described earlier .
the other temples of this period to be found in kanchi , though smaller in proportions , are interesting for their architecture and iconography .
the superstructure of the airavatesvara is lost .
the kailasanatha at tiruppattur ( tiruchirapalli district ) is a larger vimana in sandstone and is much like the kailasanatha of kanchi .
it is of the late eighth century and is an example of the provincial variety of the pallava vimana .
the ruined softstone - built temples at hemavati ( anantapur district ) , noted for their fine sculpture , are examples of pure nolamba architecture and art .
in all of them the native soft sandstone of fine grain and quality which was most easily tractable has been used .
the central bay at the rear end with a slopy roof is converted into a shrine chamber with a plinth and slab walls .
over the central clerestory has been constructed an upper cell of heavy slabs with flat roof .
the present stone temple , of a later date than the pillar , could have replaced an earlier brick structure that had the inscribed pillar in front of it .
the mallikarjuna has a circular griva and sikhara over - topping the square talas , and is hence of the vesara order .
an open - pillared porch is attached to the middle of the northern side of the maha - mandapa .
the exterior of this wall relieved and recessed alternately has a series of devakoshthas in the bays containing sculptures of deities of varied iconography .
over them the hara part carries incipient panjaras , perhaps the first appearance of this third characteristic member in the vimanas of the chalukyas and their derivatives .
the chapa ends of the inner wall of the aditala are turned in to form the narrow front entrance of the antamla - mandapa .
its original dedication is uncertain .
the name durga for the temple is misleading since it was evidently not dedicated to that goddess .
it is essentially a three - storeyed sandhara vimana , square on plan from its base to sikhara , the two lower storeys being functional .
the measurements of lands endowed are given to the fraction of units .
all these would only show how meticulous the emperor was in matters relating to his great temple .
all these are later additions to this complex , the last one pertaining to the nayaka period .
this temple complex had only two entrances , a gopura ( now shattered ) on the east and a plain double - storeyed torana gate on the north .
this temple too is a veritable museum of sculptures of varied iconography that include some fine dance poses .
for example , there is a visalakshi temple built by the tamils for the consort of lord visvesvara at kasi - varanasi .
the temple unit in general consists of a vimana connected by its short antarala to a closed navaranga which may often be proceeded by another mandapa .
this star - shaped external configuration is made to extend from the upa - pitha to the apex of the vimana superstructure .
this , incidentally , provided a larger surface area for the execution of the cloyingly prolific sculpture and carving for which the hoysala temples are noted .
the middle of the front face of the upper talas is drawn forward into a sukanasika over the antarala below .
each unit consists of a vimana of a star - shaped plan with antarala and navaranga in front , facing east .
the adhishthanas of both the units are made up of elaborate animal or narrative friezes forming their respective tiers .
the walls of the vimana , the inter - connecting transept , and the walls of the mandapas are covered externally with large sculptural reliefs of remarkable fineness .
the entrances of the porches , the antarala and the shrine chamber are framed by elaborately carved over - doors , with elegant makara torana lintels on top .
the upa - pitha platform provides a broad open circumambulatory round both the units .
the kesava temple , somnathpur , is a fine example of one of the latest in the series of hoysala creations .
it was built in 1268 by somanatha , a general of the hoysala king .
this axial series is surrounded by an open court with a peripheral cloister of sixty - four shrines inside the prakara wall .
the shrines are ranged on the rear half of the cloister close to the prakara , while the anterior half forms a continuous corridor with a pillared facade .
the wall niches have boldly moulded figure sculptures of gods and goddesses .
the pillars inside the mandapa are all finely lathe - turned with gracefully carved mouldings .
the main temple of the group constructed in 1215 stands on a high platform , with a nandi - mandapa in front .
it is enclosed by a massive wall .
the griva too is abbreviated and less distinct and almost of the same width as the domical sikhara .
the entire superstructure is of brickwork .
twelve of these are almost life - size figures of slender build and in graceful poses .
the rest are rearing vyalas , their hind legs resting on elephant heads .
one of the units is at pillalamarri .
typically the vimana is connected by an antarala to a frontal mandapa with three porch entrances on the other three sides .
these should have helped the vijayanagar craftsmen guilds even in their initial achievement which was considerable enough after the stagnation that ensued due to the invasions and upheayals .
( k . a . n . sastry , a history of south india , third edition , madras , 1966 , p . 452 ) .
the eastern doorway forms the principal entrance .
this is an imitation in the hardstone of what the hoysala predecessors could do in their softstone fabric .
this delicate imitation is to be seen in the kapotas of numerous vijayanagar structures as for example in the famous kalyana - mandapa of the varadaraja temple in kanchipuram .
the inner wall of the rear apse encloses the sanctum or the garbha - griha enshrining the principal vidyasankara linga with a narrow antarala in front .
on either side of the antarala and with door - openings facing east in line with that of the antarala are two cells , one on each side .
the one on the south enshrines ganapati , while the other on the north enshrines durga , as had become the norm from the chalukyan times .
thus the grouping round the main sanctum forms a panchayatana complex of five subsidiary shrines hugging close on to the sanctum sanctorum .
the antrala front has two dvarapalas , one of which , curiously enough , is hanuman while the other is sage bhiringi .
the vimana superstructure of brick has a prominent sukanasika .
there is an amman shrine vimana to its north , also of the same type .
its agra - mandapa of the vijayanagar period is noted for its sculptured columns and contemporary ceiling paintings .
the hollow , tall , main , east gopura , built of brick in the corbelled fashion is one of the largest vijayanagar gopuras .
it is located inside the fifth south prakara , west of the utsava - mandapam , called locally ranga - mandapam .
the top is crowned by a griva , amalasila , and stupi , as is usual in northern prasadas .
similar temples are to be found at terala near nagarjunakonda ( guntur district ) .
this type became more common in the northern territories of the vijayanagar empire , as at hampi .
the prastara and griva below the ultimate roof are eliminated .
the usual plan for the snkoyil or vimana is the square or the circle and the apsidal .
the rectangle is more common for the mandapas and gopuras which are called padi - p - pura .
the rafters of the roof project beyond the wall , forming well - formed eaves - like kapotas .
these are often additionally supported by a carved wooden frame - work with carved wooden brackets sprung from the walls , caryatid - like .
this , because the respective chadyas emerge from what would otherwise be the kapota tier of the tala prastara in a southern vimana prototype .
the actual water - proof covering is laid over the planking in the form of clinker tiles , or metal sheeting ( copper or brass ) .
the sikhara roof has four nasikas , or dormers at the middle of its four sides .
there is also a smaller shrine for ganapati , interposed between the siva and harihara temples .
the taliparambha temple is almost similar , quadrangular on plan and double - walled , with the roof in two storeys .
the lower pent roof slopes down on the top of the shorter outer wall and the upper pyramidal or kuta roof cap the top of the inner walls .
in front there is the namaskara - mandapa with a sloped roof and two projecting gables at either end .
the decayed temple at tiruprangode , and the one at tiruvannur near kozhikode , are yet other examples of the same class .
the bhagavati or durga temple at kodungallur of ancient fame is now a total modern renovation , of course in the indigenous style .
abu zafar , son of king akbar ii of delhi , was the last ruler of the mughal dynasty founded by babur in 1526 .
on ascending the throne in 1837 , he assumed the name of abu zafar muhammad sarajuddin bahadur shah ghazi .
little is known of abu zafar ' s childhood .
even his place of birth is shrouded in mystery .
in these he acquired considerable skill and was reputed to be an excellent marksman and one of the best horsemen in the country .
the ' ghazals ' he composed during his period of exile deserve a place in literature because of their emotional and musical content .
he was not addicted to alcohol or tobacco but in the matter of food he was a gourmet .
he married several times and had the usual complement of concubines , slave girls and mistresses .
his favourite wife was zeenat mahal whom he married late in life and who shared the misfortunes of his last years in exile .
bahadur shah was 82 - years - old when the disturbances of 1857 took place .
he was subsequently tried by a military court on charges of treason , conspiracy , rebellion and murder .
the evidence produced at the trial was for the most part irrelevant and inadmissible by law , but bahadur shah was convicted upon all charges and exiled to rangoon .
his trial and conviction were clearly a travesty of justice and in the nature of a reprisal .
that trial put a final end to a chapter of india ' s history . "
he was referring to the trial of bahadur shah zafar , the last king from the imperial house of taimur .
they could , at will , put on throne or dethrone any prince or king in any part of india .
he was given an undignified seat near the president .
his loyal servant stood behind him and jawan bakht to his left .
he rested on a pile of cushions on the floor .
the british government wanted to crush freedom of speech and expression . any organised attempt to overthrow british rule was to be suppressed ruthlessly .
lord curzon ' s partition of bengal in 1905 led to violent protests in bengal and all over the country .
violent and non - violent means were adopted to register protest .
the explosion of a bomb at muzaffarpur in bihar in which two british women were killed was followed by ruthless repression on an unprecedented scale .
innocent people were shot , arrested , jailed and tortured by the british rulers .
in the meantime he had been elevated to the bench and he ceased to be an advocate for a cause but a judge of the british court .
as bacon has observed , " when an advocate sits in a judge ' s place he is another man . "
mr justice davar of 1908 was a man totally different to the barrister davar , who had defended tilak in 1897 .
there was a general atmosphere of fear .
tilak could not employ a senior lawyer for his defence , neither did any come forward to defend him .
in such a situation tilak had no alternative but to conduct his own defence .
out of the nine members of the special jury , six were europeans , two parsis and one jew .
" and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 124 - a of the indian penal code and within the cognisance of the high court .
" and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 153 - a of the indian penal code and within the cognisance of the high court .
case no . 17
" and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 124 - a of the indian penal code and within the cognisance of the high court .
" and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 153 - a of the indian penal code and within the cognisance of the high court .
i wanted to bring the matter to his lordship ' s notice but i thought it was a small matter .
gentlemen of the jury , you will have to leave all that out of our consideration .
i know that there are certain prejudices against me .
i request you to keep aside those prejudices .
judge me on facts . one reason i undertook to defend myself was that you would know the man .
i have told you , perhaps bluntly , what i have done .
but i believe , nay i am confident , you will find nothing in it against me .
you will , after taking all the circumstances into consideration , return a verdict of ' not guilty ' .
it was nearly 8 p . m . when the judge finished his summing up .
apply your minds entirely to the articles before you and tell me , gentlemen , what is your verdict upon the charges .
there are three charges : you are at liberty to acquit or convict on all three or acquit or convict on any two of the charges .
the extremists , who were also known as the nationalists , formed a very distinct group .
this was the origin of the swadeshi movement which was also known as the boycott movement .
pyres of foreign articles and clothes were lit in every part of india and picketing of shops selling foreign goods was seen everywhere .
the government took vigorous steps to close newspapers , prosecute publishers , writers and editors and arrested many young people in bengal .
kingsford was transferred to muzaffarpur , now in bihar , as the district judge .
the revolutionaries deputed two young men , khudiram bose and prafulla chaki , from calcutta to muzaffarpur .
this was rich food for his poetry .
as they were not intended for publication he wrote freely and without any self - consciousness .
after that i gave up my studies and went to baroda where my brother , aurobindo ghose , was a professor at the gaekwar ' s college .
there i devoted myself to the study of history and political literature .
after being there for a year i came back to bengal with the idea of preaching the cause of independence as a political missionary .
by that time i had been through almost all the districts of bengal .
i had an idea of starting a religious institution .
by that time the swadeshi and boycott agitation had begun .
i thought of taking men under my own instructions to teach them and so i began to collect this band which has been arrested .
all these , objections were overruled and mr e . norton opened the case for the crown which took him six days .
in all , 206 witnesses were examined on behalf of the crown and a large number of exhibits were produced .
mr norton then began his argument which he finished on the 20th march .
the defence counsel and pleaders then addressed the court .
mr c . r . das pleaded for aurobindo for eight days .
long after he is dead and gone , his words will be echoed and re - echoed not only in india but across distant seas and lands .
after the arguments of the other defence counsel , the judgment was delivered on 6th may , 1909 .
the learned sessions judge passed the sentence :
the properties of all the accused will be forfeited to the government .
asoke chandra nandy , balakrishna hard kane , sushil kumar sen are sentenced to transportation for seven years .
krishna jibon sanyal is sentenced to one year ' s rigorous imprisonment under section 121 - a .
the rest of the accused are acquitted and to be set at liberty .
send the record to the high court for confirmation of the sentence of death . "
while commenting on the trial , the chief prosecutor , eardley norton said , " the ring - leader was a young man of unusual qualities .
his holograph confession sought to take the whole blame to himself and to exonerate his colleagues .
for eight days he pleaded for his clients with great skill and persuasiveness .
barindra kumar and ullaskar had been charged with the offences under sections 121 , 121 - a , 122 and 123 of the indian penal code .
for prosecution under these sections , he said , " it is absolutely necessary to have the sanction of the government under section 196 of the criminal procedure code .
complaints under these sections can be made only on the basis of that sanction . "
there was thus no sanction for prosecution under this section nor could there be any valid complaint in the circumstances .
the judges accepted the cogency of das ' s argument and dropped the charge under section 121 .
he had been the head of st . paul ' s and won a scholarship at king ' s college , cambridge .
both won honours at the university and at the final examination for the indian civil service .
aurobindo , the prisoner , beat beachcroft , the judge , in greek . 5 .
he set up an ashram to work out spiritual salvation for himself and others .
vinayak passed the marathi fourth standard at the age of ten .
he joined the shivaji high school at nasik in 1895 and passed the matriculation examination in 1901 .
at eighteen he topped in an essay competition on ' who was the best of the peshwas ? '
he was sentenced to two consecutive life - transportations , which meant fifty years .
his property was confiscated .
in the an - damans , he composed his poem ' kamala ' in a special blank verse which he named vinayak vritta .
he also composed the poem ' saptarshi ' on his first night in jail and ' virahocchvasa ' depicting his yearning for the motherland .
on being released , he published the story of his life in the andamans in ' mazi fan - mathep ' ( my transportation ) .
in 1937 , he was elected president of the hindu mahasabha at ahmedabad .
after 1943 , savarkar led a retired life and died in 1966 , in his home at bombay .
in a bid to throttle his voice ' and put a stop to his activities , a dubious method was devised by the british .
savarkar , who had gone to england as a student on a regular passport granted by the indian government , was charged under the fugitive offenders act , 1881 .
waging war or abetting the waging of war against his majesty the king emperor of india .
conspiring to deprive his majesty the king of the sovereignty of british india or a part of it .
procuring and distributing arms and abetting the murder of jackson .
he was arrested in england in 1910 for the speeches said to have been made in india in 1906 .
he was produced at the bow street police court on 14th march , 1910 .
mr vaughan , counsel for savarkar , made an application for a writ of habeas corpus and also appealed against the decision of the bow street court .
the habeas corpus application and appeal were heard on 2nd and 3rd june , 1910 by the divisional court .
the presiding judge upheld the decision of the bow street court and rejected the petition and the appeal .
justice coleridge , who was in minority , dissented and held that savarkar should not be sent to india but the majority view affirmed his transportation to india .
savarkar was kept in custody till july , 1910 in the british jail while preparations were being made in india to start proceedings against him .
this objection was overruled .
on the 27th and 28th september , the advocate general continued his speech .
after two prosecution witnesses had been examined , the court asked savarkar to cross - examine them if he so desired .
savarkar ' s counsel , mr baptista , also raised the point that savarkar ' s arrest on french soil was illegal .
the court overruled all objections on 1st october , 1910 .
the provisions of the extradition act were discussed .
when asked to comment by the court , savarkar refused to say anything on the point .
he was kept in a solitary cell ; but neither did he loose his self - control nor was his spirit dampened .
after some time , the entire nation clamoured for savarkar ' s release . it became difficult for the government to resist the demand .
he was brought to india after the termination of the first world war in 1921 and kept at yervada jail .
in 1923 , the indian national congress at its kakinada session passed a resolution demanding the release of savarkar .
some ray of hope was seen .
after substituting a few words , savarkar accepted the conditions , signed the terms and was released conditionally on 6th january , 1924 from the yervada jail .
on the following morning , between the 6th and 7th , savarkar swam ashore and then began to run .
three persons who had come ashore from the vessel assisted the brigadier in taking the fugitive back .
on july 9th , the " s . s . morea " left marseilles with sarvarkar on board .
" it appears that the brigadier saw the fugitive throw himself into the sea and swim to the quay .
at the same moment , some persons from the ship , who were shouting and gesticulating , rushed ashore in order to pursue him .
a number of people on the quay commenced to shout , ' arretezle ' .
the brigadier arrested the fugitive after a pursuit of 500 metres .
on his own initiative and quite unexpectedly , mahatma gandhi visited the meerut jail on 27th october , 1929 to meet the communist undertrials in their barracks .
he spent almost two hours with the prisoners and told them :
on 21st march , jawahar lal nehru issued a statement describing the arrests as ' primarily directed against the labour movement and the youth league ' .
he claimed that the government wanted to ' strike terror ' by these arrests and searches .
he also sought to raise funds for the accused and international sympathy and support .
the accused were held in meerut jail by the local police , who took remand from time to time at the expiry of every two weeks .
preliminary enquiry the preliminary enquiry began on 12th june , 1927 almost eleven weeks after the arrests .
four months after the death of his daughter renuka , the poet suffered another grievous bereavement .
the whole school had to be shifted to shelidah for the time being , for fear of the epidemic .
soon after , his father , the maharshi , passed away on 19 january 1905 , aged eighty - eight .
henceforth political ends and not moral or intellectual ideals will dominate the indian scene , despite the great dreams of a gandhi or a tagore .
they had newspapers everlastingly preaching the gospel of communism and their activities consisted in poisoning the minds of the youths in the country by the formation of youth leagues .
only three of the accused made specific statements in their own defence .
dr r . thengdi , president of the bombay workers ' and peasants ' party had died during the trial .
the remaining twenty - seven persons were found guilty and were meted out harsh sentences varying from three years to life sentence .
muzaffar ahmad was the one to be sentenced to transportation for life .
appeals all the convicts appealed officially before the high court of judicature at allahabad on 24th july , 1933 .
the high court judgment had divided the twenty - seven accused into four groups for the sake of convenience :
it was estimated that the government paid to mr james a sum of rs 34,000 per month , which was a stupendous amount in 1930 .
in march , 1929 , the british government dealt another blow to the freedom fighters when trade union leaders were arrested without any cause .
among the arrested were prominent labour leaders like s . a . dange , muzaffar ahmad , s . v . ghate and 29 others .
bhagat singh and b . k . dutt , dressed in khaki shirts and shorts , entered unobserved and sat quietly in the visitors ' gallery .
a bomb or some explosive had fallen in the central hall ; the house was plunged into darkness .
thunder and smoke , shrieks and cries led to more confusion and chaos all round .
members rushed out , visitiors dashed to safety and women ran for protection .
then two pistol shots were heard .
in these circumstances , these youths must not be allowed to lead to the infliction of an inadequate punishment .
i sentence bhagat singh and b . k . dutt to transportation for life . "
the appeal was heard by justice ford and justice addison .
asaf ah argued it for two - and - a - half days .
the public prosecutor replied to his arguments during the remaining half of the third day .
but in between , as per the statement of asaf ali , bhagat singh also submitted arguments on his own behalf .
he made it clear to the court that the legal adviser would neither cross - examine the witness , nor address the court .
he agreed to shri duni chand being appointed as his legal adviser .
bhagat singh did not offer any defence during the trial .
for him the trial meant more a platform for propagating his revolutionary ideas for the country ' s freedom than an occasion for saving his life .
when bhagat singh came to know of it he was furious .
whether i agree with him or not , my heart is full of admiration for the courage and self - sacrifice of a man like bhagat singh .
courage of the bhagat singh type is exceedingly rare .
he began his career as a revolutionary and joined the revolutionary movement in bengal in the year 1906 .
he was involved in the chingripota railway station dacoity case in december , 1907 and also in the netra dacoity in 1910 .
she took out a copper coin from her miserable bag and placed it in his hand .
when she icturned home and opened the bag , she found a gold coin in place of the one she had parted with .
" oh , why did i not give my all ? " she wailed .
in another poem he is a woman waiting at night for her lover .
the range was comprehensive , the analysis sober and lucid , and the style so charming that what he said was itself afine specimen of literature .
during the brief seven months at his disposal , roy acquired many supporters for his views , including leading congressmen , in various parts of the country .
seldom had the indian police worked as hard to capture a man as in the case of roy .
within a few days after his arrival in india , the authorities had suspected his presence .
m . n . roy had been committed by the magistrate to sessions on 15th october , 1931 .
after several postponements , his trial in the court of sessions began on 3rd november , 1931 .
roy ' s trial did not take place , as usual , in open court .
it took place in the jail in which he was locked up .
the government , it seems , did not want any popular demonstration to take place .
roy refused to appear before a court sitting behind prison walls , but , he was forcibly taken to the court .
he applied for trial by jury .
the application was refused and he was tried with the help of assessors .
in other words , the mercenary army with which the sovereignty of the british is maintained in a foreign country is an instrument of moral or virtuous force .
but the same weapon in the hands of the oppressed people of india fighting for freedom will be the instrument of crime .
dwelling on the history of constitutional developments in england , he pointed out :
" the history of england teaches us that resistance and rebellion against the established state are the motive force of political progress . "
he continued , " indians shall give their country a political system better than the rusty british constitution .
premnath sehgal , shah nawaz khan and gurbaksh singh dhil - lon .
the aim then was not so much to prove that they broke the oath of allegiance but that they committed murders , atrocities and war crimes .
this step evoked the sympathy of the entire nation towards the officers .
the indian national congress took an active part in organising the defence of the accused .
a high level committee of top lawyers was formed which included pandit jawahar lal nehru , sir tej bahadur sapru , mr asaf ali and others .
two significant trials were held in the red fort of delhi .
each changed the course of political history as each involved important legal issues of national and international importance .
in 1858 , the famous trial of the last mughal emperor , bahadur shah zafar , was held in the red fort of delhi .
this trial gave a final blow to mughal rule in india and established british supremacy in the country .
important issues of international law were involved in the trial as to whether a king could be tried and whether such a trial was justified in law .
he threw the book on the table and as the night was far advanced blew out the lamp with the intention of retiring to bed .
no sooner had he done so than the moonlight burst into the room through the open windows .
he paid frequent visits to calcutta to see his wife and children .
the family had started a new literary monthly called sadhanain place of the old one , bharati .
the trial statted on 5th november , 1945 and went on till 31st december , 1945 .
this was an accretion of strength to the indians overseas .
provisional government of free india was set up at singapore .
it was recognised by japan , germany , thailand and manchokia .
japan agreed to hand over the andaman and nicobar islands to the provisional government , and thus the indian national army came to be known all over the world .
thirty witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution in support of the charges .
the communique cited :
what is the soul ' s relation to god ?
must we approach truth on our terms or on its own ?
they are very different from each other and from the previous dramas , although the central character in both of them is a young boy .
thus sheikh muhammad abdullah became the living and outstanding symbol of the urge of the kashmir ! people for their freedom .
thus also the trial of sheikh abdullah was something much more than the trial of an individual : it was the trial of a whole people .
in 1942 , the indian national congress gave a call for complete independence and for quit india ' .
naturally my government had to take action and took it , with the result that abdullah and a number of his little friends were arrested .
being what he is , jawahar lal has completely gone off the deep end . "
pandit jawahar lal nehru went to kashmir to extend all possible moral and legal suport to sheikh abdullah for his defence .
the german stage version of the play which the ! poet saw in berlin in 1921 was suggestive of a fairy story .
amal represents the man whose soul has received the call of the open road . . . "
or one who is a thirst for the faraway , to quote a line from one of tagore ' s earlier songs .
the other play , achalayatan ( the immovable ) , has not been published in english and is indeed hard to translate .
" what merit is there in singing ?
nor is it any the less interesting as a novel .
it is worth recalling how this novel came to be written .
those who have read her books know what a passionate advocate she was of everything hindu .
tagore who liked and admired her for her sincerity and courage must of ten have smiled when she preached hinduism to him more hindu than the hindu !
so he began telling her the story of gora and later wrote it down .
gora is an irish foundling whose parents were killed in the so - called sepoy mutiny of 1857 .
a kind brahmin lady brings up the baby as her own .
our air is being poisoned with the by - products of an expanding technological society .
air pollution is nothing new , but what is new is the scope and severity of air pollution .
in recent times , quite a large number of industries can be seen in urban areas as well as in rural pockets .
most of these industries spew dense smoke from their chimneys .
what is this smoke made of and how is it produced ?
industries require steam and to produce it various fuels such as coal , coke , furnace oil are burnt .
where does this smoke go ?
thermal power stations are rated the first among the industries that discharge high amounts of smoke and ash .
he has no place what so ever in the orthodox hindu society by which he had sworn .
this realisation brings him to his senses and he understands the true significance of his nation ' s heritage .
" today i am really an indian .
in me there is no longer any opposition between hindu , mussulman arid christian .
today every caste in india is my caste , . the food of all is my food . "
effects of air pollution air pollution can affect human health , animals , plants , materials , besides causing global effects .
air pollution is mostly associated with respiratory diseases ranging from common cold to lung cancer .
both gaseous and particulate pollutants cause severe damage to the respiratory system leading to emphysema , bronchitis and asthma .
deaths from lung cancer are on the increase and the prime causative agent is suspected to be polluted air .
the disease is gradually progressive and death occurs due to heart failure or pulmonary tuberculosis .
a summary of air pollutants and their effects on human health is given in table 1 for ready reference .
table 1 major air pollutants and their effects on human health wo .
sulphur dioxide industries , especially where coal and oil are fired .
the effects of air pollution on domestic animals are similar to those observed in man .
if the greenhouse gases increase then more heat will be trapped and radiated back to the earth , resulting in the earth becoming warmer still .
undue warming of the earth will lead to grave consequences .
human beings will become more vulnerable to disease due to a substantial increase in viruses , parasites and insects that thrive better under warmer conditions .
what is this ozone layer ?
the maximum concentration is at a distance of 20 - 25 kms .
india too will be affected by the large - scale changes in the ozone layer .
prevention and control of air pollution prevention and control of air pollution is the need of the hour as both the animal and human population is endangered .
the first and foremost rule is to ensure that there is no incomplete combustion .
the combustion can be increased by reducing the size of the fuel and adjusting the ratio of air to fuel .
for example , coal may be pulverised and then used .
coke briquettes may be reduced to a smaller size and then put to use .
to limit global warming to the minimum extent , concerted efforts are needed .
the lifestyle in developed countries - has to be changed especially in the use of petroleum products .
any such ban will not reverse the harm already done .
major air pollution disasters our present knowledge of the effects of air pollution is mainly derived from the study of acute air pollution episodes .
some of the following episodes will help explain the severity of air pollution .
let only thy will be fulfilled in my life ! "
love is the keyword .
fifty years of a rich and fruitful career closed in 1911 .
nor are these memoirs a chronicle of events as in a diary .
even birds are not spared .
birds breeding near acidified lakes have been known to be poisoned by aluminium which they pick up while eating aquatic insects .
nutrients which are necessary for plant growth are leached or made unavailable .
the net result is damage to plants , stunted growth and increased susceptibility to disease .
let us now see the effect of acid rain on inanimate objects .
are stones vulnerable to leprosy ?
twice before a sojourn abroad had proved helpful and stimulating .
now again at the cross - roads , he looked wistfully towards the west .
and so in the beginning of 1912 he made preparations for his third voyage to europe .
his luggage , already on board , had to be sentback from madras where the ship halted next .
however most developed countries have banned the use of ddt and the like products .
an interesting event of 1985 comes to my mind .
about 200 people in the usa and canada had to be hospitalised after consuming their favourite summer fruit , the watermelon .
the chemical is prepared from methyl isocyanate ( mic ) , the leakage of which claimed about 4,000 lives in the bhopal gas tragedy during 1984 .

perhaps you think that by now i have got over that delusion .
that i have written in english seems to be the delusion .
the pages of a small exercise - book came to be filled gradually , and with it in my pocket i boarded the ship . "
suspended matter is present in sewage and most industrial waste waters .
moreover , abrasive materials present in the suspended matter can choke the gills of fish and destroy them .
the coal - washery waste waters , which are black and opaque , discolour the stream and render it unfit for most uses .
suspended matter containing organic material putrefies during warm weather .
as a result , solids buoyed by gas may rise to the surface , leading to the formation of floating masses of foul - smelling sludge .
gaseous pollutants : this category includes ammonia , free chlorine , hydrogen sulphide , ozone and phospine .
inhalation of considerable quantities of ammonia produces a spasm of the glottis and may even lead to death .
electric generating plants , nuclear power plants and other manufacturing units require large amounts of water for ' cooling ' .
the discharge of hot trade effluents from electricity generating stations may cause a temperature rise of several degrees in a river or a canal .
about 80 per cent of total water withdrawn for industrial operations is used for cooling only .
nuclear power plants release 50 per cent of the heat generated to the water bodies ( normally to the oceans ) .
distilleries also discharge hot effluents at temperatures ranging between 60 c and 80 c .
the effects of thermal pollution are mainly on aquatic animals , particularly fish .
obviously many square metres of arable lands have been laid waste .
the extent of sea - water intrusion is such that one cannot add milk to brew tea .
the milk turns sour as soon as it is added to water , because of excess salinity .
while surface water flushes away the pollutants , the latter cannot be flushed away from the ground - water .
as a result , the effects of such pollution may continue for indefinite periods .
pollutants in oceans many of us believe that the ocean is too vast to be polluted by man ' s activities .
while it was true some time ago , it no longer holds true now .
the cumulative effects of pollutants affect oceans too .
it is to be mentioned here that about 85 per cent of pollution of the oceans has its origin on land .
ocean is the ultimate dust - bin where the polluted rivers along with their water , discharge pollutants .
since ages , the ocean had been the work - horse to consume all these pollutants and transform into various materials of its own eco - system .
thor hyerdahl , during his expedition on the ra ii , was aghast at the pollution in the middle of the atlantic .
he saw dark brown lumps of tar - like material , of the size of fine gravel , in parts of the ocean .
the coastal area and ocean surface get severely affected by oil spills and oil slicks .
this has been described in detail in the next chapter .
plastic containers and other forms of rnan - made garbage cause ocean contamination .
about 20,000 hectares of agricultural land have been declared unfit for cultivation .
the problem is further aggravated by the conversion of ground - water to saline water .
the distressing condition of river yamuna cannot be simply explained in words .
polluted water is stated to be responsible for two - thirds of all illnesses in india and at times water - borne diseases acquire epidemic proportions .
this method can be used for treating tannery effluents .
such common effluent treatment plants are coming up in tamil nadu at ambur , vaniyambadi and ranipet where innumerable tanneries are located .
bio - gas production : what we consider waste may soon be converted into wealth .
oil can get spilled during transfer from ship to shore or from ship to ship .
spillage also occurs due to the incorrect operation of valves , etc . on ship - board or at oil terminals .
the floating sheets of oil stretching for many kilometres affect the photosynthetic activity in oceans .
formation of such tar balls poses a serious threat to marine life and seabirds .
the dumping of solid wastes as already stated , spoils the beauty of cities and towns , and causes health problems .
the garbage mountains become breeding grounds for disease - carrying vectors such as flies , mosquitoes , rats and cockroaches .
reports indicate that about 8,00,000 flies can be produced in one cubic metre of garbage .
it is reported that about 25 human diseases are associated with the solid wastes .
the accumulation of solid waste is a mounting problem with no easy solution in sight .
unlike other types of pollution , preventive measures cannot be adopted in this case .
several solutions to the disposal problem have been proposed .
it is reported that as soon as the bomb fell , people rushed out , screaming and scrambling for water .
their skin started peeling off , and killed nearly 70,000 people instantaneously .
by the end of the year the toll rose to about 1,40,000 .
nuclear explosion tests not only release radioactive materials affecting the test sites but also the remote corners , endangering flora and fauna of the - place .
man has been continually exposed to natural sources of radiation , like cosmic radiations from outer space and sun ' s radiations .
certain types of rocks and soils and radioactive gases also contribute to radiation .
nuclear power plants no doubt help in the production of electricity .
at present about 17 per cent of the world ' s electricity is generated through nuclear sources .
radiation therapy should be used only when absolutely necessary , and that too within the required limits .
extreme care should be exercised in the disposal of radioactive wastes .
to elaborate further , in nuclear power plants three types of wastes are generated , viz . low level , medium level and high level .
hitherto the low - level waste was generally diluted and let out into the sea .
now it is buried at particular disposal sites .
the high - level wastes are liquid wastes which emit excessive radiations and cannot be released into the environment .
through evaporation they are concentrated and stored in double - walled stainless steel tanks with concrete casing and kept underground within concrete walls .
here these wastes are converted into solid blocks of glass - like substances , by a process called vitrification .
despite rigorous monitoring and surveillance of radiation , the safety of nuclear reactors is doubtful .
by a . d . 2000 it is possible that no one above age ten will hear normally . "
- s . kameswaran hitherto we have been discussing varied types of pollution caused by materials .
a strange type of pollution that came to light in the last two decades ' is noise pollution .
the net result is the drying up of streams , lakes and tanks .
all these disasters lead to enormous losses , poverty and suffering .
besides aggravating poverty , irreversible large - scale climatic changes occur . drought , hunger , floods and misery become inevitable .
in the nilgiri district of tamil nadu about 680 sq km have been reported to be affected by soil erosion .
the eastern ghats too have become victims of denudation of forests .
the mountain chain once covered by luxuriant forests has now become barren land .
waste water after suitable treatment can be used for agriculture and aquaculture .
most paper mills in india utilise their effluents for raising paddy , sugarcane , etc .
recycling of industrial wastes and solid wastes to useful materials is slowly acquiring importance .
as our natural resources are dwindling fast , alternate energy sources have to be made use of .
for example , electricity can be generated from wind energy which incurs negligible operation costs and is environment friendly .
it is time for them to alter their lifestyle to render the world free from pollution .
she could wield the bow with her hands but not with her eyes .
one day while she was chasing a deer in the forest dressed in man ' s hunting costume , she came upon a man lying across her path .
she asked him haughtily to move aside but he took no heed .
enraged , she pricked him with the sharp end of her bow .
" then for the first time in my life i felt myself a woman , and knew that a man was before me . "
she asked him who he was .
" i am arjuna of the great kuru clan , " he replied .
the princess was stunned .
here before her was the fabulous warrior whom every damsel of the age worshipped in her dreams .
" i was going along my lonely path when the light in my hand went out .
this sudden storm which is driving me into the dark is now my only companion .
at first he was happy and felt as though he had till then been " living on half - rations " .
there were no menacing clouds in the political horizon and the great war when it came , came suddenly in august .
how and why he should have sensed its advent , is difficult to explain .
" god knows it is the death pang that is tearing open my heart , " he wrote to andrews .
soon after writing phalguni , tagore had his first meeting with gandhi in march 1915 .
but they got on splendidly and tagore grew to love gandhi ' s boys as his own .
this was his second visit to the asrama ; he had come a month earlier when tagore was not there .
tagore , the pagan - lover , saw heaven where gandhi failed to see it .
to be with him , to be at unison with him in some creative work , is a privilege which it is very difficult to state in words .
indeed , it has been by far the greatest privilege of my life .
side by side with the friendship with the poet , i have had the supreme happiness of a second personal friendship with mahatma gandhi .
his marvellous spiritual genius has appealed to me in a very different way .
in these cases stone cannot be said to have gone into actual construction which was still of brick .
this was easily assimilable in this area which had an earlier megalithic tradition .
it is a carved slab of palnad limestone of about the fourth century ad and perhaps formed the top piece of a brick platform .
it was probably originally installed in a shrine for worship .
evidently these names indicate different plans and styles of construction .
had their temples survived , they too would not have differed much in form from the hindu or jain temples of those days .
the front view of the apsidal structures can be noted in many of these relief sculptures .
the entire structure was often built over a solid masonry platform or adhishthana .
the apsidal guntupalle chaitya ( second century ad ) is wholly brick - built .
the inscription on a conch ( sankha ) found at the same site also bears the same name .
it is perhaps of the vishnukundini times and was meant originally for a buddhist dedication .
in all these excavations the roughness of the texture , even of finished surface , necessitated a plaster coating to render it smooth .
further embellishments came by way of rich paintings of which we have many extant as the celebrated paintings of ajanta .
these , incidentally , are far more numerous than similar excavations in the north .
this was perhaps because they were innovations that avoided the use of traditional materials of architecture and sculpture and as such militated against the sampradaya .
evidently , it took them time to become acceptable .
the pallava cave - temples form a more coherent series and as such can be considered first .
the cave - temples excavated by mahendra are authenticated by his own inscriptions which are very often single dedicatory verses or strings of his titles .
such temples are ten in number .
this cave - temple is also the only example excavated near the summit of the hill , while the rest are nearer to the base of the rocks .
the facade is longer with four , six or eight equally - spaced pillars between the extreme pilasters and with three , five , or seven shrine - cells .
the pillars are all massive , short , square in section at the base and top , with the middle third of the height octagonal in section .
the rudravalisvaram of mamandur and the kalmandakam cave - temple at kuranganilmuttam are examples with three shrine - cells , as at mandagappattu .
pallavaram is the only example in the series where the mandapa facade and shrine - cells face south .
this too is rock - cut and stands on the floor of the ardha - mandapa on a distinct plinth at a still higher level .
the cell on the east faces west into the front part of the mandapa between the inner and outer rows of columns .
incidentally , the lalitankura pallavesvaram cave - temple of tiruchirapalli is the southernmost pallava cave - temple nearer to the borders of the pandya territory .
the siyamangalam cave - temple has small relief panels of sculpture on top of the pilasters .
the siyamangalam cave - temple is unique even otherwise , in having small sculpture panels on top of the facade pillars and pilasters in place of the lotus medallion .
the singavaram and singaperumalkovil cave - temples are dedicated to vishnu , the kotikal mandapam to durga and the rest to siva .
two more such somaskanda reliefs are found carved on the hind wall of the mandapa on either side of the shrine entrance .
this indicated the commencement in the pallava territory with the installation of the formless linga to represent siva .
the space between them is equal but wider .
the kapota over the facade is still an undifferentiated , projecting rock - ledge over the beam .
this cave - temple is the only example in the series which has an outer pair of dvarapalas at either end of the mandapa facade .
the inner pair flanking the shrine entrance is in common with the rest .
in the singavaram cave - temple , as at siyamangalam , there are small panel reliefs of two female devotees on top of the pilasters of the inner row .
the last series of pallava temples dated after ad 730 are small and less interesting .
they mark the decadent phase of this type of rock architecture in tondaimandalam .
the cell contains on its hind wall a flat bas - relief of standing vishnu .
the prastara is fully finished with a flexed kapota , or an eaves - like cornice projection , decorated by horseshoe - shaped kudu arches .
this contains bas - relief jain tirthankara sculptures on the hind wall of the shrine and in the niches on the lateral walls of the mandapa in front .
the cave - temple at trikkur , near trichur in kerala , is a large excavation of a square chamber with a lingo , at the centre .
this has also a third shrine cut into the rear walls of the mandapa , in addition to the two thus excavated into either end walls of the mandapam .
for example , in the malai - yakkovil at kudumiyamalai capital components like the kalasa , kumbha , etc . are cut on tops of the facade columns .
' they are ganesa , the saptamatrika and jyeshtha .
the saptamatrika group is met with in the cave - temples at tirugokarnam , malai - yadippatti , tirukkalakkudi and kunnattur .
the western gangas alone despite their chalukyan affinities as stated before made a deviation in that they excavated into the hard local granite as at melkote ( mysore ) .
these are reached by a natural incline in front with steps .
the earliest and largest one is cave iii excavated by mangalesa in ad 578 and dedicated to vishnu .
it is cut at the most commanding height visible from the valley in front .
both are excavated into the low sandstone outcrops , and mark the latest of the early chalukyan or western chalukyan series in their home districts .
in front of the shrine there is an inner pradakshina - mandapa between two rows of four pillars each , forming part of the circumambulatory passage round the shrine .
on the southern side of this court , a smaller cave - temple for durga is excavated into the scarp .
into this a smaller siva cave - temple is cut , consisting of a square shrine with a mandapa in front .
at the eastern and longer end a large gateway or mahadvara is carved with a central passage and flanking mandapas on either side , one of them enshrining ganesa .
the mahadvara leads into an open court and the eastern facade , which is an agra - mandapa with a higher floor - level .
outside this is a narrow open court .
the rock wall beyond has incomplete or abandoned excavations of a smaller size , of which the one at the extreme end is dedicated to siva .
the original dedication of the main sanctum was to siva , though the temple now enshrines a modern idol of a goddess .
the three shrine - cells were perhaps dedicated to the hindu trinity , the central one to siva and the lateral ones to brahma and vishnu .
all these features would point to the second half of the eighth century as its date in the rashtrakuta times .
the group of two adjacent cave - temples at arvelam in goa is a rare instance of excavation into the local laterite of the west coast overlooking a stream .
one of them , the southern cave - temple , is a triple - celled unit containing in each unit a linga mounted on a rock - cut pitha .
the linga forms in their symbolic aspect differ from one another and represent three different deities .
the linga shaft in the northern cell is surmounted by a flat spear - head , or sakti , indicating that it represents kumara or kartikeya .
the most outstanding feature of the rock - cut cave art has been , from the buddhist times , the dominance of sculpture over architecture .
the different god - forms sculptured are depicted often in the narrative or synoptic panels .
they vary in size from very large - sized individual figures , as the dvarapalas , mahesamurti , etc . to almost the size of cameos .
the siva forms are tandava murti , harihara , and ardhanari .
among the others are ganesa , kartikeya , durga and mahishamardini .
at aihole ( ravalapudi or ravalagudi ) , we have varaha , harihara , ardhanari , gangadhara , saptamatrikas , mahishamardini and the two nidhis .
the ganesalena at ellora depicts also the shanmata or six - fold cult of surya , vishnu , siva , kartikeya , ganesa and durga .
the mandapa facade has on top a fully formed kapota with kudus as in the mamalla - style cave - temples of the pallavas .
the pillars are square in section and of the chalukyan pattern as found in the cave - temples on the banks of the krishna .
the shrine entrances are plain and without any over - door .
the idea was further elaborated by the buddhists in the large hypaethral stupa forms at sankaram ( visakhapatnam district , andhra pradesh ) .
a case in point is the great brihadisvara vimana of thanjavur , which rises to a height of over 60 metres .
they are nandis or bhutas in siva temples , lions in devi , vishnu or jain temples , garuda in vishnu temples , and so on .
this became an invariable feature of the southern temples from this period onwards .
according to the planfour - sided , polygonal or curvilinearthe southern vimanas are classified in the southern silpa and agama texts as nagara , dravida and vesara .
that which is hexagonal or octagonal from the base to the finial , or has a hexagonal or octagonal griva and sikhara , is termed dravida .
a third variant would be the one with the addition of a flexed kapota or cornice below the pattika region .
a jagati or kumuda may also be placed over a series of lotus petals shown as spread over the upana .
the mandapas of the southern temples are all flat - roofed , however long or large they may be .
this is in sharp contrast to what obtains in the northern prasada temples whether of gujarat , orissa or central india .
this with a uniform polygonal plan from base to apex would conform to the pure dravida class of southern vimanas as described in the texts .
the entrances of the three vimana fronts are guarded by appropriate dvarapala figures carved inside the niches .
it is inside a niche placed over the moulded adhishthana having a flight of steps in front , as in the adjoining trimurti shrine .
the five rathas at the southern end of mahabalipuram comprise a group by themselves .
the central mass that intervened between the two rathas was retained and cut out as a large sculpture of a recumbent nandi facing west .
they are replicas of ekatala nagara vimanas , square in section from base to apex .
the much damaged remains of a monolithic vimana are to be found in vijayawada , in front of the upper cave - temple of the akkanria - madanna group .
these would also recall similar models found in the temple precincts at satyavolu , mahanandi and alampur in the adjoining kurnool district .
this creation of rashtrakuta krishna i ( 756 - 775 ) is rather unique .
the upper storey is connected with the floor of the nandi - mandapa .
behind this on the hill are the remains of an unfinished sala - type edifice , monolithic likewise and akin to the bhima and ganesa rathas of the pallavas .
there is another chaumukh standing in the forecourt of cave 33 .
the stele is placed at the centre of the sanctum floor and is visible through the doors from all four sides .
the chota kailasa stands farther away and higher up .
it can be dated about ad 800 , if not slightly earlier .
the four nandis on the corners of the top tula round the base of the griva indicate the date and the dedication of the temple to siva .
furthermore , ' rock architecture ' implied the creation of temples only in places where there were hills or rocks .
the hara is found again on the upper storeys except the topmost .
the griva and sikhara which are modern restorations in brick and mortar are , as per the original plan , octagonal .
the corners of the walls of the aditala and of the attached shrines are cantoned by bold rearing vyala pilasters characteristic of rajasimha temples .
otherwise the walls lack sculpture as in the mukundanayanar temple , evidently because of the hard material of construction .
the northern outer shrine contains remnants of a pallava mural painting depicting a dancing siva with parvati .
the superstructural talas are built over a bridge of slabs spanning the tops of the two massive walls of the aditala .
the third storey has again a hara of kutas and salas above , and the fourth carries only four nandis on the four corners at its top .
the pilasters cantoning the aditala wall and those of the abutting shrines have rearing vyala bases , peculiar to the rajasimha temples .
the whole is surrounded by a prakara with a gap on the middle of its east side and enclosing an open court all around .
inside there are two lateral oblong shrines in the centre on the north and south .
this alone would denote that the plastering was at best an afterthought in the times of the founder himself or immediately thereafter .
for , an inscription would not be incised on a surface if it was to be covered over by plaster .
prince kampana is known from inscriptions to have repaired the damages wrought by the muslim incursions and restored worship in the temple .
this accounts for fragmentary paintings of the vijayanagar period too .
two of these are complete and the third is represented by its extant basement only .
the whole was surrounded by sixteen sub - shrines and a prakara , with the small entrance gopumm on the west .
this temple is another important landmark in the line of the great south indian temples .
they are of varying widths corresponding to their corner karnakutas , central salas , and inter - vening panjaras of the ham over the prastara of that side .
the devakoshtha niches accommodated between pilasters cantoning the relieved bays have varied sculptures set inside for kuta , panjara or torana frames .
the second tala carries four karnakutas and three salas over its prastam on three sides .
the prakara wall has over its coping a series of kutas and salas , as over the ramkara of the larger vimana of the pallava shore temple .
the mallikarjuna built close to the virupaksha is a smaller temple with a four - storeyed vimana square in all its talas .
the griva and sikhara above are circular .
it has also a prominent sukanasika projected forward from its upper talas .
the upa - pitha terminates in front as a still narrower landing platform with lateral flights of steps and a frontal banis - ter .
they are all interconnected by kakshasanas or seats with lean - back rests , as is common in chalukyan structures .
the inner wall of a typical short apse or chapa form encloses the cella .
the pillar capitals too have lost their original shape and robustness and are transformed into mere conventional shapes found in the later chalukyan temples .
the prastara carries a ham of kutas , salas and panjaras .
the second tala has a sanctum enclosed by the upward extension of the inner wall of the aditala .
the third storey of some lesser width is relieved on its sides except on the front or sukanasika side .
the bays contain udgama motifs as in northern - style temples .
the square sikhara following the same scheme of offsetting simulates a twelve - ribbed member heralding similar modifications in the later chalukyan temples .
these along with the two superimposed larger or main doorways on the east make the vimana a chaumukh or chaturmukha structure , described as sarvatobhadra in the texts .
in front of this antarala is laid the north - south transept with flights of steps at either end , north and south , described above .
the outer doorway is flanked by two colossal dvarapalas as are the outer entrances too .
the intermediate bays of least width have the panjaras at their top , thus constituting the full hara of aedicules over the second tala prastara .
the main pilasters containing the corners of the bays and their angles with the walls are square in section with full capitals .
the chola layer has been exposed wherever extant by peeling off the damaged nayaka layer to reveal its richness .
other paintings of dancers , musicians , birds , animals , etc . are interesting .
each tala carries over its prastara a ham of kutas , salas and panjaras .
the topmost tala has instead four nandis placed at the four corners with the octagonal griva and sikhara rising up from the midst .
the topmost stones closing the ultimate gap alone is estimated from their size to weigh 80 tons ( 81.3 metric tonnes ) .
the water goes along the chutes running through the bases of the two walls and along the floor of the sandhara circumambulatory in between .
the lengthy pranala , or spout , is supported on the head of a bhuta squatting over the upa - pitha platform , blowing a conch .
opposite to this pranala and a little to the east is built the coeval square vimana for chandikesvara , the seneschal of the siva temple .
this position located by rajaraja in his great temple became the norm for all siva temples of subsequent periods .
on the middle of the eastern side the prakara has a massive gopura built entirely of stone .
these are framed by simple over - doors with sakhas and crowned by horizontal lintels .
such temples are rather rare in the chola and pandimandalams further south .
the topmost tala carries four square karnakutas , again flanked by a pair of recumbent nandis , one on either side .
it persisted for about a century in some temples and disappeared , as before , leaving the place for nandis alone .
the main axial complex of vimana and mandapas is similar to the plan in the brihadisvara .
these kumbha panjaras became a common feature .
they are also to be found in tiruvarur , kudumiyamalai , vridhdhachalam , chidambaram and many other places .
the top talas are devoid of the hara , the top sikhara has a prominently splayed out brim or lip , and the sides are offset repeatedly .
the door lintels too are elaborate makara toranas , often with a gajalakshmi crest as the lalata bimba .
another oblong shrine with narrow front mandapa stands next to the navalinga cluster .
the other ruined structures are all enclosed by a prakara with two openings on two of the four sides .
the mention of goddesses like ganga , kalika , sarasvati and mahamayi in the associated inscriptions indicates a strong devi cult in this centre .
the kudus on the cornices are beginning to lose their horseshoe shape and have become flat facets or ante - fixes .
there are two rectangular shrines facing the four central pillars of the mandapa , perhaps originally dedicated to ganapati and durga .
it has a square five - storeyed nirandhara vimana , with a square griva and sikhara .
the pillars inside the mandapa have square bases .
the chennakesvara temple unit at belur was built by hoysala vishnuvardhana in 1117 and consecrated to vishnu with the name vijaya narayana .
the walls of the garbha - griha are sometimes plain in the simpler cases as in the one on the tank - bund at palampet .
when alternately projected and recessed , the bays are broad , flat pilaster patterns , often with shrine - motifs at their bases .
the recesses contain a slender pilaster carrying a shrine top at its apex over its abacus with a superposed creeper or patra - lata torana over it .
it is rather a slopy , straight , projected ledge , often large .
the sukanasika , projected in , front of the vimana superstructure is an invariable characteristic , marking the chalukyan derivation of the temples .
the lintel has a gajalakshmi relief and the introduction of a wide - set projecting door cornice over each one of the doorways is reminiscent of the kakatiya mode .
their pose is also true to nature , attesting to the acquaintance of the sculptor with things of nature .
to the ascetic yogi , it will be a form of sadhana or penance ( tapas ) .
the superstructure of the vimana or garbha part is an upward continuation of the inner wall or antara bhitti .
there are three niches provided in the main bhadras of the three cardinals , south , west , and north while on the east comes the prominent sukanasa .
the prastara of this second tala harmya or the uparichchadya is composed of seven tiers of curved cornices or kapotas .
the fourth tala of still lesser height , again of the same pattern , carries an uparichchadya of the three kapotas .
the top of the third tola carrying the grihapindi or base of the griva has four nandis at the four corners or vidiks .
built of granite , it stands on a lofty and well - moulded upa - pitha platform .
its five - storeyed square vimana is a double - walled sandhara structure , and the tala superstructure has the characteristic sukanasika projection .
a horizontal band divides the exterior wall face into upper and lower halves .
the lower half shows a series of shrine fronts between paired pilasters .
the twin temples of ramesvara and virabhadra in nearby keladi , the earlier seat of the dynasty , are built of greyish - green granite .
the two separate vimanas have their front mandapas inter - connected .
they took note of what was developing further north .
the kapota tiers are decorated by relieved kuda , motifs , particularly at the centre on each side .
the separating necks , or galas , may be altogether absent or much abbreviated so as not to be visible .
these also came to be built in other parts of karnataka and andhra .
the smaller amalakas found squeezed in at the corners of the superstructure of the prasada , hence called karnamalakas , are the only basis for differentiating the bhumis .
these are generally tri rathas with front mandapas .
the outer wall is plain or decorated and often provided with a pillared porch .
the former ones are of sandhara type , while the latter one is of the nirandham type , though they are similar in general outward form to the first .
the sangamesvara in the mahakutesvara group is of the tri ratha lay - out with a pillared mandapa in front .
the larger ramalingesvara has a sanctum , antarala and axial mandapas in front .
the shrine wall is plain but for a devakoshtha niche on each side .
among the diminutive shrines are to be found specimens with square , rectangular and apsidal plans .
the panchalingesvara , also near kurnool , though much renovated , also belongs to this class .
it has a pillared mandapa in front with a central raised clerestory roof and lateral wings with slopy roofs .
it contains an inscription of vijayaditya ' s time , about ad 750 .
the somesvara at chebrolu , and the panchalingesvara at panchalingula also belong to this category .
this type of rekha - prasadas soon fell out of vogue in these areas ; it could not extend any further south into the tamil territory .
because of their rough and pitted surface , the walls are heavily plastered and the few decorations are picked out in stucco .
the roof timbers rest directly on the wall plate on top of the walls , and converge in gable form to meet at the top .
the local name kihvasal ( parrot entrance ) is suggestive of the name sukanastka .
externally , it is often ribbed and divided into ringed nodes at intervals and supported below by a bhuta or gana .
the srikoyil has a detached small front mandapa , often square with a slopy roof , called the namaskam - mandapa .
most of the kerala temples now existing are not very old , the oldest dating from medieval or post - medieval times .
the eldest ones , because of the perishable fabric of construction , have been lost , but for their stone adhishthanas and sculptures of gods , dvarapalas , etc .
these give us an idea of the continuity from at least the tenth century ad if not earlier .
the adhishthana is invariably of granitic stone , while the walls and superstructure may be of granite , laterite or brick and timber .
the roof is made of planks , metal sheet or tiles , or even thatch in extremely humble cases .
it may be a single flight of steps or sopana marga , laid in front of the door providing direct ascent .
or , often , there is a landing laid in front of the doorway with lateral flights of steps , one on either side .
from its inscriptions the temple is known to have been in existence from the twelfth century , though its foundations could have been much older .
it is perhaps the smallest apsidal structure in the kerala mode of construction .
in the north - west corner of the outer court is the large kuttambalam or opera - hall , rectangular in shape , and built in typical kerala style .
the stone - built central shrine is appropriately oblong on plan to enshrine the reclining form of anantasayin vishnu .
it is two - storeyed with pent and gable roof patterns for its storeys .
the walls are painted and there are subsidiary shrines for deities like krishna , kshetrapala , narasimha , sasta , garuda , etc .
its stone sculptures are of a fine quality as also the wood - carving on the ceiling of the namaskara - mandapa .
all round there is a nalambalam of lesser height .
the tirunavay vishnu temple also belongs to the same category .
the roofs are made of metal sheeting and the four - sided pyramidal sikharas have four kilivasal nasikas and single metal gold - gilt stupis on top .
the namaskara - mandapa has profuse wood - carvings , while the wall of the shrine has interesting mural paintings .
the srikoyil at vaikom is similar , circular and ekatala , with an immense conical copper - sheet roofing , and a single stupi .
the siva temple at ettumanur , noted for its paintings , especially of nataraja , has a simple ekatala srikoyil , which is also circular on plan .
the pent roof covering the storey below and the apsidal ridged roof above , with a gable front , has a row of three stupis on top .
when , after a prolonged fight , the british regained control of delhi , bahadur shah went into hiding .
the prosecutor for the government was major f . j . harriot , deputy judge advocate general .
at last when the clock struck half - past twelve , he was called in .
after much exertion and pressure he was made to say ' no ' only .
the trial lasted twenty - one working days commencing from 27th january , 1858 to tuesday , the 9th march , 1858 .
the judge advocate read the translation of the prisoner ' s defence before the commission which was written by him in urdu .
this ignominious trial also brought to an end the rule of mughal dynasty in india and that of the east india company .
surendra nath baneijea surendra nath banerjea was born on 10th november , 1848 in a reputed brahmin family of calcutta .
surendra nath did his schooling at the parental academic institution which ws attended chiefly by anglo - indian boys .
he passed the competitive examination in 1869 .
there was some controversy aver his exact age , because of which he was disqualified ; however , the court settled the issue in his favour .
he returned to india in 1871 and was posted to sylhet as assistant magistrate .
surendra nath proceeded to england and appealed to the india office .
he had the satisfaction of unsettling the partition of bengal which lord morley had declared to be a ' settled fact ' .
he reached the climax of his political career in 1906 .
he was also a member of the indian legislative council for many years .
progressive - minded , he advocated widow remarriage and raising the marriageable age of girls .
in his time surendra nath banerjea ' s name was a household word in india .
he had a brilliant academic career and with ease he passed the difficult and much - coveted indian civil service examination .
but he was dismissed from service and he joined the nation ' s freedom struggle .
in the year 1883 , this was too much to swallow and the english judges could not restrain themselves .
they were also asked to file their affidavits and replies immediately .
ramcoomar dey , in his affidavit , disowned all responsibility and threw the entire blame on surendra nath .
in his affidavit , which was prepared in great haste as he was given only a night ' s notice , he submitted :
surendra nath banerjea remained in civil jail for two months but the case created a storm and his name became a household word in the country .
public reaction was swift and intense .
shops were closed and business was suspended in calcutta on the day of imprisonment .
the practice of holding open - air meetings starred , because no hall could contain the crowds that gathered at protest meetings .
hindus were especially enraged because a hindu idol had been brought into court .
justice norris had played a prominent part unbecoming his position in the albert bill controversy and this added to the excitement .
public meetings of sympathy for me and of protest against the judgment of the high court , were held in almost every considerable town .
so strong was the feeling that in some cases even government servants took part in them and suffered for it .
he demanded that india should be granted an autonomous government , absolutely free of the british control , i . e . ' swarajya ' .
due to his differences with the moderates of the indian national congress , tilak started , in 1916 , a home rule league .
his two works , " geeta rahasya ' and the orion ' ( researches into the antiquity of the vedas ) are monuments to his erudition and scholarship .
the historical importance and political implications of lokmanya bal gangadhar tilak ' s trials in 1905 and 1908 can never be overestimated .
he was sentenced for the crime of patriotism .
he was sentenced because he loved his country more than his life or his liberty .
ladies and gentlemen , the verdict that our contemporaries pass on us , the verdict that our times pass on us , is not of much value .
he applied to the high court for leave to appeal to the privy council but leave was refused .
the outcome was known before the trial could start .
the tai maharaj case earlier ( a personal case in poona ) had drained all his financial resources .
fear was haunting him . "
the trial started on 13th july , 1908 in the central hall of the bombay high court building .
strict measures were undertaken before anyone was allowed to enter the trial hall .
on the side of tilak , khaparde , karandikar , baptista , kelkar , bodas and other eminent lawyers occupied the seats to watch the proceedings and assist tilak .
the other side was occupied by mr branson , advocate general , mr inverarity , with mr buining , bar - at - law and government prosecutors respectively .
the gist of the article ' these remedies are not enough ' , published on 9th june , was given to the court and jury .
he concluded that there were three charges which would claim attention of the court and the jury .
the witnesses for the prosecutionbhaskar vishnu joshi , jagannath datar and inspector sullivan - were examined by mr brimming , bar - at - law .
oppression , tyranny and despotism are confounded there and have a distinctly different meaning in writings on political science .
i admit that the idioms of one language cannot be the same as those of another .
it may be said that the defence has not produced its own translation .
tilak ' s argument to counter the charge under section 153 - a was novel and ingenious .
the verdict may likely be a memorable one in the history of the freedom of the indian press .
it is not so here , but it would be a moral support upon which i would rely with great satisfaction . "
he ended his speech to the jury with the words : " i have not come here to ask you any grace .
i am prepared to stand by consequences of my act .
you might not agree with my views .
there are two charges under section 124 - a and one charge under section 153 - a .
the case is a very important one to the accused .
the charges are very serious .
a gloom hung over the entire court - room .
tilak broke the silence and joked , " let us enjoy pur last tea together . "
seven out of the nine members held tilak ' guilty ' on all three counts , while the remaining two held him innocent on all three counts .
his lordship asked tilak , " do you wish to say anything more before i pass sentence ? "
as i said , it can only be a diseased and perverted mind that can think that bombs are legitimate instruments in political agitations .
and it would be a diseased mind that could ever have thought that the articles you wrote were articles that could have been legitimately written .
you wrote about bombs as if they were legitimate instruments in political agitations .
such journalism is a curse to the country .
i feel sorry in sentencing you .
and i think for a man in your position and circumstances that the sentence will vindicate the law and meet the ends of justice .
you are liable to be transported for life under the first two charges .
the advocate general then made an application and withdrew the fourth charge against the accused under section 333 .
for ten days at least the country ' s attention had been focused on tilak ' s trial .
the country would look upon it as if the prosecution sat in judgment over their own case .
tilak required no certificate from him .
tilak ' s conviction shocked freedom fighters everywhere , including lenin , who called it , " the despicable sentence passed on the indian democrat , tilak . "
foreign newspapers reported that the workers in europe now had asian comrades whose numbers will grow by leaps and bounds .
sri aurobindo sri aurobindo ( aurobindo ghose ) was born in calcutta on 15th august , 1872 .
his father , krishnadhone ghose ( 1845 - 1893 ) , came of the well - known ghose family of konnagar , west bengal .
aurobindo , when only seven - years - old , and his two elder brothersbinoybhusan and monmolian - were taken by him to england .
he had his early education in an english family .
he also learnt french and german , italian and spanish to read goethe , dante and calderon in the original languages .
he started writing poetry in greek , latin ani english when he was only eleven .
as a secretary to the indian majlis , cambridge university , he made revolutionary speeches hinting at armed rebellion as the way to india ' s liberation .
at baroda , aurobindo spent thirteen years rising to the post of acting principal of the state college .
he went to calcutta as principal of the newly set - up national college , now jadhavpur university .
aurobindo directed the revolutionary workers to utilise the partition for expanding their activities .
arrested along with 38 other revolutionaries in may , 1908 , aurobindo spent a year in jail as an undertrial prisoner before adquittal .
one evening in february , 1910 , he received information that his office would be searched the next day and he would be arrested .
in 1926 , aurobindo retired into seclusion which was main - tained till his death in 1950 .
it concerned people who were gentlemen belonging to the elite of the society - cultured , educated and highly intelligent .
chaki took out his revolver and shot himself dead .
a wave of shock and consternation shook india .
extracts from his statement are given below :
we managed it for nearly one - and - a - half years , then gave it over to the present managers .
after i gave it up , i took again to recruiting .
i collected altogether fourteen or fifteen young men from about the beginning of 1907 till now .
i educated the boys in religious books and politics .
we were always thinking of far - off revolution and wished to be ready for it , so we were collecting weapons in small quantities .
altogether i have collected eleven revolvers , four rifles and one gun .
he said that he wanted to come among us and be useful as he had learnt the preparation of explosives .
he had a small laboratory in his house without his father ' s knowledge and he experimented there .
i never saw it ; he told me of it .
with his help we began preparing explosives in small quantities in the garden house at 32 , muraripukur road .
our party was divided on the propriety of disclosing these facts .
on 23rd june , 1905 , narendra gossain was pardoned and was discharged .
the magistrate then charged the accused in two batches .
l . birley , district magistrate of 24 parganas , charged the accused who were tried with aurobindo .
" and i hereby direct that you be tried by the said court on the said charges . "
the trial started on 19th october , 1908 before the additional sessions judge who charged the accused as follows :
i hereby charge you as follows :
das was inspired , as it were , in his particular role for an opportunity to defend a seer .
the evidence against aurobindo mostly consisted of his letters to his wife , and speeches and articles .
while commenting on the famous ' sweets letter ' on which the case of spreading the bomb cult throughout india was based , the counsel stated :
" the first great ideal which he sets out in this letter is that he must regard himself as a trustee of all money that belongs to him .
it is his duty tq spend as little as possible for himself for the purpose that he may continue to live and to give the rest to god .
how ?
by doing god ' s work , namely by feeding those who are hungry and by assisting those who are in need .
it is then and then only that you can give back what you owe to god .
it is not for his own selfish ends he is determined to lead that life .
he will keep for himself only what , is absolutely necessary for bare subsistence and the rest he will give back to god .
the only way you can do that is by way of charity , by feeding the hungry and by rendering assistance to those who are in need of it .
there is also in this letter a covert reference to guru ( spiritual guide ) .
unless you get the permission of the guru , you cannot give it out even to your wife .
" then he comes to his third ideal .
here he lays down the basis of his patriotism .
they are unreal as long as you do not realise the association , the connection between them and the absolute .
the tribunal was composed of the chief justices of bombaysir basil scott , sir n . g . chandravarkar and mr justice heaton .
the counsel for the prosecution comprised mr jardine , the advocate general , bombay , mr weldon , sir welinkar and mr ni - colson , the public prosecutor .
the defence consisted of legal luminaries : mr joseph baptista , sri chitre , sri govin - drao gadgil and sri rangnekar .
this special tribunal was constituted to try three cases against him .
they were tried under eight different charges .
the chief prosecution counsel , mr jardine , made the opening speech for the prosecution , which occupied the whole of the first day ' s proceedings .
the court declared that savarkar ' s illegal arrest at marseilles did not in any manner affect the powers of the indian law courts to try him .
about three hundred witnesses were examined and cross - examined and a large number of documents were exhibited .
after the evidence of witnesses was recorded , the chief justice asked savarkar to have his say .
the undaunted savarkar said :
" i am quite innocent of the charges laid against me .
i took part in the proceedings of the trial in england where courts are established by democratic rules sanctioned by the people .
in such courts , one can expect to get justice .
the conditions of indian courts of law is quite the reverse .
the advocate general made a long speech which lasted for a week .
though savarkar ' s name was last in the list of the accused , he began with savarkar .
the defence counsel also took a little more than a week to complete their arguments on behalf of the several accused .
the chief justice began to deliver sentences starting with savarkar .
" vinayak damodar savarkar , the sentence of the court upon you is transportation for life and forfeiture of all your property . "
the sentences on the other accused followed . the decision was ex parte and arbitrary , solely on the untested evidence of prosecution .
the legality of his arrest on the french soil did not bother the tribunal .
this second trial opened on 23rd january , 1911 .
after the advocate general ' s summing up , savarkar was brough from the dock of the bar to have his say .
savarkar reiterated his innocence and said that he had no direct or indirect connection with the crime .
notwithstanding vague , contradictory and inconsistent evidence of the approvers , on 30th january , 1911 , the tribunal sentenced savarkar to another transportation for life .
savarkar then rose and made this memorable statement :
the terms were :
the french government demanded the return of savarkar .
" my public life began in 1893 in south africa in troubled weather .
my first contact with british authority in that country was not of a happy character .
in my humble opinion , non - co - operation with evil is as much a duty as is co - operation with good .
but in the past non - co - operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the evil - doer .
gandhiji took fifteen minutes to read his statement .
as he proceeded with his statement , one could perceive the atmosphere of the hall changing every minute .
no one could have performed this duty better !
to combine the dignity of his position with the courtesy due to the mighty prisoner before him was no easy task .
he seemed to be at a loss for words when he came to the end and pronounced the sentence of simple imprisonment for six . years .
it would be impossible to ignore the fact that in the eyes of millions of your countrymen , you are a great patriot and a great leader .
even those who differ from you in politics look upon you as a man of high ideals and of noble and even saintly life .
the judge then turned to mr banker : " 1 assume you have been to a large extent under the influence of your chief .
to which gandhi replied : " i would say one word .
a minute passed after the pronouncement of the sentence .
he got up , bowed and departed .
" the most epic event of the modern times ended quickly .
it commenced on 15th march , 1929 and lasted nearly four - and - a - half years .
the case was conducted on a gigantic scale .
the evidence consisted of 25 printed volumes of folio size .
the judgment itself was printed in two volumes covering 676 pages of folio size .
the period 1928 - 1929 was significant in indian history for it was the beginning of an organised left - wing movement , with both economic and political components .
the organisation of trade unions enabled the workers to express their grievances and strive for better working conditions and higher wages .
though the communist party of india had been active for some time in india , the movement could not gain any real significance till 1927 .
in this movement a few british nationals too were lending their active support .
the government of india was in continuous correspondence with the british government in england and was taking instructions to adopt legislative and punitive measures .
it was a period of unrest in the country with large sections of the people clamouring for release from political oppression and economic exploitation by the british .
as no one was taken from the indian side on this commission , a call for its boycott was given by gandhiji .
this procession was led by lala lajpat rai and sardar bhagat singh .
the outer jail compound was very well guarded .
the trial magistrate was mr f . b . pool , a british judge .
bhagat singh and b . k . dutt were brought into the court at eight minutes past ten .
these slogans created a stir .
the court recorded the shouts and ordered the police to handcuff both the hands of each of the accused .
the newspaper , reporter , reported :
q : were you present in the assembly on the 8th of april , 1929 ?
similarly b . k . dutt also answered the court ' s questions only and declined to make a statement .
the court then heard the defence counsel , who made a masterly speech for about forty minutes , putting forward his arguments .
" punishment can be regarded as retributive , preventive or deterrent .
the offence is particularly a heinous " the agcused have alleged that they hold human life ' sacred ' .
their allegation is negated by their acts .
their attitude throughout has been that their acts are justifiable and justified .
with such an attitude , their acts are those of men who have not fallen into crime on the spur of the moment but by deliberate design .
with such an attitude it is probably that what they have done once , they may attempt to do again .
from the preventive point of view , their offences merit severe punishment .
to a criminal mind , they might suggest imitation . - from the deterrent point of view , the offences demand severe punishment .
the accused are young men but their acts were deliberate and they had made preparations for those acts of a complicated nature .
at times , they even refused to attend the court and had to be forcibly taken there .
in order to overcome these difficulties , particularly to dispense with their presence in the court , the punjab government approached the government of india .
the government of india promulgated an ordinance no . iii on 1st may , 1930 .
the tribunal was invested with special powers to deal with wilful obstruction .
even if death sentence was passed it would not require confirmation by the high court as provided in the code of criminal procedure .
this was an extraordinary procedure and the result was a foregone conclusion .
the proceedings started at 11.00 a . m .
the revolutionaries to be tried came at two minutes past ten .
contemporary records say that : " they shouted revolutionary slogans for a short time and then for a period of eight minutes altogether they chanted a revolutionary hymn . "
you know that in the political field , my views have always differed with those of yours .
i have always been acting independently , without having cared for your approval or disapproval . "
as was known to everybody , the court found bhagat singh and his comrades guilty .
according to the findings of the trial court , the evidence against bhagat singh in the case was three - fold in character :
the rest were sentenced to transportation for life .
they will not be satisfied with a puppet parliament at delhi , eventually set up by the dispensation of the sham at westminster .
nor will they recognise the sovereignty of the british crown even if some day it will be exercised through an indian viceroy .
the british crown presumes to deprive us of this inalienable right .
he also separately dealt with imperialism , national revolution , agrarian revolution and the communist international and its relations with communist parties .
it is a great pity he was not allowed to read his defence in the court .
made in court , it might have received wider publicity and attention all over the world .
the trial was concluded on 6th january , 1932 .
the writings of hume and bentham are quite irrelevant to the present issue , however weighty the opinion of these philosophers may be in academic matters .
m . n . roy was kept throughout in jail since his arrest in 1931 .
he remained unwell in prison and practically in solitary confinement .
by the time the appeal was decided on 2nd may , 1933 , most of his friends had deserted him .
he had to make arrangements for further appeal to privy council .
sir stafford cripps agreed to look into the papers for filing the appeal to the privy council .
he gave the opinion that it would be difficult to get any relief in the privy council .
he said that an unfavourable verdict of the privy council would not only cause harm to the case but may set an adverse precedence in england as well .
the case , in fact , ended with the judgment of the allahabad high court .
roy was an international figure , a distinguished revolutionary .
his defence speech would have been as celebrated as that of emile zola in the dryfus case .
his arguments and research was subsequently utilised in the i . n . a . trial and that of sheikh abdullah .
it had only one aim - to launch a final attack on the foreign power in india and free it from foreign domination .
after the bombing of hiroshima in japan in the middle of 1945 , all resistance of the axis powers broke .
the japanese army surrendered and with it also the officers and soldiers of the indian national army .
some were executed , many were " severely punished and most of the other officeis and soldiers were brought to india .
the government wanted ' to treat them as traitors and punish them accordingly .
but , at the end of the war , the political situation in the country had changed .
the government of india therefore thought it wise to try the officers to prove their guilt before the general public and the world at large .
it was advised to drop charges of sedition and the violation of the oath of allegiance .
the judge advocate very fairly summed up the case of both the prosecution and the defence for the benefit of the court .
the following facts were conclusively proved by the defence :
the sentence of the court on all three accused is transportation for life , cashiering and forfeiture of arrears of pay and allowances .
" no finding or sentence by court martial is complete until confirmed .
" the confirming officer is , however , competent to mitigate , commute or remit the sentences .
this is a principle which it is essential to uphold in the interests of the stability of any government by law established , present or future . "
in dealing with a tribunal of this character , the work of the counsel for the defence became ever so much more difficult .
it was to this end that shriyut bhulabhai used his penetrating intellect and his persuasive eloquence .
no one who reads his speech for the defence can fail to realise that it is an effort worthy of a great and eminent advocate . "
this was the last trial of indian patriots by the british government .
the first trial of bahadur shah zafar was an example of british injustice , the last , an example of justice and fair play .
sheikh muhammad abdullah sheikh muhammad abdullah was born on 5th december , 1905 at soura , a suburb of srinagar .
his father died a fortnight before his birth , leaving behind a widow , six sons and two daughters .
the family was engaged in a modest ' pashmina ' shawl trade .
early in life sheikh abdullah was influenced by islamic teachings and history mainly through his devoutly religious mother and elder brother .
poet iqbal also made a deep impact on him .
on entering politics , he was impressed by the ideas of gandhi , azad , nehru and the ah brothers .
in 1930 , sheikh abdullah organised the youngmen ' s muslim association to campaign for better representation of muslims in government service .
sheikh abdullah was first arrested on 21st september , 1931 .
he was elected president of the muslim conference formed in october , 1932 .
in early 1939 , it was converted into the national conference of which he remained president till 1953 , except for the years 1942 and 1944 .
on his release on 29th september , 1947 , he declared that the people alone and not the ruler could decide the future of the state .
sheikh abdullah mobilised popular resistance against the raiders and support for accession of the state to india .
on 31st october , 1947 , he was apppointed head of the emergency administration and on 5th march , 1948 made the prime minister of the state .
in june , 1949 he joined the constituent assembly of india and was a signatory to the constitution .
his confused and contradictory pronouncements made him a suspect in indian political circles as also among a large section of kashmiris .
with nehru ' s death on 27th may , 1964 , the process of negotiation came to an abrupt end .
" where law is not based on the will of the people , it can lend itself to the suppression of their aspirations .
such law has no moral validity even though it may be enforced for a while .
since then the maharajas were ruling the people of kashmir as their private property .
he pointed out :
the then governor of kashmir resisted transfer , but was finally reduced to subjection with the aid of british .
rapid industrialisation has led to deterioration in the quality of air .
widespread use of coal and fossil fuels in industries and petroleum fuel in motor vehicles has aggravated the air pollution problem .
our atmosphere seems to have become a waste - basket into which dust , npxious fumes , toxic gases and other pollutants are callously thrown .
in russia , a chemical manufacturing complex near leo tolstoy ' s former estate has been discharging chemical vapours and fumes into the air for years .
as a result , oak and pine forests in this renowned tourist area are being destroyed .
india is not free of air pollution though we have a lesser number of vehicles in comparison to the western world .
it is reported that about 25 per cent of the student population in greater calcutta is susceptible to tuberculosis , largely due to the risk of increasing air pollution .
water pollution has acquired dangerous dimensions ever since sewage and industrial effluents are being disposed into the rivers .
the rivers once considered sacred are now turning murky and stink .
in comparison , indian beaches are not so badly affected , however .
inorganic fertilisersnitrogen , phosphates and potashhave been applied in larger quantities to farmlands .
besides fertilisers , numerous pesticides , insecticides and herbicides are also applied .
these substances are reported to contaminate both surface and ground waters .
smog which contains ozone , peroxyacyl nitrates and other photochemical oxidants is reported to produce early maturity or senescence in plants .
exposure to air containing ozone results in the formation of lesions on the upper surfaces of the leaves of certain trees .
ozone flecking is observed in grape , citrus and tobacco plants .
other gaseous pollutants also cause damage to plants .
ammonia and hydrogen sulphide are also phytotoxic .
studies on the effects of air pollution provide information on the chemical nature of air pollutants .
until 1987 , the depletion of ozone layer was not of much concern .
but , after the detection of a hole in the ozone layer in the earth ' s stratosphere over the antarctic made scientists sit up and do serious thinking .
the hole has grown since then and now , it may extend to an area as large as the united states of america .
to add further to the agony , another hole has been detected by canadian scientists and this time over the arctic .
these holes drift around , according to climatic conditions .
not only holes , but also thinning of the ozone layer over the entire surface has been observed .
how do these holes in ozone layer occur ?
what is the reason for thinning of the ozone layer ?
this is probably due to the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( cfc ) worldwide as refrigerants , coolants , propellants in aerosol sprays and plastic foams .
it has to be ensured that the pollution control equipments are operated continuously and rigorously by the industrialists .
many techniques for the control of automobile emissions have been developed . these include tune - ups , catalytic reactors and engine modification .
a tune - up has a significant effect on emission compounds .
for example , a high air - fuel ratio will reduce the concentrations of both carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons .
the catalytic reactor oxidises toxic carbon monoxide to the innocuous carbon dioxide , thereby reducing the nitrogen oxides to nitrogen .
engine modifications have some marked advantages .
in the modified engine , a broad flame is produced for burning of fuel .
intensive research is on the anvil to produce pollution - free engines .
the afflictions include multi - organ damages besides neurological , chromosomal and genetic disorders .
one of the worst air pollution disasters occurred in london , during december 1952 .
a dense fog settled on the city for four days leading to many deaths .
further , a close correlation was found between excess atmospheric concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide and mortality .
in october 1948 there was a catastrophe in donora , pennsylvania ( usa ) in a highly industrial area .
the inhabitants suffered an anomalous weather ( unusually still and stable air ) .
the death toll was 17 in an area where only two deaths were a normal happening in an equivalent period of time .
at poza rica in mexico an industrial accident took place in a refinery in november 1950 .
a peculiar malady from 1924 to 1927 afflicted fishermen along the east ~ coast of prussia , facing the baltic sea , which was ascribed to air pollution .
the condition was termed ' haff disease ' because it afflicted the haff community primarily .
the disease was manifested with muscle cramps and anaemia , resembling arsine gas poisoning .
we all know about rains which shower water .
but , have you ever heard about the rain ' in which acids are showered instead of water ?
rain falls as pure water and on its enroute to the earth , reacts with the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen to form acids .
no doubt , from the industrial emissions where coal and oil are fired , and from automobile exhausts .
acid rain is thus created by industrial activities that pollute the air .
the main sources are electric power plants that use the energy produced by burning coal to generate electricity .
most coal contain small amounts of sulphur , which is converted to sulphur dioxide when the coal is burned .
why are environmentalists so concerned about acid rain ?
acidity or alkalinity of water is measured on ph scale .
as already indicated , rain - water has a ph of less than 7 .
then what is it that makes the ordinary rain - water turn acidic and come down as acid rain ?
the change is brought about due to the gases ( oxides of sulphur ) spewed by industries and automobile exhausts ( oxides of nitrogen ) .
these acid solutions fall to the earth as rain , snow , hail , dew and fog .
a peculiarity of acid rain is that while the causative agents are emitted at one place , the acid rain falls at another .
for example , the pollutants released in england and germany were deposited as acid rain in sweden and norway respectively .
while canada releases much less of pollutant gases in comparison to the united states of america , acid rain tends to occur mostly in canada .
rainfall knows no national boundaries and unlike other types of pollution , acid rain is regarded as a global phenomenon .
since the advent of the industrial revolution in the eighteenth century / man has been engaged in discovering varied sources of energy for manufacturing varied types of materials .
the problem of acid rain started in the early 1950s .
most of the sulphur dioxide remains in the air for a longer time so that more of it is converted to sulphuric acid .
a recent survey indicates that about 150 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide are discharged into the atmosphere every year , which in turn is converted into sulphuric acid .
two - thirds of the acid rain is attributed to the formation of sulphuric acid .
about one - third of the acid rain is due to nitric acid which is formed in the atmosphere by reaction with oxides of nitrogen emitted by vehicles .
it is estimated that each year , about 40 million tonnes of oxides of nitrogen are released into the atmosphere .
most seriously affected is a strip of land running from western new york east into vermont , massachusetts till north carolina .
acid rain is reported to fall even in yellowstone national park and in the wilderness of colorado .
thirty years ago , the forest was a dense canopy of red spruce trees and balm firs .
some of them are 30 metres high and some are centuries old .
it is a sad fact that most of them are dying , turning the forest area into a barren hill .
a similar phenomenon is occurring in many countries of the northern hemisphere like west germany .
it is reported that about 500 million square metres of forest in central europe alone have been damaged by acid rain .
about 20 per cent of the united states lakes are sterilelakes are crystal clear , but lifeless .
who is the culprit for the death of these lakes ?
no doubt , acid rain !
it is reported that trout and salmon have become rare in many lakes and rivers of scandinavia and canada .
when the ph reduces ( i . e . acidity increases ) below 5.5 , fish commonly fail to reproduce .
even breathing becomes a problem because the aluminium compounds accumulate in their gills .
these aluminium compounds are formed by the dissolution of sediments , when the ph of water approaches the acidic limit .
at the same time , the variety and number of small aquatic plants is reduced .
larger plants such as water lilies may disappear .
it has been known for many years that metals such as steel and copper corrode much faster in polluted air than in clean air .
limestone is also attacked by acids and stone buildings and statues are being damaged in many cities .
however , in 1977 they were removed and sent to a museum .
the reason being acid rain .
britain too has suffered from the effects of acid rain as is evident from the erosions on historic buildings at canterbury , oxford and london .
acid rain has added a new dimension to existing international problems .
power stations that utilise coal as fuel must turn to the use of low sulphur coals or fuels with less pollution potential .
the engines may be properly tuned so that the emission from the exhaust is much less .
chemicals and other substances used to control pests are termed as pesticides .
pesticides protect crops against pests but in the process affect man and livestock .
today about 1,000 pesticides are in use by farmers , gardeners / foresters and in homes , industries , godowns and shops .
organophosphorus compounds are biodegradable and do not persist for long periods .
for many years the ill - effects of the pesticides were not known .
careful observation showed that these birds were able to lay only thin - shelled eggs .
ddt accumulates in the human body too .
it is still not known at what extent this build - up becomes harmful .
at chikmagalur in karnataka , people who had eaten crabs were crippled due to pesticides .
further , due to a lack of natural enemies of pests there was a high resurgence of numerous varieties of pests .
some of the measures to avert pesticide pollution are :
educate the farmers to restrict the use of pesticides .
use selective and relatively safe chemicals .
speed up research in inventing biodegradable pesticides .
biologically control pests and introduce newer parasites and predators as enemies of pests .
increase the use of plant - based pesticides , such as neem derivatives .
use artificial pheremones to lure insects and make them sterile .
invent more efficient mechanical devices in addition to the devices available at present ( such as the light trap ) .
above all , scientists have to evince greater interest in developing newer varieties of crops that are resistant to pests .
nature has taken millennia of years to shape this world .
it has bestowed on us a wide variety of materials to live and enjoy .
but man seems determined to destroy the world within this century .
in fact our planet is a water planet as it contains 70 per cent of water , the rest being the earth .
he continues to carry on with his policy of ' murder ' .
the major pollutants threatening the sanctity of our water resources are industrial effluents , sewage and farm wastes .
as such industrial , municipal and agricultural pollution along with ground - water and ocean pollution will be discussed in this chapter .
it was taken for granted that rivers and lakes were logical places to dump refuse .
industrial activities generate a wide variety of waste products which are generally discharged into water courses .
all kinds of industries , founded during the past four decades , discharge effluents of varied nature .
as technology develops , newer types of wastes are generated .
this makes the control of chemical pollutants very difficult .
in holland , for instance , the rhine river is called the ' sewer of europe ' .
by the time the rhine reaches the coast of holland , it is 20 per cent sewage and industrial waste .
inorganic wastes include acids , alkalis , dyes , heavy metals , toxic substances ( such as cyanide ) and gaseous pollutants .
organic compounds also constitute a larger proportion of industrial wastes .
the table below gives an idea of the type of effluent discharged by a particular industry .
table 2 types of effluents discharged by industries no .
industries important constituents of the effluent 1 .
lead , mineral acids .
sulphite , free chlorine .
alkalis , free chlorine , fats , oil and grease .
pesticides and allied toxic sub - stances , mineral acids .
hydrocarbons , phenols , fats , oil and grease .
biological pollutants include bacteria , viruses , plants and animals .
the impact of these pollutants on human health and fish life , etc . are dealt in the following pages .
acids : both organic and inorganic acids are discharged into rivers in the form of industrial effluents .
ammonia acts like poison to fish when it enters the body through the gills .
the presence of excess amount of . free chlorine in water courses is undesirable because it is a powerful irritant .
hydrogen sulphide emits a foul smell which is commonly felt when nearing rivers and streams .
even a concentration of 0.001 ppm of hydrogen sulphide in the water can emit the smell of rotten egg .
oils : replacement of coal by oil as a fuel has aggravated the problem of pollution .
oil has a tendency to spread over the surface of water , thus inhibiting the diffusion of oxygen into water .
oil is reported to coat the gills of fish and affect their respiration .
oil is pushed to the shore by water currents and winds , thus spoiling the beaches and making bathing or swimming impossible .
out of this nearly 1,150 are dead and the unlucky ones are those who survived but with permanent disabilities .
even the unborn foetus in the mother ' s womb was not spared .
most forms of inorganic mercury are converted to methyl mercury by micro - organisms under certain conditions in an aquatic environment .
these small fishes are in turn eaten up by larger fishes whose bodies then receive more mercury .
mercury enters and remains in the brain , causing damage .
it can affect liver function and cause diabetes and hypertension .
cadmium ranks next to mercury in its toxicity .
the principal contributor of cadmium is the electroplating industry .
it tends to accumulate in the liver , kidneys and thyroid and causes high blood pressure , cramps , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
cadmium tends to be absorbed by suspended particles and settles to the bottom of the source of water .
for this reason , even in polluted , rivers , the cadmium levels in the water may not be detectable but can have serious consequences .
the toxic effects of arsenic on humans are not known yet .
since the tissues build up a tolerance to arsenic , death takes place only when consumed in excess .
the symptoms of metal poisoning came to light at a later stage only .
under the situation prevailing in india , the symptoms would be mistaken as a consequence of poverty .
it may also enter the water supply due to the use of lead pipes or plastic pipes which have been stabilised with lead compounds .
both lead and arsenic damage the chromosomes , thus interfering with the process of heredity .
lead above the level of 40 microgrammes per 100 grammes of blood causes brain damage in children .
during 1977 a number of cattle died at malappadu , a village in andhra pradesh .
most species of fish can adapt themselves to a fairly wide range of water temperature , provided the tempera - hire change occurs gradually .
sharp changes in temperature such as sudden rise or decrease are often harmful .
the temperature changes not only affect fish but also the entire aquatic ecosystem .
the activities of pathogenic organisms are accelerated by higher temperatures and they become more virulent .
as such , if one or two species disappear , the ecosystem may not have sufficient diversity left to compensate for the loss .
the problem has assumed serious dimensions during the past 50 years particularly with the increase in pollution due to ever - increasing population .
the natural purification mechanisms of the oceans cannot degrade it as plastics are non - biodegradable material .
turtles and fish which mistake plastic as edible material swallow it and upon swallowing , suffocate and die .
in 1986 , the us academy of sciences noted that the world ' s merchant ships dump at least 6.6 tonnes of trash overboard annually .
in 1972 , nations including the usa agreed to ban dumping of plastic into the oceans .
but the treaty failed to consider the dumping of ordinary garbage which contains large amounts of plastic items .
the developed countries woke up to the dangers of pollution in the 1950s when the thames river in england became heavily polluted and sterile .
the river ganges is further polluted by lakhs of devotees taking a dip all along its course .
dead bodies and carcasses floating over its surface is a common sight .
it is stated that every year about 30,000 bodies are burnt on the banks of the ganges .
ashes and partly burnt ( or unburnt ) bodies are discharged into the river , turning it into a mere drain or cesspool .
effluents discharged into cauvery from these industries is estimated to be about 110 million litres per day .
there are about 400 tanneries in tamil nadu of which 260 units are located in the north arcot district .
calcutta was known as the ' city of palaces ' and the ' city of gardens ' in the early part of this century .
pollution of water by industrial wastes has led to a rise in the incidence of gastro - enteric diseases .
this accounts for the high rate of infant mortality in the slums where almost half of the city ' s population lives . "
the condition of some major lakes in india is no better .
adding to the burden is the immersion into the lake of ganesh idols made of plaster of paris during the ganesh chaturthi festival every year .
however , the andhra pradesh pollution control board has recently woken up to ban such immersions .
the dal lake in jammu &amp; kashmir is covered with weeds .
this is a recent phenomenon caused by tourists who throw left - overs of their meals into the lake .
fed on this waste food , the weeds have grown abundantly , turning the lake into a ghastly spot .
the loktak lake in eastern india ( manipur ) is the world ' s only floating sanctuary .
it is under serious peril and may dry up soon .
denudation of forests and severe soil erosion have led to heavy siltation of the lake .
experts say that if the lake is not dredged , it will soon become a playground .
renuka , a picturesque lake in himachal pradesh , contains abundant varieties of fish , tortoise and crocodiles .
the beautiful chilka lake in orissa is choked with vegetation and needs to be attended on a war - footing .
prevention and control of water pollution the principal contributors of water pollution are industrial effluents and sewage .
the time is ripe to plunge into speedy action to avert any major disaster .
effluent treatment systems have to be incorporated as an integral part of the industry .
in addition some of the following measures can also be adopted :
process modification : switching over to new techniques that need no water is highly beneficial .
the remaining towns have no such facility and this is leading to increase in water - borne diseases and epidemics .
treatment of sewage alone is not the only criterion for checking pollution .
every citizen has to realise that pollution starts from the house .
water , the elixir of life , is a priceless commodity and should not be wasted .
without water , there can be no life on the earth .
after the discovery of oil it became the prime fuel to be used in every sector .
unfortunately this fuel is not available in all parts of the world .
most countries have to import oil from the oil - rich nations who in turn have to transport millions of tonnes of oil daily .
since transportation by road or by air is not feasible , oil is transported by ships .
to cater to global requirements , ships carry oil across the waterways .
the main routes are across the arabian sea .
the first such accident occurred in 1967 .
these hillocks , if heaped together , will form mountains .
massive amounts of solid wastes are disposed of each day by our consumer society .
the usa , the world ' s largest consumer nation , has the most serious solid waste problem .
these solid wastes have become an integral part of our life .
needless to say these wastes devour our precious landscape and spoil the aesthetics of the surroundings .
any unwanted and / or discarded material thrown away in solid form that has arisen from the normal community activity is solid waste .
1 recycling is the utilisation of wastes as raw materials in the manufacture of new products .
similarly various types of plastic materials ' are melted to mould into various useful articles .
this is a biological method of decomposing the organic solid wastes under aerobic conditions .
this compost is an excellent soil conditioner .
cow dung in new exclusively utilised in the production of bio - gas .
the used dung slurry can be reused as manure .
but we are unable to convert it into energy .
however , in bombay a fuel pellet station has been set up , where the garbage is processed before incineration .
th ' s plant is expected to produce 80 tonnes of fuel pellets per day , out of the 150 tonnes of garbage fed .
the pellet may be used as an industrial and domestic fuel .
if the plant proves successful , many such waste - to - energy plants can be installed elsewhere too .
this is particularly feasible in low - lying areas around a city .
in this method refuse is dumped in pits and covered with layers of earth .
land reclaimed by this method can be conveniently utilised for parks , playgrounds and other light structures .
( this method should not be adopted for areas having a high ground - water table , as the water may get contaminated in due course ) .
the slag wastes ( from metal extraction industries ) may be used to fill the quarries and mines and the landscape may thus be restored .
incineration and pyrolysis are some other methods practised at certain places .
incineration is burning of the waste material to produce a residue that may not pose any health hazard .
pyrolysis is also burning in the absence of oxygen .
keeping the city clean is the prime duty of every citizen , and the measures suggested can be fruitful in achieving the goal .
certain substances ( elements and particles ) are capable of degrading by themselves and releasing energy in the form of radiation .
such radiation is not visible to our eyes , but it can penetrate our body and do immense harm .
on 6 august , 1945 the first atomic bomb was dropped over hiroshima in japan .
wastes from nuclear power plants do not give off offensive odour nor do they release any obnoxious gases .
despite these advantages , wastes from nuclear power plants are considered dangerous .
the cause of the problem is that nuclear waste becomes harmless only after millions of years .
the plutonium produced during power generation ( 200 kg per year per reactor ) is sufficient to cause cancer in every human being .
constant exposure to radiation causes genetic defects and can affect the generations to come .
radio - tracers are extensively used in the fields of medicine , industry , agriculture and biology to determine the course of chemical and biochemical reactions .
substances administered to patients and used in radiation therapy are now proving important sources of nuclear harm .
radiation from x - rays , colour tv sets , luminous dials of clocks and watches , x - ray fluoroscope are further aggravating the situation .
forests cover approximately one - fifth of the total land area of the indian peninsula .
the wildlife inhabiting the indian forests is rich in number and variety .
they provide oxygen without which life is not possible on earth .
they maintain a healthy gaseous balance in the atmosphere .
they are great moderators of climate .
plants increase the humidity of water vapour from their exposed surfaces by way of transpiration .
as one may be aware , forests extensively control soil erosion and landslides .
forests in the hilly areas keep the soil of river banks intact with their extensive root system .
they also maintain the stability of the mountain slopes .
the aerial parts of the plants intercept rain , decreasing its erosive power .
our paper pulp , rayon and plywood industries are completely dependent on forest produce .
trees provide drugs , spices , fruit , fibres , gums , resins , rubber and latex .
it is estimated that our national income via these products and timberwood is more than 600 crores of rupees per annum .
about 40 million tribals have their homes in the forests all over the country .
they not only carry out forestry operations but also constitute an integral part of the forest environment .
some of their basic necessities , viz . food , fodder and shelter are met by the forests .
over tne years , the population has increased to reach stupendous figures .
consequently , the need for fuel and timber has increased manifold leading to the felling of millions of trees .
in the name of production and development , trees are cut down and the forest areas made clear .
exploitation practices which destroy the very resource base on which the people ' s future rests is like killing a ' golden goose ' .
every year we are losing a fertile soil of 5,300 million tonnes , that is equivalent to the loss of 30 to 50 million tonnes of foodgrain .
if forest cover is depleted at such a rate ( 750 million sq m / year ) then the problem of soil erosion would assume enormous proportions .
forests play an important role in the conservation of water .
roots of trees hold together the soil which absorbs water .
the top soil is very fertile and nothing can grow without it . it takes nature thousands of years to create a thin layer of top soil .
as a result , reservoirs lose their storage capacity ( already many of our reservoirs are silted heavily ) .
trees are like our limbs ; each time one is cut , our chances of survival get reduced .
the government has woken up and is engaged in various afforestation schemes .
acts to conserve - forests have been enforced .
afforestation programmes have to be stepped up further , though at present two movements to conserve forests have become popular in india .
o god , take back thy boon ! "
in the meanwhile , " o child , go back to thy mad festival . "
his heart was restless " like a serpent reviving from its long winter ' s sleep . "
arjuna , began to wonder who this other chitra was .
but arjuna ' s curiosity had been aroused and he begged chitra to let him meet the princess .
this was to happen again and again in his life .
a letter written to his niece indira on the eve of his departure from london is significant .
she gives up her chase of him and marries the fourth character in the novel , sribilash , the narrator , who is deeply in love with her .
he returns to his humanitarian mission in calcutta , a sadder and wiser man .
i am carrying , as it were , my tentson my back , instead of living in them . "
the brave music of the distant drum was calling him .
there were new worlds to explore , fresh minds to meet .
he felt he had something to say and his voice must reach the world ' s conscience .
in hong kong he was even more impressed with the grace and strength which physical labour , well regulated , can impart to the human body .
chitra , secretly pleased , promised to introduce the princess to him .
she begged the gods to take back her false beauty .
the play comes to end with arjuna ' s words , " beloved , my life is full . "
it deals with romantic effusions and matrimonial predicaments of three young intellectuals and their ladies .
the dialogue scintillates with witits native idiom hard to render in another medium .
he received a great ovation from all the political leaders gathered on the occasion .
this was only one of many such cases he espoused and each caused him considerable emotional stress .
death is the obverse side of life , it is one with it , and i do not look upon it with any particular fear .
in palataka the poet has come down to earth and broods on life ' s pathos and irony , its fugitive joys and fragile claims .
it is narrated by the husband whose 23 - year old wife binu has fallen seriously ill and is advised change of air by the doctor .
the big eyes in her wasted face shine with delight as they now travel together by train westwards .
two months later binu dies , full of gratitude to her husband for filling the last days of her life with perfect happiness .
so strict was the censorship on press , so heavy the iron curtain thai no news of the tragedy and the subsequent horrors was made public for several weeks .
he then did what his own conscience dictated .
the british ruling authorities never forgave what they deemed an unheard - of impertinence .
the sweet singer who had been content with his jone pilgrimage between his nest and the sky had now been caught in the world ' s mesh .
to break the lamp of any people is to deprive it of its rightful place in the world festival . "
once india had such a mind which was lit by its own flame , fed with its own oil .
today the university graduates had become little better than " rag - pickers at other people ' s dustbins . "
we then imagine that our salvation lies in a selection of the best points of each , patched together in an eclectie perfection .
we forget that the european universities are living , organic parts of the life of europe , where each found its natural birth .
tagore now had an additional incentive to travel .
he was restless .
the world ' s adulation was like an intoxicant ; he wanted more of it .
the satirical pieces are full of irony and wisdom without bitterness .
so a golden cage had to be built for it and learned pundits engaged to devise suitable system of teaching .
" that would be ungodly , " protests man , " thus to encourage ferocity . "
these are the two hemispheres of the brain of mankind . if one is paralysed the whole body degenerates . "
on 15 may 1920 tagore sailed for europe , accompanied by his son and daughter - in - law .
in england he was happy to meet old acquaintances and to make new ones .
he could , however , sense that the atmosphere was not as cordial as one his earlier visit before the war .
a co - passenger on board was the agha khan who would recite to him hafiz and other persian poets .
i am willing to give the whole of london away for corner in santiniketan .
but in so far as he had any hopes of raising large funds for his university he was disappointed .
our trust in bigness very often betrays our want of faith in truth . "
its message went deep into my heart .
it said to me : ' the cup of milk comes to you unasked when you have gone through your tapasya ' . . .
in march 1921 tagore returned to london from where he flew to paris , his first experience of air flight .
from paris he went to strasbourg to address the newly established french university on the " message of the forest " .
proceeding to geneva he spoke at the rousseau institute on " education " .
tagore who had been denouncing this very aspect of nationalism in other countries found the sight extremely painful in his own .
to me humanity is rich and large and many - sided . "
disciples take from the master not what he wishes to give but what they wish to take .
the " deep concern " was not merely verbal and poetic .
his programme of community development was therefore based on the twin principles of self - help and enlightenment .
their misery and apathy were evidence enough that no misfortune was greater than ignorance , no sin greater than to revel in it .
tagore is right from the point of view of eternity .
he lives in eternity .
but the demands of the present are imperious . "
gandhi replied to the poet ' s challenge in a powerful rejoinder published in his young india .
finally , worked up to a moral passion , he admonishes the poet for fiddling when the house is on fire .
he presents to our admiring gaze the beautiful picture of the birds in the early morning singing hymns of praise as they soar into the sky .
but i have had the pain of watching birds who for want of strength could not be coaxed even into a flutter of their wings .
the human bird under the indian sky gets up weaker than when he pretended to retire .
" give them work that they may eat .
' why should i , who have no need to work for food , spin ? ' may be the question asked .
trace the source of every coin that finds its way into your pocket , and you will realise the truth of what i write .
let him burn his foreign clothes ; that is the duty today .
god will take care of the tomorrow . "
who does not sympathise with gandhi ' s passionate emotion and share it ?
tagore himself used to attend levi ' s classes .
tagore also made a gift to it of the copyright on his bengali books published till then .
the nobel prize money had already been donated by him to the school .
the background of the play is the political subjection of the people of sivtarai to the neighbouring kingdom of uttarakut .
its engine - tower dominated die landscape and outsoared die trident of the temple of siva on mountain peak .
this remarkable play was never staged .
what was originally planned as hermitage was becoming a cosmopolitan beehive .
whether this picturesque beehive produced more honey than buzzing , it is difficult to say .
much pioneering work was also done of which the benefit was reaped , not only by visva - bharati but by many other universities .
not content with touring in his own country , he now thought of visiting china .
nearly a thousand years had passed since the last band of buddhist monks had carried their master ' s message of compassion and peace to that land .
tagore wanted to restore the ancient cultural link between the two countries which had been snapped for so long .
he could not have , for china and india had in the meanwhile drifted too far away , and each land was seething in its own ferment .
the chinese intelligentsia had grown impatient of traditional values and virtues and were western - oriented .
they were more amenable to the rational scepticism of a bertrand russell than die mystic insights of a rabindranath tagore .
they looked upon the indian poet as a reactionary idealist , a futile visionary and viewed his visit with indifference , if not with hostility .
he followed no known model or pattern there was none in his own country and its literary tradition .
the genesis of some of them is referred to in the letters he wrote during this period .
kusum loved water as though she belonged there .
days passed .
he forgot his mission and was once again the lover and the singer .
not sermons but poems poured out of his pen exquisite in their wistful tenderness .
the 63 - year old poet was entering the evening of his life and the mellow richness of the evening melody pervades these poems .
the visit to peru had to be cancelled on the doctor ' s advice .
sweet memories will restore to the flute its lost melody . . .
her language i knew not , but what her eyes said shall forever remain eloquent in its anguish .
on 4january 1925 the poet and his companion elmhirst bade goodbye to their hostess and sailed from buenos aires .
he hurried away for he felt guilty that he should be happy and enjoying himself when his country needed him .
" you express regret in your letter that i could not continue to stay in that beautiful house near the river till the end of the summer .
you do not know how often i wish i could do so .
a few days after his return to his country tagore ' s elder brother jyotirindranath passed away .
the main action centres in a simple religious emotion which rises to a high pitch as the story ends in a tragedy of martyred devotion .
true worship is the surrender or dedication of die best we have to the call of trutii .
the sage dedicates his learning , the man of action his deeds , the poet his songs , and the humble nati her dance .
one other point of interest to note about this play is that it has no male characters .
the introduction of the buddhist monk in the prologue was a later addition to enable the author to satisfy the public clamour for his appearance on the stage .
he was also received by king victor emmanuel iii and attended a performance of his play chitra in italian .
but more than the king or the duce , tagore was keen on meeting the philosopher benedetto croce who was at that time virtually home - interned in naples .
some common friends , however , took the risk of bringing him over clandestinely to rome where the two met .
then immediately recovering his light - hearted good humour , he added : " can you lend me an aeroplane if you have one at your disposal ?
the psychological interest of the novel lies in the gradual and almost imperceptible transformation in the husband ' s feelings towards her .
the end of this novel is , unfortunately , weak a failing which many other novels of tagore share .
even as he was writing this novel and probing the spiritual hollowness of mere success , he was himself getting restless for fresh fields to conquer .
in the process he manages to strike a new romantic attitude .
the struggle makes of him a curiously pathetic figureone who is being worked against his grain .
sensing the tragedy , she releases him from his troth and disappears from his life .
the last poem in which she takes farewell of her lover is a testament of the depth of feeling of which she was capable .
it was in this year too that tagore began his experiments in an entirely new and unforeseen medium of creative expression , painting .
but though he did not wield the brush , he doodled freely with his pen .
kusum told her name .
then suddenly kusum disappeared again and did not come to the ghat or to the temple for a long time .
one day the sanyasi sent for her and she came and sat before him with downcast eyes .
when the sanyasi cross - questioned her she confessed that she had a dream in which she found the sanyasi making love to her .
when he recovered , his poise he begged of kusum to forget him and disappeared from the village .
kusum slowly came down the steps and stood looking at the water .
' if i had not come to russia , " he wrote in a letter , " life ' s pilgrimage would have remained incomplete .
they are striving to destroy the power of the powerful and the wealth of the wealthy . why should we be afraid of that ?
and why should we be angry ?
this is one of his earliest stories and a very characteristic one .
in a similar vein the highway tells the story of what it has seen of secret longings and frustrated loves .
in almost all these stories the author ' s tenderness and sympathies seem to be monopolised by women generally young girls , and little children .
and so the dreaded kabuliwalla becomes in tagore ' s story of that name one of the most lovable characters in bengali fiction .
the body fades into a shadow , melts into a point and loses itself into darkness without end . . . "
but there is no regret , for the has seen the farthest limit of being and is struck with wonder .
not all the poems are self - exploratory or introspective .
he is angry and would like to hurl an " imprecation upon this cannibal whose gruesome hunger spares neither women nor children . . "
he would like to utter words of peace and love and compassion , but is afraid they would sound even more futile .
there on his birthday he wrote a magnificent poem with which began a new book of poems published later in the year as senjuti ( evening lamp ) .
" a foreign girl sings in a foreign voice . "
in another poem called " station " he is fascinated by the comings and goings of bustling passengers on the platform .
and in the end will everything disappear and melt into the great void , like a discarded pot when the meal is over ?
why ?
he was not in the least proud of all that he had done a true christian ! "
part of the summer was spent , as in . the year before , at mungpoo and kalimpong .
his dearly beloved nephew surendranath had died in calcutta .
was there such manifestation anywhere else in this vast universe of myriad suns and planets ?
he expressed his horror , puzzlement and anguish in two poems he wrote there in the latter half of may .
why do men seemingly civilised turn suddenly into dangerous maniacs ?
he is hurt , humiliated and unhappy , but does not fume or curse .
he is in a chastened , meditative mood , inclined to view his fellow - men ' s misdeeds in the wide perspective of history .
he will not give up hope altogether . the drums sound , signalling time for change of the storm - tossed age .
a new chapter , heartless , will begin , but however dismal the present , the poet cannot give up hope for the future .
faith in the ultimate perfectibility of man , in the essential divinity of his spirit , is the desperate need of tagore ' s own soul .
having vented his anguish and affirmed his faith in the only medium of which he was master , he was not content .
his own country was in a sulky and frustrated mood and on the verge of a desperate decision .
a free india would be an asset to the free world , an enslaved india merely a burden and a liability .
pending the arrival of indian doctors from calcutta , the british civil surgeon from darjeeling was frantically begged to come .
he came reluctantly and having examined the patient , gruffly inquired if he understood english .
no sadder instance can be cited of the rapidly increasing alienation of the british ruling class from the people of the land .
he diagnosed kidney infection and insisted on performing then and there a drastic surgical operation , if the unconscious patient ' s life was to be saved .
he looked helplessly at mahadev desai and the tears streamed down his cheeks .
he was always so self - controlled that even in the hardest bereavement and sorrow i had never seen him break down .
now he was never to recover the full use of his faculties , but was soon able to sit up in bed and to talk .
" how artificial and unreal are our notions of sin and virtue ! " he wrote in 1894 .
" there is no higher religion than that of sympathy for all that lives .
too weak to deliver it himself , it was read for him in his presence .
" the wheels of fate will one day compel the british to give up their indian empire .
but what kind of india will they leave behind , what stark misery ?
when the stream of their two centuries ' administration runs dry at last , what a waste of mud and filth they will leave behind them ! "
but even in the darkest gloom tagore ' s testament could not end in a note of despair .
the school was his first love which he had . somewhat ignored when the glamorous visva - bharati came on the scene .
now the old solicitude returned .
hewenton to recall how he used to lose himself in joy when teaching children .
he could not get over his amusement at being fed on glaxo and would refer to himself as " glaxo baby . "
since then each time glaxo was brought , he would inquire , " how many months old am i today ? "
the trees were perhaps his oldest love .
immobilised again in his last months , he would watch with wistful tenderness the graceful shimool outside his cottage in santiniketan .
during the summer drought he was distressed at the fate of the trees in the asrama .
the trees must be saved at all cost .
when it grows , you will see how santal women will gather under it to pick the flowers from which they make their wine . "
he kept the bunch near his bed and would tempt the visitor , ' just try one and see how sweet my jambus taste .
may you be revealed as the sun is revealed dispersing the veil of mist ,
may the unending wonder of the endless be made manifest , proclaiming life ' s victory !
when faith asserts its robustness : death , like rahu ,
it was not a blind for self - deception .
nor will he , in the bitterness of frustrated arrogance or self - pity , deny or repudiate the terrible beauty of truth .
a week after his birthday he muses again on . the mystery of creation , looks steadily , without blinking .
these poems dictated before his death were published posthumously as sesh lekha ( last writing ) .
as a religious institution and place of worship , the temple in india has had a hoary past .
this was according to the local needs and credal requirements and subject , of course , to the interplay or exchange of thoughts and ideas .
besides the relief sculpture they carry inscriptions of the seventh - eighth centuries and later .
some of the platforms had a post , or kandu , representing the deity planted over them .
we are also told that many came here to worship with offerings or bali .
the buddha - pitikai or dharma - pitikai as the object of worship by the buddhists is referred to in the tamil epic , manimekalai .
the remains of another chaitya noticed near vidyadharapuram , near vijayawada , are of like nature .
the circular chaitya is brick - built .
the massive wall has a stepped up base provided with a narrow vestibule for approach in front , resembling the antarala of later temples .
several subsidiary shrines of identical shape also exist there .
the structures after which such excavations were made were , therefore , essentially apsidal temples .
these belong to the period between the second century bc and the second century ad .
the rest belong to the period after the fourth century ad .
they were excavated in the time of the vakatakas , mostly between ad 450 and 600 .
the last ones were excavated around ad 650 .
the activity in general , and particularly the embellishments , however , continued till the times of the rashtrakutas in the eighth - ninth centuries ad .
the early chaityas are large , apsidal , with an elaborate facade , having horseshoe - shaped windows on the top of the entrance ,
a rock - cut stupa , in the apse portion , formed the object of worship .
the rock architecture of the second phase consists of two apsidal chaityas ( 19 and 26 ) .
the sanctum contains a large figure of the buddha , often with other sculptures in the ardha - mandapa .
in the case of cave 27 , the ardha - mandapa is advanced into the maha - mandapa .
in a temple complex with such an axial arrangement , the sanctum does not appear to have had a superstructure of the pyramidal type .
he felt its immediacy and its intimacy and addressed it as the lord of his life , his jivan - devata .
in his famous poem of that name he says , " o my inmost being , is your thirst quenched by coming into my heart ?
the first cave - temple was , as a result , bold and ambitious in design and of larger dimensions .
rock architecture was also sustained longer as a mode in the northern zone .
but rock architecture soon became a mere second to structural stone constructions in the southern zone of the chalukyas as would be seen in the sequel .
the mandapa in front of the early cave - temples has more bays laterally on the transverse axis and only one bay at either end of the long axis .
such early structural temples are the ladkhan in aihole and the kallamatha in badami .
it would be evident that this feature in rock architecture is after the contemporary and earlier brick - and - timber structural models .
in badami there are four cave - temples excavated at various heights on the vertical scarp of the sandstone rock .
the sanctum entrance is guarded by huge dvarapalas .
caves 20 , 22 , 23 and 24 , adjacent to this , would also belong to about the same period .
the ravana - ki - kai ( cave 14 ) is of a simpler plan , with a large pillared mandapa and a sandhara shrine at its rear .
the pillars are of the kumbha - valli type .
on either side of the shrine entrance , there are a number of carved images , including the two dvarapalas .
on the mandapa walls , and carved in the recesses between the pilasters , are sculptural compositions , saivite and vaishnavite .
this excavation in the pre - rashtrakuta series can be dated near ad 700 .
cave 25 , or the kumbharvada , has multiple shrine - cells as in bhokardan and has lateral galleries attached to the antechamber .
it is apparently a case of reconditioning of what all was prepared and cut out for buddhistic requirements .
it would mark the earliest example of rashtrakuta work at ellora .
its front pavilion carries the inscription of dantidurga ( c . 752 - 756 ) and is an accomplished piece of contemporary rock architecture .
the detached nandi - mandapa is four - pillared with flights of steps at the front and the rear .
the linga - pitha is circular .
they follow mostly the earlier hindu examples in plan and design , differing only in their sculpture and iconography .
the indra sabha ( cave 32 ) and the jagannath sabha ( cave 33 ) standing close together , are both two - storeyed excavations .
the indra sabha has in its open forecourt the chaumukh jain monolithic temple .
the lower storey of the cave is an unfinished hall , mostly with simple pillars , some of them moulded .
the hall has a pillared portico , and there are two side shrines projecting on either side of the front .
the jagannath sabha , though of the same type , lacks the regularity of the plan .
the only exception is the aberrant undavalli cave - temple which is dedicated to vishnu .
the nandi in saiva cave - temples is rock - cut as in the pandyan examples farther south .
in point of time the akkanna - madanna cave at vijayawada in its present form comes first .
the last , if not of direct eastern chalukyan vintage , can at best be of telugu - chola authorship .
these cave - temples essentially consist of a rock - cut hall , or mandapa , with one or more , often three , shrine - cells behind .
the pillars are usually simple , thick - set , short and square in section throughout , or have their middle height bevelled at the corners .
this results in the middle section being octagonal , while the basal and apical sections are square in plan .
often the additional mandapa was an unattached auxiliary structure standing separately in the forecourt inside the prakara .
the rest of the figure sculpture was accommodated even on the pillars of the mandapa .
with the increasing importance and elaboration of rituals and multiplication of festivals , additions , both axial and peripheral , were made to this nuclear structure .
in cases , like the brihadisvara at thanjavur , the entire temple complex was planned and designed at the same time and executed almost simultaneously .
the phalaka , large , thick and square in earlier forms , became polygonal or circular and thinner and smaller in later temples .
it supports the corbel - bracket or block , potika , which carries the beam , or uttira .
thus there are the squatting or rearing vyalas ( mythical lion - like forms with transformed faces ) , elephants , nagas , nagadevas , bhutas , etc .
in the earlier series of temples mostly the alpa and jati vimanas prevailed .
the gateways also tended to increase in height and size , ultimately to become the dominating structures of the temple complex .
this was a sequel to the experience they gained in the cutting in of cave - temples in hard stone .
in the buddha , according to him , the hindu race and thought had achieved its finest flowering .
he was to write many poems and plays drawing on buddhist legends and motifs .
malini , the king ' s daughter in the play , is his first major buddhist heroine .
" pity is beautiful like the yonder moon that casts its spell in the sky , but is that the only enduring reality ?
the two smallest ones lack the prastara part .
thus this ratha alone would illustrate the various forms of nasikas as described in the texts .
the smaller vimana is three - storeyed , all square on plan , but with octagonal griva and sikhara and stupi on top .
while the aditala is devoid of the hara elements on top , it has , like the top tola , four seated bhutas placed at the corners blowing conches .
the hara elements are found over the second tala on all the four sides , and again over the ardha - mandapa in front of the aditala .
the pilasters on the walls have rearing lion bases , as is characteristic of the rajasimha temples .
the corresponding oblong attachment on the east with the passage through it , forms the antarala entrance to the main sanctum .
the two lateral shrines facing east as also the rear shrine facing west are like the main sanctum , dedicated to siva .
' it was built of hard black stone in the ninth century in the time of pallava aparajitavarman , one of the last rulers of the dynasty .
the oblong form with sala sikhara became the invariable rule , according to prescription and practice , for all the devi shrines .
his short stories created a new form in literature and set a standard which has not been surpassed in indian literary achievement not even by his own later stories .
apart from his creative prose , the range and quantity of his reflective prose of the period is astonishing .
the second tola of the vimana has a similar hara of four kutas and four salas .
the cardinal faces of the griva have four nasikas of equal size .
beneath its cloak of benevolence the sword rattled .
in 1898 the sedition bill was passed to stifle nationalist agitation and the great scholar - patriot , tilak , was arrested .
he raised his powerful voice against the repressive policy of the government and actively participated in raising funds for tilak ' s defence .
while the transversely designed mukha - mandapa as also the connecting transept rise in four storeys , the maha - mandapa was originally three - storeyed .
the top storey was evidently an open terrace , with a row of nandis placed on the coping of its walls .
plato ' s approval of rabindranath would have been short - lived in any case .
the square vimana with a boldly moulded adhishthana over a high upa - pitha is likewise sandhara in its two vertical lower talas .
the brihadisvara vimana of gangaikonda - cholapuram differs from its predecessor and supposed model of the same name in thanjavur in one important respect .
it has only a single entrance on the east on both the functional lower storeys and is not chaturmukha or sarvatobhadra as the thanjavur temple is .
this is an aesthetic achievement , resulting from the clever interposition of octagonal kutas in the hara elements of the upper talas as karnakutas at the corners .
internally , however , it lacks the other embellishments , namely , the paintings and depiction of dances .
the smaller temple units , called the uttara kailasa and dakshina kailasa on either side of the main vimana , also belong to about the same period .
the adhishthana tiers of the vimana antamla and mandapa are profusely carved with long lines of friezes of animals , men and narrative scenes .
the overhanging kapota of the mandapa is supported by numerous finely - carved female figures in graceful poses called madanikas .
the superstructure of the main vimana is now lost .
the temple thus is a veritable museum of sculptures , large and small , and intricate vegetal , floral and animal carvings .
the sikhara on top also appears to have been square .
it consists of the vimana facing east and open mukha - mandapa connected by an antarala .
the mandapa is of the navaranga pattern with four central pillars round the centre of the floor and twelve more pillars on the periphery .
adjacent to the namesvara is a triple - shrined unit with three shrines opening on the south , west and north of a common mukha - mandapa .
the three shrines , all alike , are comparatively plain structures built of large slabs of stone with no decorations on their exterior .
the shrines named namesvara , kamesvara and kachesvara ( now called mukkanti siva temple ) were built by nami reddi at the beginning of the thirteenth century .
the ruined brickwork superstructure has lost many of its distinctive features .
the temple complex at ghanapur ( warangal district ) inside the mud - fort at the centre of the village is another example of a kakatiya temple complex .
axially there is a ruined mandapa in front of the eastern porch .
the surrounding parivara shrines are of varied character , with or without a front mandapa .
some of them have tiered superstructures still extant with sukanasika projections , in some of which the kuta sola elements of the southern vimana are evident .
many of them have square sikharas .
in one case at least the crowning part is of the amalaka type .
the two small temples at katachpur ( kataksliapura ) in the same district are trikuta with their superstructures lost .
the superstructure over the stone - built body in many cases , especially the larger temples , is of brick and mortar .
these miniature shrine tops here and elsewhere are of the vimana type with a square or circular sikhara or of the prasada type with an amalaka on top .
there are nearly fifty temples of the kakatiyas known , but they are mostly in various stages of ruination .
a few of these temples , however , are of the kadarnba - chalukya vimana pattern which have been dealt with separately .
some of their temples are remarkable for the great size of their component structures , i . e . the mandapas and gapuras .
seeing an humble cottage nearby she ordered her companions to set fire to it .
the king sent for the queen and asked her how she could do a thing like that .
the queen smiled and said , " the loss is negligible " .
" go and earn or beg your livelihood , " he said to her .
" only then you will understand how great was the loss of the poor man whose cottage was burnt down for your moment ' s pleasure .
after you have made enough to rebuild the cottage , i shall take you back as my queen . "
thus it would be seen that the temple was founded within a few years after the foundation of vijayangar , the city and the empire .
the temple built in the local reddish granite is easily the largest among early vijayanagar temples , consisting of the sanctum and axial mandapa combined into one unit .
the outer , curved apse ends face east and west respectively .
in the language of the people he found at last his own true language and made it the language of literature .
the " incomparable one " might well have been the bengali reader , too , along with his muse .
his offering to the new century was very different .
several of them were included later in the english gitanjali .
he has realised his own helplessness and will henceforth seek his light only from him .
all else is because he is .
" let thy lamp burn in my home . mine only heats the air and throws out foul smoke . "
i was in their power , what could i do ?
they came suddenly and made me a prisoner .
i found myself in such a predicament that i was weary of my life , while my officials had no hope of their ' s being spared .
i took nothing from them , nor did they bring any of the plunder to me .
it should accordingly be considered if they were subservient to my authority .
" i did not go out in procession of my own free will .
the few servants i engaged , i engaged for the protection of my own life , in consequence of my fears of the revolted and rebellious troops .
when these troops prepared to abscond , finding an opportunity , i got away secretly under the palace windows , and went and stayed in humayun ' s mausoleum .
from this place i was summoned with a guarantee that my life would be spared , and i at once placed myself under the protection of the government .
the mutinous troops wished to take me with them , but i would not go . "
the . entire defence shows how weak and spineless bahadur shah had become at the time when he was brought to trial .
he had no strength left in him and there was no trace of the famous mughal pride .
it appears that he was solely interested in saving his own life and that of his queen ( who by that time hated him ) .
he was neither in a position nor was he advised to cross - examine any of the witnesses .
the entire evidence against him remained unquestioned and it was on the basis of the untested evidence that the judge advocate general secured the conviction .
the deputy judge advocate general , major f . j . harriot , prosecutor for the government , then addressed the court .
they inspire and instigate each other to write and both turn out to be budding writers .
the inevitable complications arise and the happy nest is broken .
subedar bakht khan was appointed both lord governor general and commander - in - chief on 11th july , 1857 .
whatever was done under the authority of these two persons were in law to have been done under the authority of the king . "
an order of the king dated 6th september , 1857 , among other documents , was read .
who else could have given such an order . "
some papers described as ' court - diary ' were relied upon to prove that 49 europeans were murdered with the consent of the king .
forty - nine britishers were prisoners and the army demanded that they should be given over to them for slaughter .
the king delivered them by saying , ' the army may do as they please ' , and the prisoners were consequently put to the sword .
he also relied upon certain circulars purported to have been sent to the ruler of kutch , chief of jaisalmer and the ruler of jammu . "
from that moment there is no further disguise and no attempt at concealment .
after the speech of the deputy judge advocate general , the court adjourned to consider and arrive at its findings .
bahadur shah has been criticised by many writers for accepting the trial .
he was not a british subject , therefore there was no justification for the british government to try him before the tribunal .
the problem analysed in chokher bali , which is a fuller and a better constructed novel , is posed in a more complex setting .
the lover will become a teacher and the poet will don the robes of a prophet .
life in calcutta with its incessant clamour and distractions was too noisy and distasteful .
he needed proximity to nature and earth , he needed quiet for his work and he needed activity to fill the leisure between writing .
what better place than santiniketan to suit all his requirements ?
" it therefore only remains for us to consider what punishment we ought to inflict upon you .
an english judge was sacrosanct : above law , above criticism .
ramcoomar dey was discharged without any punishment .
justice mitter , who had the rare courage to dissent , did not agree with the majority opinion and the sentence awarded .
he opposed such severe punishment in a case of this nature .
it was well known that surendra nath banerjea was not only a great orator and politician , but a man of great learning and master of english language .
he was fully advised by his counsel and there was nothing vague in his affidavit .
still the chief justice observed , to justify the punishment :
the complexion of guilt in the case of mr taylor is certainly not of a lighter character than that of surendra nath banerjea .
he would combine the ancient spirit with the modern setting and recast the old in a new mould .
he named it brahmacharya asrama , after the ancient forest hermitages .
but that was always tagore ' s wayto interpret tradition in his own fashion , to honour the dead on his own terms .
their sentences were accordingly reduced from death to transportation for life .
their lordships delivered separate judgments .
they agreed in acquitting b . h . kane .
the commital proceedings before the magistrate , mr birley , occupied 76 days .
the trial in the court of sessions lasted 131 days .
the appeal in the high court was heard for 47 days .
the two judges disagreed and the reference by a third judge was heard for 20 days .
the prosecution consequently lost its evidence at sessions .
banerjee , a police officer , was shot before he could be called as a witness and his murderer was never discovered .
mr norton was allowed to keep a loaded pistol in his brief throughout the trial . 4 .
this was followed by transportation of madanlal dhingra of savarkar ' s group , for killing curzon wyllie with a bomb in london ,
meanwhile , revolutionaries in india became very active .
in 1910 , kanhere shot the collector of nasik to avenge the transportation of his brother .
brought back to india , he was tried by a special tribunal on charges of treason .
there were strong security arrangements on the ship .
" s . s . morea " developed some engine trouble and was forced to anchor at marseilles on the evening of 7th july , 1910 .
the task was not only dangerous but perilous and savarkar used his uncanny intelligence and ingenuity .
he opened fire on the escaping prisoner .
it was unfortunate that savarkar ' s colleagues , who were planning his rescue , were late by a few hours .
the news of savarkar ' s daring but unsuccessful attempt to escape on 8th july , 1910 shook the conscience of the world .
handcuffed and guarded , savarkar braved the circumstances , to reach india , with undaunted spirit .
he the " s . s . sasti " reached bombay without any mishap .
on 22nd july , 1910 , the prince of indian revolutionaries , savarkar , was received at the bombay harbour in a befitting manner .
a closed motor van transferred him to a well guarded special train which delivered him to the nasik police custody .
she grumbled only when he came in the way of her dressing her children in fine clothes .
nor did she remain unlettered for long .
she soon acquired proficiency not only in her own language but in english and sanskrit as well .
at her husband ' s persuasion she translated into bengali an abridged version of the ramayana from the original sanskrit .
she also acted on the stage in his play raja o rani and gave an excellent interpretation of the role sho was assigned .
the fact that he was brought to india on an illegal warrant was not a point of consideration for them .
the special tribunal passed judgment on a man whose case was subjudice in the international court of arbitration at the hague .
in a country ruled by imperialism , justice also assumes an imperious face and imperils truth .
it is significant to note that not content with the order of transportation for savarkar , the indian government of lord sydenham instituted a second case against him .
this time charging him with abetment of the murder of mr jackson , the collector of nasik .
the very same special tribunal was asked to try him .
the show was again enacted .
this was the first trial of its kind where legality and morality of the indian non - co - operation movement was involved .
the hon ' ble chief justice , j . m . shelat , of the gujarat high court , described the trial thus :
articles date of issue in which it appeared 1 .
disaffection - a virtue 15th june , 1921 2 .
tampering with loyalty 29th september , 1921 3 .
a puzzle and its solution 15th december , 1921 4 .
" my name is mohandas .
my father ' s name is karamchand gandhi .
my age is about 53 years .
i am by caste hindu banya .
my occupation is farmer and weaver .
" q . the evidence has been given in your hearing .
do you wish to make any remarks about it ?
" and i hereby direct that you be tried by the said court on the said charge .
the case was committed to the court of sessions , ahmedabad on the plea of ' guilty ' under section 124 - a of the indian penal code .
gandhiji and banker were then removed to sabarmati the trial aroused wide interest and attracted spectators from all over india .
the trial began at 12 o ' clock before r . s . broomfield esquire , i . c . s . , sessions judge .
at five minutes to twelve , the accused were brought in custody in the court .
in the same number was another article , dated 28th july , 1921 , in which it was stated that ' we have to destroy the system ' .
they were earlier in date than the article ' tampering with loyalty ' , and it was referred to by the government of bombay .
there were murders and destruction of property , inflicting misery and misfortune on many people .
the most unhappy man present there was , perhaps , the judge himself .
he restrained his emotions , cleared his voice , gathered his strength and delivered his oral judgment in careful and dignified words .
few readers would normally suspect that tagore ' s poems on children so full of innocent delight were written during a period of great dejection and anxiety .
for their sake he had to hide his own grief and anxiety and to share their little interests and listen to their prattle .
on the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children . "
in september 1903 , nine months after her mother ' s death , renuka died , at the age of thirteen .
this precocious , moody and uncommon girl was very dear to the father who felt her loss deeply , though he gave no expression to his grief .
he buried himself in his work and continued to fill the pages of his literary journal , bangadarshan .
on 20th march , 1929 large - scale arrests were carried out simultaneously in half a dozen different towns .
the news of the arrest created a stir in the country .
dr dharamvir singh , stated that he had never been a communist and as a follower of gandhi was opposed to communist objectives and methods .
s . h . jhabwalla argued that he was a tarsi humanitarian ' , while alve claimed himself to be an ' agriculturist and a labourer ' .
the first phase of the meerut conspiracy case , the magistrate enquiry , ended on 15th december , 1929 after lasting for about seven months .
on 13th january , 1930 , thirty - one out of the thirty - two accused were committed to trial by mr milner white .
all the prisoners except dr dharamvir singh were committed to be tried by the court of special sessions , merrut .
m . n . roy , who was not arrested at that time , was tried separately .
the first application in this respect was made to the chief justice in allahabad on 16th july , 1929 .
the final application for transfer was moved on 24th january , 1930 by sir tej bahadur sapru .
on 27th january , 1930 the chief justice dismissed the application and ordered the case to proceed in the meerut sessions court .
in doing so he observed that a jury might not take a judicial view .
consequently , " he concluded , " the only man who could give a fair and just decision on a matter of this kind was a single judge . "
the prosecution rested its case on 17th march , 1931 after examining 281 witnesses and producing 2,600 documents .
this was followed by the rendering of the formal statements of the prisoners and the presentation of the official defence of the accused .
conclusion the meerut trial was from the very beginning a political case .
as the trial proceeded , it assumed a propagandist character on both sides .
the defendants in their turn seized the opportunity to make political speeches and propaganda statements from the court .
to this end each of the accused delivered an individual statement of defence followed by joint statement .
a mammoth procession led by lala lajpat rai greeted it with black flags and was lathi - charged by the police .
bhagat singh , rajguru and azad decided to kill mr scott as he was suspected to be responsible for ' the lathi ' blows on lajpat rai .
taking him for scott , they shot dead assistant superintendent of police , mr j . p . saunders , on 17th december , 1928 .
innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved , was something amazing . "
both dauntless heroes stood like a rock at their places to court arrest .
after raising revolutionary slogans and throwing leaflets in the central hall , both the accused courted arrest at the hands of the police .
both were kept in solitary confinement and under strict security .
the british government not wanting to take any chance , sent the summons to the accused in jail .
on the day of hearing elaborate security arrangements were made .
the newspaper , the hindustan times , reported :
" police constables with lathis were lined from the magistrate ' s residence on the rajpur road to the jail and all other roads leading to the jail .
c . i . d . men in plain clothes were seen cycling on the roads as well as watching all important crossings .
i find that by doing so , he did cause hurt to sir george sanchuster , mr r . p . rao and mr shankar rao .
these facts constitute an offence punishable under section 308 of i . p . c . with transportation for life or with lesser punishment .
" 1 find both the accused guilty of both the offences with which they are charged and convict them accordingly . "
" the acts of each accused constitute offences punishable under two different provisions of law .
that decision was , thus , communicated to the central government by the government of punjab through a telegram :
" bhagat singh , rajguru and sukhdev will be executed at 7 on the evening of march , 23rd .
the news will be made known in lahore on the early morning of march , 24 . "
they were duly hanged by neck in the dark of the night and an announcement was made :
this happened when the labour government was in power in great britain .
the daily worker of new york commented :
this is one of the bloodiest deeds ever undertaken by the british labour government , under the leadership of r . macdonald .
in the year 1915 , he left india and visited indonesia , malaysia , china , japan and the usa before reaching berlin in 1916 .
he was in the usa from 1916 to 1917 .
he became a member of the mexican socialist party - the first communist party outside russia .
he went to spain , berlin and moscow and met lenin in 1920 .
he was an active member of the second congress of communist international conference and was a member of the marxist bureau .
he was an intellectual , a prolific writer and wrote several books on marxism , revolution , renaissance , science , history , etc . from 1927 onwards .
in 1930 he returned to india and was arrested in 1931 .
he was sentenced to 12 years ' imprisonment in 1932 which was later reduced to 6 years by the appeal court .
he spent 5 years in british jails .
kanpur had been selected originally as venue of the trial to avoid jury trial and demonstrations .
he was first produced before the magistrate who committed him to stand trial before the sessions .
the charges framed were as follows :
organisation , known as the communist international ; that a section of the said organisation , acting
he said , " the immediate and potential dangers of the communist movement in india even as an isolated factor are sufficiently obvious .
between these two groups , roy ' s communists occupy a dangerously convenient yet tactical position . "
roy could not be arrested at that time but he was in constant touch .
m . n . roy was very disappointed and in a letter to a friend in india , in november 1924 , wrote :
" poor fellows , if they could only have put up a better defence , four years in jail would have been worthwhile . "
the learned judge of the high court discussed the evidence upon which the conviction was based and which was almost entirely documentary .
the evidence consisted of :
a ) letters form m . n . roy and his associates in india and letters from them to him .
the judge said :
" various technical legal objections were taken by the learned counsel , dr k . n . katju , in the appeal .
the learned judge , after fully considering the submissions , held :
i joined it because i wanted freedom for my motherland and was - ready to shed my blood for it .
i claim that in doing so i committed no offence . on the other hand , i have served my country to the best of my ability . "
lt . g . s . dhillon too challenged the authority of the court to try him .
i am further advised that in point of law my trial by court martial is illegal . "
bhulabhai desai brilliantly analysed the evidence led by the prosecution regarding each case of alleged murder and torture .
it was by this government that war was declared and the indian national army fought the war .
the trial was conducted when opinion in india was very much against it .
the trial did much good in further arousing national consciousness among indians but did a lot of harm to the cause of the british empire .
an explosive situation was saved by the commander - in - chief when he commuted the sentence of the three officers .
had the sentence passed by the court been carried out against strong public opinion , it would have created chaos in the country at that time .
we declare to the world that this sale deed confers no privileges equivalent to those claimed by states governed by treaty rights .
the people of kashmir are determined to mould their own destiny and we appeal to mission to recognise justice and strength of our cause . "
like mahatma gandhi , he too gave a call for ' quit kashmir ' .
he made several such speeches during may , 1946 in this connection which alarmed maharaja hari singh .
the people of kashmir soon rose in support of the sheikh in his move against misrule and exploitation of the people by the maharaja and his prime minister .
in a letter dated 18th june , 1946 maharaja hari singh wrote thus to ' a senior british official in delhi :
now every person is entitled to freedom .
" this deed of sale has ruined our people .
you should say ' quit kashmir ' .
revoke the deed of sale .
we wish to tell the british that maharaja hari singh has no right to rule over this country .
one wholesaler purchased and passed us on to retailers . ( 10th may , 1946 ) .
after a hundred years of misrule , we say that we have never accepted nor will accept this rule .
for this right , we will have to make supreme sacrifice .
after a hundred years , we will not remain slaves of the dogra shahi even for one day .
" make preparation , you are the harbinger of the voice thereby breaking the shackles of slavery .
( fitzgerald j . in ( 1868 ) 11 cox . c . c . 54 at page 55 ) .
asaf ali said that to raise voice against oppression and demand the fundamental right to live did not amount to sedition .
one is not even a graduate , though the other is .
whatever may be their capacity for reporting , it is impossible for them to reproduce the effect of the original .
and he was quite correct in saying that the people of the state were slaves of slaves .
there is nothing wrong or seditious about it .
asaf ali warned the court of the consequences that would follow if leaders like sheikh were convicted under such law .
" he further claimed that the right of conquest did not admit of the recognition of the wishes of the people of the conquered territory and so on .
however , the sheikh ' s profound statement and asaf ali ' s incisive speech made no impact on the court which , as predetermined , convicted sheikh abdullah .
a recent survey indicates that the number of two - wheelers in our country is expected to touch the 50 - million mark by a . d . 2000 .
automobiles are a still greater source of pollution in other parts of the world .
dust from quarries construction of dwelling houses and setting up of industries have increased manifold during the last two decades .
to cater to the demand for stones and cement to be used in these buildings , newer types of machineries are put into use .
effects on materials air pollutants like sulphur dioxide , smoke , grit and dust cause damage to property and materials .
sulphur dioxide is the most damaging of all gaseous pollutants .
it forms calcium sulphate , leading to a slow loss of limestone and unsightly blistering of the rain - washed areas .
global effects unlike other types of pollution , air pollution impinges on the climate too .
yes it is .
the ph is an index of hydrogen ion concentration of the liquid .
in this scale , a low ph means high concentration of the hydrogen ion and high acidity .
pure water has a ph of 7 , and this is neutral ph .
water with a ph less than 7 tends to be acidic while water of ph above 7 is alkaline .
the ph range of acid rain - water is between 2 - 5 .
this low ph means high acidity , and subsequently , high corrosivity .
thus water with ph 4 is more corrosive ( 10 times ) than water with ph 5 .
water of ph 3 is still more corrosive ( 100 times ) than water having a ph 5 .
if this is the case then one can imagine the corrosive nature of acid rain with a ph ranging between . 2 and 3 .
in fact , swedish school children launched a postcard campaign against west germany in protest against such emissions .
dispute over acid rain has led to strained relations between the usa and canada .
nearly half of the sulphur deposits in canada come from the usa and about 20 per cent of the deposits in north - east usa originate in canada .
the direct relation of acid rain to human health has not yet been thoroughly established .
the main constituent of acid wastes is sulphuric acid .
in addition , nitric acid , hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid are also present .
these acids cause damage to metals or concrete structures , pumps , etc . due to their corrosive action .
moreover , hydrogen sulphide gas is produced when the acids come into contact with the sludge and the mud of the rivers .
acidic pollutants also destroy micro - organisms inhibiting ( previous ) ( next ) the self - purification process of the rivers .
fish and other aquatic animals are adversely affected with the sudden change in the ph .
acids are reported to be lethal to fish and other forms of aquatic life .
alkalis : presence of alkalis alters the ph value in rivers resulting in the break off of the natural buffer system .
like acids , alkalis too destroy bacterial and other micro - organisms so as to restrict the self - purification of the stream .
the breath of spring blows through every line of it , it throbs with the ecstasy of sensuous delight .
indeed , the theme is the enchantment of spring and the power of its spell on the senses .
spring is itself one of the characters in this play , which is one of rabindranath ' s most beautiful plays .
almost flawless as a work of art , and in a class by itself .
written in blank verse , it was his last great experiment in that form .
it was found that the stream was polluted with lead compounds which led to lead poisoning .
the hexavalent form is reported to be toxic for human beings and aquatic life .
copper sulphate and copper compounds are being used extensively in treatment of reservoir water to control the growth of algae and diatoms .
copper is extremely poisonous and its effects need no explanation .
the metals described above are toxic to fish and other aquatic life .
heavy metal ions precipitate the mucous secretions of their gills .
these precipitates occupy the interlamellar space obstructing the movement of gill filaments and respiration .
thousands of acres of fertile land have acquired salinity and become unfit for agriculture .
the ground - water table over many square kilometres has been so seriously affected that water from the wells in these areas has turned bitter .
the percentage of dissolved solids is also high , rendering the water unfit for drinking .
the reason for such deterioration in quality is attributed to the industrial discharges in these areas .
lung and skin diseases are prevalent among the villagers , and all due to polluted ground - water .
excess withdrawal of ground - water through heavy duty pumps has resulted in the flooding of sea - water through the cavities .
for instance , in our country distilleries are engaged in setting up bio - gas plants which are fed by their effluents .
this results in a substantial reduction in fuel costs and decrease in the strength of the effluent .
conversion of sludge into useful products : the sludge obtained on treatment of effluents is also a problem .
the sludge from pulp and paper industry may be used for the manufacture of boards used in packing or in preparation of artificial wooden panels .
the sludge from the electroplating industry may be used in the formulation of water - proofing compounds .
wastes from nuclear power plants do not give off offensive odour nor do they release any obnoxious gases .
the cause of the problem is that nuclear waste becomes harmless only after millions of years .
the plutonium produced during power generation ( 200 kg per year per reactor ) is sufficient to cause cancer in every human being .
constant exposure to radiation causes genetic defects and can affect the generations to come .
radio - tracers are extensively used in the fields of medicine , industry , agriculture and biology to determine the course of chemical and biochemical reactions .
substances administered to patients and used in radiation therapy are now proving important sources of nuclear harm .
it can cause mental anguish too . .
our community functions and ceremonies like marriages , festivals , etc . are noisy events .
if he goes to the cinema for relaxation , there too the noise levels are too high . "
effects of noise pollution a survey was conducted in various towns and cities of india to check the sound levels .
it revealed that noise during daytime in delhi , bombay , calcutta and madras ranges between 60 - 90 db ( decibels ) .
acute damage occurs to the eardrum when exposed to very loud and sudden noises .
a more serious consequence of noise pollution is the chronic damage to the hair cells in the - inner ear .
prolonged exposure to noise of certain frequency pattern leads to temporary or permanent hearing loss .
acoustic zones should be created to prevent propagation of noise through air or solids .
trees may be planted in and around the factory to attenuate noise .
the sides of the roads or highways could be lined with trees , which act as a buffer and reduce the noise level .
noise at community level can be curbed by imposing a ban on blaring loudspeakers and by reducing their pitch .
this is particularly necessary near hospitals and schools .
it has been proved that constant loud noise can impair hearing ability and cause problems connected with nervous disorders .
in october 1912 , rabindranath sailed for the united states , accompanied by his son and daughter - in - law .
some perhaps will refuse to fall under the spell of this indian poet because this philosophy is not theirs .
a recent survey indicates that much of the himalayas , the western ghats , and the shivalik ranges are now devoid of forest cover .
a satellite imagery reveals that the forest cover is being lost at the rate of 130 million sq m a year .
the rate of depletion in haryana is no less .
most mountains in the himalayas have been denuded and womenfolk have to walk daily for several kilometres to collect fuel .
people feel that forests are their open treasure - houses for them to use as they feel like .
secondly , the greed of our forest contractors is compounding the problem .
while pollution cannot be curbed completely , the levels of pollution can be minimised by adopting remedies that are simple and low cost .
for example , deforestation must be followed by afforestation .
one tree should be planted for each tree axed .
the visakhapatnam steel plant in andhra pradesh has planted over two million trees in its complex .
they have also coined a slogan : ' a tree for each tonne of liquid steel produced . '
reuse of waste water plays a crucial role in abating pollution .
we are very restless in thought , but we have none that poets can express . "
indeed , critics were not wanting who refused " to fall under the spell of this indian poet . "
the reaction among tagore ' s own countrymen was no less mixed .
one of them " shouted in true american fashion , dn it . "
others cited many other bengali poets , among them nabin sen and d . l . roy , as much greater than tagore .
at any rate tagore ' s name was now sufficiently bandied about in the english papers for his reputation to have crossed the atlantic .
perhaps the first journal in the west to publish his poems .
this was followed by an invitation from the chicago universityfor a lecture .
naively tagore inquired , " are the asiatics eligible for the prize ? "
they cannot understand why this distinction was bestowed upon one who is not white . "
in january 1913 rabindranath came to chicago where he lectured on the " ideals of the ancient civilisation of india " and on " the problem of evil " .
after visiting new york tagore returned to london in april 1913 where also he delivered a course of lectures at the caxton hall .
when he had arrived in london less than a year earlier , he was an unknown stranger .
now he had become a sensation and a curiosity .
there is no end to human cleverness .
the next morning she laid aside her man ' s garment and decked in feminine finery sought arjuna out in the forest and tried to woo him .
but arjuna repulsed her advances and said that he was under an oath of celibacy and could not touch a woman .
humiliated and wounded in the core of her being , chitra broke her bow into two and invoked by her penance madana , the god of love .
give me but one day of perfect beauty , and i will answer for the days that follow . "
while she was washing her limbs and playing with water on the edge of a forest pool , arjuna saw her and was swept off his feet .
forgetting his vow of celibacy he wooed her .
for some months the lovers lived in the bliss of love ' s abandon .
their idealism was not with out a hard core of realism and a sense of humour .
a typical example of recurrent symbolism in indian tradition .
gandhi ' s reformist zeal did not spare the poet ' s personal diet either .
rabindranath smiled and said softly , " it must be a very slow poison , for i ' ve been eating it for about half a century now . "
gandhi and tagore the saint who strove to make politics holy and the poet who made holiness seem beautiful .
however firm and unfaltering the feet , they could not keep pace with the wings .
jagmohan ' s god - denying humanism is contrasted in the first chapter with his brother ' s god - believing meanness and cupidity .
sachish , revolted by his father ' s sickening orthodoxy , is a follower of his uncle ' s way of life .
he comes across a young girl , an orphan , who had been seduced by his own elder brother and thrown on the streets .
to safeguard her future sachish offers to marry her .
this incident comes as a shock to sachrsh ' s cultivated belief in human rationalism .
he catches the dread disease and dies .
" he deserved it , " comments his orthodox brother .
damini loves sachish but cares little for the guru the facade of whose piety does not deceive her .
just then he feels a touch on his feet .
unable to escape from thoughts of damini , sachish finally begs her to release him from her spell by voluntarily renouncing her desire for him .
the atmosphere of the novel is tense , reflecting the tensions of the period it depicts .
it was a stormy period of national upsurge , of an upheaval of violent passions long submerged , of a clash of ideals and interests .
the sombre narrative scintillates with brilliant sparks of thought as the flints of opposing arguments strike against one another .
the plot , like all tagore ' s plots , is very simplethe usual , age - old triangle , two men and a woman .
nevertheless , the character , as it emerges in the novel , is more shadowy than real .
a significant title in more senses than the one employed for the novel .
tagore himself was tossing between his love of his home and the hire of the world .
he was restless once again .
" i have the call of the open road , though most of the roads are closed , " he wrote to andrews in june 1915 .
" i am in a nomadic mood , but it is becoming painful to me for want of freedom .
they are by no means literature of any high . quality , though many of them are interesting in themselves .
some of them are quoted below as specimens : " i cannot choose the best .
the best chooses me . "
" every child comes with the message that god is not yet discouraged of man . "
" he who is busy doing good finds no time to be good . "
he admired the japanese for being modern but reminded them that " true modernism is freedom of mind , not slavery of taste .
leonard elmhirst has related that tagore himself some time later gave him a gist of his conversation with the mahatma on that memorable day .
" non - cooperation clashed with his way of thinking , for his mentality , his rich intelligence , had been nourished on all cultures of the world . "
what sacrifice are the students called upon to make ?
not sacrifice for more complete education but for no education .
when he declined to do so , they went away in anger , doubting his patriotism .
and the only criticism one can make of them is that they plane too high .
here i feel every day what a terrible nightmare it is for the human soul to bear this burden of the monster of arithmetic .
it incessantly drivers its victims and yet leads them nowhere .
" i sleep and awake , sleep again and wake .
" were you not my mother , but some one else ' s , d ' you think i would n ' t know you , mother ?
would n ' t i still hide in your lap ?
what fun it would be to have two homes , one for the day and one at night !
where i came from , that ' s where i want to go .
but where it is , i keep on guessing .
then it seems to me that it must be everywhere .
" monday , tuesday , wednesday , they comeso soon , they must have airplanes at home .
but why does sunday come so late , mother ?
it seems to lag behind all others .
does he live farthest of all , as far away as the sky is , and is he the child of poor parents as you were , mother ? "
but the respite was brief and intermittent santiniketan clamoured for his attention .
pearson returned to the asrama on 26 september , after an absence of five years .
with him came leonard elmhirst , the young englishman whom tagore had met in new york .
who can say what might have been , if this or that had or had not happened ?
these are vain guesses : " with an ' if ' you might put paris in a bottle , " is a wise french saying . ,
even during his comparatively sterile periods he wrote enough and of such quality as to make many another writer famous .
it is true that at times the inspiration seemed to wane , the vitality to flag , and he drew less from life than from habit .
his simple and homely address is instinct with deep respect for the mahatma ' s personality .
returning to santiniketan in april , he left soon after for shillong to spend the summer in that lovely hill station of assam .
this play , like the earlier one , muktadhara , . shows tagore ' s increasing concern with the basic problems of modern civilisation .
the ageing ' poet was reliving in imagination his romantic youth .
his younger contemporaries , charmed by his latest novel , begged him to make an anthology of his love poems and add a few new ones .
the suggestion was enough to stimulate a mind that needed no more than a prod .
not quite artificial , for the poet was always in love with love , an impersonal love .
on i march 1929 tagore sailed for canada at the invitation of the national council of education of that country .
he therefore cancelled his engagements in the states and sailed for japan .
this was not the first occasion when an accident intervened to mar his appreciation of the united states .
on a previous visit too he had been rubbed the wrong way .
he spent nearly a month in japan .
" how like our prophet ! " whispered the audience as they saw the indian poet .
inscribing the book to tagore , will durant had written , " you alone are sufficient reason why india should be free . "
it had been a long and tiring tour but rich and fruitful in experience .
he did not know then that this was his last visit to the west , that his sun in the western sky had set .
soon after his return to india in november 1890 the poems of manasi were published .
he is still haunted by his experience of the borderland , though the enchantment of life was beginning to regain its hold on him .
a few lines are quoted below in the poet ' s own english rendering ; my birthday !
there he wrote , besides some poems , a treatise on bengali language , later published as bangla bhasha parichaya ( an introduction to bengali language ) .
this was followed by another published in early 1941 , arogya ( convalescence ) .
in the evening the fever would return and he felt too weak and worn - out for any exertion .
the very first poem of the new volume is a reaffirmation of his old faith .
they too will pass and " leave not a sign behind . "
in their wishful thinking , the best homage they can pay tagore is to make him out to be a poet of the proletariat .
he had loved and felt for the common man all his life , long before it became a fashion to do so .
this concern was humane , a normal expression of a healthy moral sensibility , and not derived from any ideology .
nor is there anything particularly original or revolutionary in the statement that while empires fall , the common man continues to maintain life on earth .
it is the way it is said that makes the poem so memorable .
some poems were written on his last birthday at mungpoo , to which a reference was made earlier .
one of the finest among them was dictated at santiniketan on 21 january 1941 .
or did he anticipate it and hence the warning ?
those who sing passionately of the dispossessed seem to have little sympathy for anything else .
this is testified by a pallava inscription of the seventh centrury ad in one of the early cave - temples at mahabalipuram .
then again , buddhist tantric rituals percolated into the hindu modes of worship .
with such a background the growth of temples and organized temple worship became truly phenomenal .
the temple complexes have a single main shrine or sometimes more than one main shrine .
the single shrines are oblong , square or apsidal in plan .
its longer axis north - south was preceded by a closed maha - mandapa with six rows of five pillars each .
the porch framing the entrance shows similar imitation of timberwork in stone , including the torana arch above the lintel .
the tulaja cave in junnar is also an excavation after the model of a circular chaitya .
the doorway in front is a huge threshold with an arched window on top .
in front of the facade of the hall , a transverse verandah with frontal pillars is often cut .
with the commencement of the seventh century , and in the wake of the revivalist movements of the hindus , great changes were wrought and the bhakti cult developed .
the kannada area continued to be the centre of south indian jainism from where the various guchchhas branched out into the tamil and telugu areas .
the depiction is quite powerful and realistic .
the krishna - nappinnai theme is special to the earlier and contemporary tamil literature and tradition .
they continued the activity for over three centuries till they , like the pallavas , were overthrown by the rising cholas of thanjavur .
these are found at tiruvellarai , narttamalai , kunnandarkovil , puvalaikkudi and other places , all in the puduk - kottai and tiruchirapalli districts .
their cave - temples too are a type of mandapas with simples shrine - cells and are much akin to the pandya cave - temple in the same area .
they are dedicated to vishnu and are noted for their fine sculptured panels .
there are , however , some examples with pillars of other types and corbels with a curved profile and taranga moulding .
some of the excavations are merely shrine - cells scooped directly into rock face , without a rock - cut mandapa in front .
such cave - temples are numerous in this region and very rare in tondaimandalam .
one of these contains a bas - relief of gajalakshmi , and the other a group comprising devi as bhuvanesvari and her attendants .
the cave - shrine called paliyilisvaram at narttamalai , another muttaraiyar excavation , dates a few years before the seventh year of pallava nripatunga in the late ninth century .
the same may be said of the puvalaikkudi cave - shrine , which was excavated by a certain amarunri muttaraiyar .
the connected political history of the cheras of the second period after the earlier sangam epoch starts from the middle of the ninth century .
they belong to the first half of the eighth century and contain some fine sculptures .
the most characteristic feature of the style is the door - frame of the cella with elaborate over - door components .
the basal part of the inner sakhas and the jamb carry panels with reliefs of the river goddesses , ganga and yamuna .
in the chalukyan cave - temples of the southern zone , the kannada area , dvarapala forms along with the river goddesses are depicted in the same panels .
this is in addition to the relatively larger dvarapalas in the niches flanking the outermost entrance of the front mandapa , or front porch of the cave - temple .
in jogeshvari they flank the sanctum entrance , as also the outer mandapa entrance .
the dhumarlena , or cave 29 , is of greatest interest since it is the largest and most imposing of the caves at ellora .
the four doorways of the shrine are flanked by large dvarapalas and other accompanying sculptures .
additionally flanking the main hall are two lateral entrances through two portals or pillared transepts .
the pillars are huge in size with kumbhas or cushion capitals , and the statutory inside is also ponderous and of large proportions .
the cave - temple can be dated to the middle of the seventh century in the chalukyan period .
cave 27 , or the milkmaid ' s cave ( gopilena ) , is an interesting example with triple shrines on the rear and side walls of the mandapa .
the upper floor has the navaranga hall with twelve outer pillars as in the indra sabha , but there is also a shrine at the rear .
inside there is a large rock - cut linga pedestal , with its spout on the north , and with an inserted linga .
this is apparently a late plan after the model of caves 17 and 21 of ellora , and datable to the first quarter of the eighth century .
it was perhaps a provincial contemporary of dhumarlena of ellora .
there is an unfinished excavation by the side of the siva cave .
each cell has a door - opening .
the mandapa has two bays , at the front and the rear , forming mukha - and ardha - mandapas .
it is not clear if this cave is of western or eastern chalukyan authorship ; it could even have been of mixed tradition .
the nature of the sculpture and other evidence indicate an eastern chalukyan authorship in the mid - seventh century ad .
the doorways of the shrines are simple like those in the southern cave - temples and unlike the western chalukyan - rashtrakuta types with elaborate over - doors .
while most of the cave - temples are dedicated to siva , two are definitely dedicated to durga , and a few to vishnu .
the sculptural content is very meagre compared to the examples at badami , aihole , ellora , etc .
among the few sculptures , mention may be made of tandava siva .
the eight larger cave - temples fall into two groups .
an early , if imperfect , monolithic shrine form is found in the tawa cave at udaigiri ( vidisha district , madhya pradesh ) .
they thus form the most important landmarks in the study of indian temple architecture , especially of the south .
both the rathas lack sculptures on their aditala walls and are incomplete .
the griva and sikhara are , however , octagonal in section , making them both ashtanga , nirandhara vimanas of the dravida order of the composite variety .
there are four nasikas projected from the four cardinal sides of the griva sikhara .
the ardha - mandapa in both the vimanas carries haras of kutas and salas of a smaller size than those over the aditala .
the great kailasanatha temple in kanchi and others in the same place are of this kind .
the shore temple at mahabalipuram is a complex of three shrines with accessory mandapas , prakara enclosures and gopura entrances .
these names inscribed on the structure are all titles of rajasimha , the builder of the complex .
the larger eastern vimana has an additional prakara of its own , closely investing it on the east , south and north , and leaving the west open .
both its tolas are devoid of the hara .
the prakara has another entrance on the west at the middle , which is a real gopura entrance with a sola superstructure ; it is smaller in magnitude .
the mahendravarmesvara has a smaller enclosure with a small gopura or dvarasala in front and two lateral entrances in addition near the two front corners .
thus it was a village moot hall , a santhagara , even as the ladkhan in aihole was .
it originally , like the ladkhan , had a small shrine at the rear , now replaced by a much later one called vaikuntha - perumal .
the meguti of jain dedication with an inscription dated ad 634 is better evolved .
the walled central bay forms the main sanctum and also carries the roof shrine over it .
the three mukha - mandapa bays in front as also the corresponding three at the rear have slopy roofs .
the extreme recesses on the north and south of each lateral face of the mandapa wall have perforated windows .
the second tala is tall , rising as an upward extension of the aditala inner wall .
the third tala of a lesser height over it is also devoid of the hara elements .
among these , the temples at biccavolu ( east godavari district ) are characteristic .
the biccavolu series falls into two groups .
the kudus in the flexed cornice , or kapota , are horseshoe - shaped as in the pallava and early chalukyan examples .
though it is lesser in dimensions , it is more ornate with bold and round sculpture in the niches and cameos of puranic scenes formed by miniature panels .
they are all sculptures of a fine quality and most of them are now removed and exhibited in the thanjavur art gallery .
outside this gopura is the ornate but small nandi - mandapa .
beyond is another outer gopura that fronted a now non - existent outer prakara .
the advent of the special nataraja shrine as part of the sabha - mandapas or nritta - mandapas in siva temples has already been mentioned earlier .
they adopted different soft stones , such as the chloritic schist , for their temples during the middle of their period .
in general appearance , but for the characteristic sukanasikas , they resemble the biccavolu temples of the eastern chalukyas .
it had originally a closed navaranga - mandapa in front , though an open mandapa was added later on .
the central bay of the navaranga included within the four central pillars is a square larger than the eight surrounding peripheral bays .
in addition , it has four supporting pillars at the four inner corners of the garbha - griha .
the pilasters on the walls are slender with capitals that have lost their robust shapes .
the proportionate sizes of their components are lost and the abacus , or phalaka , is small and thin .
the decorative pilaster is framed inside a torana over two shorter pilaster supports .
this patriot and lover of his people was the severest critic of the follies of his countrymen .
it is as though prospero ' s wand suddenly breaks and the wonderful panorama of life and this world seems insubstantial .
everything must melt away like a shadow . getting and not getting , they both end in sighs .
but the love of life is strong and the mystic consciousness not yet overwhelming .
the very peculiarities of their plan and elevation could not afford the starting point for the vijayanagar series .
for , the emphasis on the horizontal division resulting in the tiered nature of the superstructure was the sine qua non of the recognized southern vimana order .
in such a perspective of the subdual , almost to the extent of obliteration in effect of the horizontal division and stratification , neither could the hoysala genre satisfy .
this pattern is found followed in many other temples of this area and the western coastal strip on the other side of the ghats .
the circular srikoyil of vadakkunnathan , the most northerly of the row , has its sanctum cells divided by a transverse diagonal wall .
the western half enshrining siva has its own door - opening and flight of steps in front with a detatched namaskar mandapa in front .
the eastern half is dedicated to devi parvati with a door opening on the east .
the northern and southern faces have false doors , or ghanadvaras .
the inner wall rising up further actually carries this immense conical roof , or sikhara , with a single metal stupi on top .
if they did so , they may have been urged on to it by mirza mughal . "
all papers they thought fit , they caused to be prepared , and , bringing them to me , compelled me to affix my seal .
sometimes they brought the rough drafts of orders , and had fair copies of them made by my secretary .
at other times , they brought the original letters intended for despatch , and left copies of them in the office .
hence , several rough drafts in diversity of hands have been filed in the proceedings .
frequently they had the seal impressed on the outside of empty unaddressed envelopes .
there is no knowing what papers they sent in these or to whom they sent them . "
i prefer to quote from the evidence . "
" he was a sovereign , proclaimed as king and his jurisdiction was paramount in delhi . "
he submitted that this statement clearly and satisfactorily proved that the king ' s servants were the murderers and the king was a party to it .
without any hesitation we own the responsibility for publishing .
he became a hero overnight .
it sowed the seed of the right of freedom of expression and trial of the press to express free and frank comments in the interest of public good .
it challenged the jurisdiction of the court to try for its own contempt .
interestingly enough , surendra nath banerjea was later made president of the xlth session of the indian national congress .
in 1897 , he started the shivaji festival and tried to revive patriotic fervour amongst the indians .
tilak was prosecuted under section 124 - a and a lengthy trial took place .
tilak defended himself and prepared a masterly defence , which is a document of historical importance .
tilak was sentenced to six years ' transportation to mandalay in burma and a fine of rs 1000 .
the third trial of tilak took place in the year 1916 , on his release from the six years ' sentence of transportation .
in this trial also he was prosecuted for sedition but no jail sentence was imposed .
the second trial of tilak in 1908 is of historical importance as it acquired a place in the history of criminal jurisprudence .
tilak was arrested and made to stand before the presidency magistrate to face charges in the preliminary hearing at the esplanade court in bombay .
the counsel for tilak argued that there should be a single trial .
the government advocate pressed for separate trials and the magistrate had no choice of his own but to uphold the government ' s view and ordered separate trials . ^
tilak was committed to the high court where such trials used to take place at that time .
for accurate translation to be submitted to the court and to enable tilak to prepare his own defence , it was only just and fair to grant him bail .
he assured the judge that tilak could be relied upon to appear in court on the date fixed for the hearing .
mr jinnah also reminded the judge of the earlier decision of mr justice tyabji when bail in such a matter was granted .
mr justice davar refused to grant bail .
though tilak was not a revolutionary and nor did he believe in violent methods , elaborate security arrangements were made to guard him while he was under arrest .
the government moved its troops to control the unprecedented crowd who waited outside to have a glimpse of their beloved leader .
a dispute also arose about the nature of the jury .
the government wanted tilak to be tried by a special jury to secure his conviction .
the barrister , joseph baptista , brilliantly argued against the government ' s insistence on a special jury .
thus from the very start there would be this prejudice against tilak because of his alleged attack on their community in his paper .
he imbibes with his limbs and with his senses long before he learns with his brain .
he must therefore be provided with an environment which will stimulate and feed his curiosity and make his introduction to the world around him easy and joyful .
he should be encouraged to do things for himself and should lean as little as possible on his teacher .
the best teacher , according to tagore , is nature .
young savarkar , deeply impressed , took an oath to fight like the chaphekars for india ' s freedom .
next year it was expanded into the ' mitra mela ' .
in 1902 , vinayak joined the fergusson college , poona , and lived in its residency .
he gathered round him a band of young patriots .
in 1906 , on tilak ' s recommendation , vinayak secured shyam krishna verma ' s scholarship and sailed for england .
it involved important legal issues on international as well as national laws .
savarkar had purpose in life and it was to liberate his motherland from the foreign yoke by all means .
he was a brilliant student , but was not in a position to go abroad at his own .
savarkar reached london in 1906 and devoted himself to his studies .
the brigadier had seized savarkar by one arm for the purpose of taking him back to the ship and the prisoner went peace - " fully with him .
the brigadier did not release his hold till they reached the deck of the vessel .
it would appear that the incident did not occupy more than a few minutes .
these circumstances show that the persons on board in charge of savarkar might well have believed that they could count on the assistance of the french police .
in consequence of this , the commissaire was put in communication with the british police officer - in - charge of the prisoner .
the court held :
the judgment of the tribunal shocked the world as it made mockery of the established right of asylum as cited in international law .
oppenheim in international law ( vol . 1 , 8th edition , p . 703 has given a summary of the case france vs . great britain .
some members of the british parliament also criticised the judgment of the hague court .
a well - known journal , sociologist , published in europe by an indian patriot , shyam krishna verma , commented :
it was commented upon by dr oppenheim , authority on international law in the following words : " this judgment reduces the right of asylum to very narrow limits .
mohandas karatnchand gandhi was born at porbandar in gujarat on 2nd october , 1869 .
he was the youngest of three sons and had one sister .
his father , karamchand uttamchand , was prime minister of rajkot .
gandhi was in school till 1887 .
gandhi was married in 1881 to kasturbai .
after spending nine months in a college , he left for england in september , 1888 to study law .
he returned home in 1891 and set himself up as a lawyer .
in april 1893 , gandhi was called to natal in the service of a merchant named seth abdulla .
soon after arrival , he experienced in person the harsh treatment meted out to coloured people by the whites .
there he also read tolstoy ' s the kingdom of god is within " you ' , and was deeply impressed by the latter ' s writings .
this was shifted in june , 1917 to the banks of the sabarmati river opposite the city .
between 1917 and 1918 , gandhi participated in two movements in champaran ( bihar ) and kaira ( gujarat ) and in the labour dispute in ahmedabad itself .
gandhi reacted sharply against the oppressive measures and stood forth as the leader of the resurgent indian nationalism .
from 1924 to 1929 , gandhi devoted himself largely to the constructive programmes and undertook several ' satyagraha ' movements .
in 1924 he was elected president of the indian national congress .
detailed studies have been undertaken on his philosophy of life and on his political , social , religious and economic ideas .
gandhi has been looked upon by many primarily as a man of religion ; by others , as a leader of indian nationalism .
he was very regular and methodical in his habits , and austere in his style of living .
" a . i only want to state that when the proper time comes , i shall plead ' guilty ' so far as disaffection towards government is concerned .
accused no . 2 refused to call any defence witnesses and requested the court to take up the case soon .
the learned magistrate passed the following order under section 213 :
" i , l . n , brown , additional district magistrate hereby charge you , mohandas kamrachand gandhi as follows :
the leave - taking took nearly an hour .
the military officers were waiting with a car for gandhiji .
at about two o ' clock , gandhiji entered the car with kasturba , pandit malaviya , banker and mrs naidu .
the curtain fell finally but only after india ' s message of truth and nonviolence had been recorded on the sheets of history .
the preliminary enquiry commenced before mr milner white , special magistrate , at the district court of meerut .
in his opening address he emphasised the role of moscow and the third international in carrying on communist propaganda in india .
they made vigorous efforts to capture the trade union congress in 1927 and last year , they persistently adhered to the moscow clique .
the sentences were reduced considerably .
hutchinson and eight others were completely acquitted .
in the sessions court the prosecution evidence took over 13 months . 3 .
the arguments continued for over four - and - a - half months . 6 .
the hearing of arguments started on 24th july , 1933 . 8 .
the trial was a farce throwing all established legal norms and procedures to the winds .
on completion of his primary education at the village school in banga , bhagat singh was sent to the d . a . v . college at lahore .
from 1923 to the time of his execution in 1931 , bhagat singh worked for the liberation of his motherland .
in 1925 he founded the nav jazvan bharat sabha at lahore to inculcate a spirit of revolution among the youth .
he came in touch with other revolutionaries like sukhdev , yashpal , chandra shekhar azad , jatindra nath das and others , who were also working among the youth .
when the simon commission landed in bombay on 3rd february , 1928 , the congress gave a call of black flag demonstration against it .
lala lajpat rai suffered grave bodily injuries . he succumbed to his injuries and , barely a fortnight after the incident , died on 17th november , 1928 .
bhagat singh took upon himself to avenge this national insult with ' blood for blood .
bhagat singh and his comrades took their pre - planned positions in the office which was located in the punjab central secretariat .
after some time , an englishman came out of the office .
jai gopal , one of bhagat singh ' s comrades , mistook him for mr scott .
actually he was j . p . saunders , assistant superintendent of police .
" both bhagat singh and b . k . dutt looked cheerful and kept smiling all along .
contrary to the procedure in the court , they were seated handcuffed behind an iron railing on a bench .
behind them , sat the jail official and some c . i . d . men . "
eleven prosecution witnesses ( all belonging to the government ) were examined that day .
not a single independent witness was there .
when the court rose for lunch , bhagat singh ' s family was allowed to meet him in the presence of police officials .
but , now the request was turned down with the court pleading that it was not bound to follow any precedent .
the statement ended with the slogan , ' long live the revolution ' .
the hearing of the case ended on 10th june , 1929 and the judgment was announced on the 12th .
delivering the judgment , the sessions judge charged :
" the accused admit throwing bombs in the assembly chamber .
it started on 10th july , 1929 .
in this case , 27 persons were involved .
out of 27 , six were at large and could not be traced .
of the remaining 18 , three were discharged under various sections .
the remaining 15 , including phonindra nath ghosh and bhagat singh , were put on trial .
the first two were found unreliable and the prosecution case rested mainly on the evidence of the remaining five approvers .
all the accused who stood trial were young .
they knew what was going to happen and hence decided not to take the case seriously and adopted an attitude of total indifference .
various methods were devised by bhagat singh and his comrades to mock the court and its proceedings .
" second charge : indian army act , section 41 ( against the said lt . gurbaksh singh dhillon alone ) .
" fourth charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said lt . gurbaksh singh dhillon alone ) .
" fifth charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said captain p . k . sehgal alone ) .
" sixth charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said lt . gurbaksh singh dhillon alone ) .
where the king and the country coincide there is no question of an alternative .
when you are formally fighting to liberate the country , then the point is whether the question of allegiance can arise at all .
he continued that modern international law had recognised the right of subject races , not at the moment independent , to so organise as to fight for their liberation .
shri asaf ali , prominent advocate from delhi assisted by shri jia lal kilam and other advocates appeared in court to defend sheikh abdullah .
sheikh abdullah delivered all his speeches in the kashmiri language except for one which was in urdu .
" three parts of india are under the direct control of the british and one - fourth is indirectly under them .
in these parts , ten crore human beings live as slaves .
they do not want to fall prey to the life of luxury of rajas and maharajas .
forty lakh people are falling prey to the luxury of one man .
" i address those hindus who laud the dogra raj to tell them what this raj is , its foundation is built on shameful treachery .
today in 1946 , i will take revenge of this shameful treachery from the descendants of maharaja gulab singh .
no force , no conspiracy can keep these people in slavery .
" the decision for freedom from slavery has to be taken by us by our blood .
" revolt is the right of a slave .
" after three hundred years , we will put an end to this dogra raj .
this is a , sacred war .
exhort people to join this war .
those who waste the wealth of the people earned by their blood and sweat on dogs and horses kre worse than tyrants .
it is the duty of every man to break away from their trap . " 3 .
these slogans have no other significance and effect except that of hatred and contempt against the ruler and the family . 5 .
the prosecution examined 26 witnesses in support of the charge .
most of the witnesses were police and c . i . d . men and officers .
some of them were not well versed in their knowledge of english language who took down the speeches and translated the same into english .
it was clear from the beginning that the state and the court were anyhow bent upon convicting sheikh abdullah .
the speeches were torn out of context and the entire prosecution was based on notes of such speeches .
sheikh abdullah courageously admitted that he had made the inflammatory speeches and that he stood by what he said .
this has attracted the penal and preventive provisions of law .
where law is not based on will of the people , it can lend itself to the suppression of their aspirations .
such law has no moral validity even though it may be enforced for a while .
this is a travesty of fact and i deny and repudiate these allegations .
it stands also for social and economic changes to end privileges and to raise the masses . "
while concluding his submission before the sessions court , sheikh abdullah uttered these memorable words :
" it is a small matter whether i am imprisoned and tried and convicted .
then only shall we be worthy of the land we dwell in . "
the public prosecutor submitted that the charges had been proved and that the sheikh should be awarded the maximum punishment .
mr asaf ali , defence counsel , made a memorable speech in defence .
it is also a historic trial in this sense .
sir , in it are involved deep fundamental issues .
it seemed to them to turn upon an issue which goes to the very root of the constitution of the state .
in it is involved the great issue of the fundamental rights of the people , not only of this state but also of all the indian states . "
asaf ali then attacked the prosecution witness and evidence :
" the prosecution here challenges this right of the people to raise their voice in assertion of their fundamental rights .
the entire essence of the speeches delivered by the accused from the 6th to the 16th is none else but this .
what is it that he is demanding ?
he is demanding a responsible and representative government , a government which is conducted by the people for the people .
is this an unreasonable demand ?
it is the voice of human conscience .
it is the voice of the people .
sheikh abdullah is only a symbol of the people ' s undeniable aspirations and rights .
what he is saying now will be repeated time and again and it will go down in history .
on relying upon the torn out - of - context sentences from the speeches by the prosecution , he said :
i shall only refer to the appropriate and relevant portion of this judgment .
" it is also to be remembered that mere abusive epithets , declamations , invectives , turbid language will not necessarily bring the writing in question under condemnation .
what then are these general principles ?
all these spheres constitute the biosphere .
the atmosphere provides oxygen , while the hydrosphere and lithosphere are responsible for water , food and space .
this change is termed as pollution and the agents that institute these changes are called pollutants .
it was only after the industrial revolution that pollution slowly increased .
this in turn has endangered man as well as the flora and fauna around him .
in singapore noise has caused a variety of physical and psychological stresses .
the day is not far when we in india may face a similar situation .
the prime cause of pollution is the growing population .
an increase of 2.4 billion just within two decades has led to the fast depletion of resources and generation of more wastes .
with all sorts of pollution around , man continues to live without sparing any thought for it .
- flakt none can forget one of the most tragic industrial accidents that occurred at bhopal on 3 december , 1984 .
not only bhopal but now every city , every town , every corner of the earth is facing such a crucial problem .
every day , every moment we breathe polluted air to become a victim of air pollution .
as long as this composition is maintained , the air is pure .
the severity of air pollution at calcutta is in no way lesser than that of other cities .
calcutta is considered one of the most polluted cities in the world .
an interesting point to note is that the amount of lead in blood is higher in smokers than in non - smokers .
among the particulate pollutants asbestos needs a special mention .
the use of asbestos has increased severalfolds during the last 30 years .
another dreaded disease caused by polluted air ( containing dust particles ) is silicosis .
silicosis is the most common dust - related disease .
silicosis is often combined with tuberculosis .
effects on plants air pollutants affect the plants directly through the leaves and stems .
this indirect attack is through the roots when solids acidified with pollutants are absorbed .
they interact with other plant stresses such as frost or drought and aggravate the condition .
trees and shrubs are reportedly drying in the gardens of the imperial palace in japan .
in northern bohemia , federal republic of czechoslovakia , polluted air from the brown - coal belt has caused blight in agricultural areas and has heavily damaged forests .
there are three pollutants of prime concern to agriculturists , viz . sulphur dioxide , fluorine compounds and smog .
when only a few cells are injured , a portion of the leaf becomes brownish red in colour or the original green colour becomes bleached .
this effect is known as chlorosis .
in the same year he echoed the sentiment in a famous song which is today the national anthem of india .
they are too well - known to need any introduction or commentary here .
ornaments would mar our union ; they would come between thee and me ; their jingling would drown our whispers . "
dr rosalie bestell views this problem from another angle .
she says that every time a rocket is fired into space , 70 - 150 tonnes of chlorine is dumped in the atmosphere .
in the eighties , about 500 rockets and space shuttles were sent up every year ; by 1989 , the figure had reached 1,500 .
extensive use of nitrates as fertilisers leads to the production of large quantities of nitrous oxide which subsequently gets converted into nitric oxide .
nitric oxide attacks the ozone ( 03 ) to convert it into oxygen .
there are 66 thermal power stations in india which generate about 30 - 40 million tonnes of fly ash per annum or 1 lakh tonnes per day .
with the expected increase in power plants and their capacity , the tonnage of fly ash is estimated to reach about 3.5 lakhs tonnes a day .
such enormous amounts of fly ash should not be wasted , but converted into useful materials .
research is being carried out to convert the fly ash into portland - pozzolona cement , concrete blocks , bricks and cellular concrete .
old engines and equipments increase the quantum of smoke and fumes .
these have to be either set right or if possible , replaced with new ones .
it must be made mandatory that each and every industry likely to pollute air must install air pollution control equipments such as arresters , scrubbers and filters .
thermal power plants and other industries releasing fly ash need to incorporate electrostatic precipitators in their process stream itself .
mere adoption of pollution control measures is not enough .
several thousands lost their eyesight .
who is to be blamed for such a catastrophe ?
how did such a tragic accident occur ?
the leaking mic mingled with the ambient air and poisoned it .
the poisoned air sprawled and spread its tentacles to hook the lives of human beings , cattle and birds in the vicinity of the union carbide factory .
years have rolled by but the spectre of terror still remains with the people of bhopal .
the ph is an index of hydrogen ion concentration of the liquid .
water with a ph less than 7 tends to be acidic while water of ph above 7 is alkaline .
the ph range of acid rain - water is between 2 - 5 .
thus water with ph 4 is more corrosive ( 10 times ) than water with ph 5 .
water of ph 3 is still more corrosive ( 100 times ) than water having a ph 5 .
if this is the case then one can imagine the corrosive nature of acid rain with a ph ranging between . 2 and 3 .
the lowest ph value recorded for a storm in northeastern united states was 2.1 , during november 1964 .
still lower ph value of 1.5 was observed during 1983 at wheeling in west virginia , united states .
in india , rainfall with a ph of 4.8 was recorded at greater bombay during 1974 - 75 .
in agriculture these chemicals are used to protect plants against pests and diseases and to treat seeds .
these pesticides , developed during the past three decades only , though being useful to mankind , have led to a plethora of environmental problems .
to increase agricultural production , a broad spectrum of pesticides was introduced which resulted in the resurgence of pests with more resistance .
hence , it became inevitable to use excess of pesticides and this in turn led to widespread occurrence of pesticide residues in almost all agricultural products .
the presence of pesticidal residues in vegetables , milk , breast - milk , fish and meat have been detected .
most of them are also soluble in fats . thus there is a steady increase in the accumulation of these pesticides in the food chain .
only in very recent years have people woken up to the threat posed by mercury poisoning in the atmosphere .
natural waters contain only a few parts per billion of mercury .
apart from the oil refineries , plastic and battery manufacturing industries also contribute to mercury pollution .
due to exposure to large quantities of mercury , hat - makers became susceptible to impairment of the central nervous system .
in the early fifties hundreds of people died of mercury poisoning at minamata in japan .
the disease , a strange ailment of the people ' s nervous system claimed 400 lives initially during 1950 .
at last on 27 may 1912 , rabindranath sailed for london , accompanied by his son rathindranath and daughter - in - law , pratima .
rothenstein had visited india in 1910 and had come to know the artist - brothers , abanindranath and gaganendranath , during his stay in calcutta .
a city ' s water supply usually comes from a distant location , but its sewage enters nearby waterways .
the oxidisable and fermentable components present in sewage cause a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the receiving water .
deficiency of oxygen leads to the production of a strong stench .
when the suspended matter is of highly organic nature , putrefaction sets in .
as a result , the solid wastes with objectionable odour are buoyed up by gas to float on the water surface .
the pathogenic bacteria cause cholera , typhoid fever and shigella dysentery .
london ' s history provides a classic example .
sewage turned the river thames into a mass of filth , with 20,000 people dying in cholera outbreaks in 1849 and 1853 .
during the same period , typhoid epidemics hit many cities in the usa .
agricultural pollutants in water sewage is not the only source of excess nutrients in surface waters .
modern techniques employed in agriculture and use of a broad spectrum of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have contributed much to environmental degradation , especially to water pollution .
chemical fertilisers are also often washed out of the soil by rain .
the three major pollutants under this category are fertilisers ; pesticides and farm animal wastes .
in recent years there has been an increased use of fertilisers .
fertilisers generally contain one or more of the plant nutrientsnitrogen , phosphorous and potassium .
application of excess fertilisers than what is required is washed and ultimately joins water courses .
among the fertilisers , nitrates cause undesirable effects on rivers and lakes .
the sea of galilee ( lake kinneret ) , fed by the river jordan , provides one - third of water supply of israel .
nitrates from the agricultural areas along the jordan have been flowing into the lake and causing eutrophication .
same is true of detergent phosphates which pass through the sewage systems to break down to phosphorous .
eutrophication is the enrichment of nutrient salts and development of a richer and more varied flora .
the process is sometimes referred to as ' algal bloom ' when the predominant aquatic plant is algae .
these excessive growths later decay to produce foul odours , with a resultant increase in the demand for oxygen .
about 50 - 70 per cent of phosphorous flowing into lakes and rivers of the usa each year , comes from the breakdown of detergent phosphates .
increase in the number of cattle and poultry has also been a cause for water pollution .
a typical example is the distillery .
another major contributor is electroplating wastes which are normally stored inside the factory premises .
though stored in the premises , the wastes percolate through the soil and heavily contaminate the adjoining wells . the major menace is the discharge of effluents over land .
these obscene conditions are prevalent where tanneries and textile processing units are clustered .
for instance , at ambur in tamil nadu such a sight is very common .
' that evening , " writes rothenstein , " i read the poems .
here was poetry of a new order which seemed to me on a level with that of the great mystics .
it was here that tagore first met c . f . andrews who became his lifelong friend and associate .
i wanted to be alone and think in silence of the wonder and glory of it all .
when i had left nevinson i went across the heath . the night was cloudless and there was something of the purple of the indian atmosphere about the sky .
it is hard to tell where to begin . . . we have found our new greece , suddenly .
tagore , however , was not in england when gitanjali was published .
it was thus that gitanjali was first published in english in a limited edition of 750 copies before macmillans of london brought out a popular edition .
three major sources of noise pollution are :
transportation ( surface and air traffic ) .
community activities ( entertainment , construction works , etc . ) .
industrial noise , particularly from mechanical saws and pneumatic drills , can become unbearable and prove a nuisance to the public .
the main menace of noise is the transport system .
a recent aspect of aeroplane noise is the sonic boom .
it causes significant damage to property besides giving a fright to humans and animals .
according to kryter ( 1970 ) , noise causes heart output to decrease with fluctuations in arterial blood pressure and vaso - constriction of peripheral blood vessels .
even our optical system is not spared .
pupillary dilation , impairment of night vision and decrease in the rate of colour perception are some of the adverse effects of noise .
obviously man wants to survive and to do that he must have ' breathable air and drinkable water ' .
he must have clear blue skies and clean streams and unspoilt forests .
environment is the priceless gift of nature .
protection of environment and maintenance of ecological balance is our prime duty .
we must keep the earth lush green so that we all can live together in an environment free from pollution .
we have to protect our environment to protect ourselves .
otherwise the day is not far when man himself may become an endangered species !
as far as an uninitiated person can , guess from a translation , that does not seem to be an exaggeration .
nowadays our god in the west is either the director of the big all world firm inc . , or the primitive imaginary playmate of the childish mind .
he is the one we cry to in the hours of precipitate danger and in the hour of our death .
the young are always drawn to new adventures and both the pupils and the teachers warmly welcomed gandhi ' s advice .
when tagore was told of it , he smiled and said that the experiment contained the key to swaraj .
and so on 10 march 1915 the experiment was launched .
on the following day gandhi left for rangoon .
that the experiment did not last very long surprised neither gandhi nor tagore .
he knew it and yet was hurt by public criticism .
i had been suffering for a time from deep depression and weariness .
but 1 am sane and sound again , and willing , to live another hundred years , if critics would spare me .
at that time i was physically tired ; therefore the least hurt assumed a proportion that , was perfectly absurd .
i must not feel myself too far above my critics .
none has fulfilled these conditions better than rabindranath tagore . "
the strain , physical and emotional , of the german tour affected his health and he longed to return to india to the quite of santiniketan .
later , as the acquaintance ripened , his admiration of tagore knew no bounds .
" rabindranath tagore is the greatest man i have had the privilege to know , " he wrote in 1930 .
" he is very much greater than his world reputation and his position in india imply .
he was deeply impressed , not only with the warm affection with which the common citizens welcomed him but with their genuine interest in philosophical and metaphysical problems .
because of these contacts and friendships tagore retained a very warm affection for czechoslovakia .
if he imagined that he was returning to peace and quiet , he was soon to be disillusioned .
the crown prince , however , professes open sympadiy with die subject people and rebels against die callousness of his own country .
his character provides the main psychological interest of the play , his love of freedom and justice involving him in a conflict of loyalties .
he succeeds .
in that play as in the present one , dhananjaya exhorts the subject people to resist the ruler ' s unjust claims - nonviolently and fearlessly .
a greater sacrifice was the risk he took in exposing his creative leisure and spiritual poise to the clamour of the market place .
would the glare of limelight help to blossom or to wither the sensitive plant so far nurtured in the protective shade of comparative obscurity ?
the poet was losing to the prophet , the singer to the preacher , the devotee to the missionary .
the " endless meaning in the narrow span of a song " was dissolving in the endless preaching over the wide span of the world .
" when i came to this world i had nothing but a reed given to me , which was to find its only value in producing music .
i left my school , i neglected my work , but i had my reed and i played on it ' in mere idle sport . '
tagore returned to india in the latter half of july via japan where he stayed for about six weeks and gave several lectures .
surprisingly enough , no mention was made of tagore at this latter conference held in his own land .
politicians have short memories .
hardly two months at home , then again to the other side of the world .
the occasion was an invitation from the republic of peru to attend the centenary celebrations of her attainment of independence .
amused , the lovely one smiled , " come , let ' s exchange !
take my flowers for your fruit of pain rich with tears ! "
i looked at her and knew that she was ruthless in her beauty .
lightly she picked up my load of fruit and clapped her hands and laughed .
her abundance of flowers i held to my heart .
the sun climbed to the mid - sky and the heat was great .
how i wish i could once again find my way to that foreign land where waits for me the message of love !
the dreams of yesterday will wing their way back and fluttering softly build their nest a new ,
he had suffered so many bereavements that death had ceased to be a stranger .
gandhi ' s visit both failed and succeeded in its purpose .
there was a deep - rooted prejudice in the indian society , whether hindu or muslim , against the public appearance of women on the stage .
as he himself put it , " it is for me to study and not criticise from outside .
that fascism will be remembered in history , there is little doubt .
on arrival in naples he was received by the chief officials of the city with a message of welcome from mussolini .
on 7 june the governor of rome held a public reception in the capital where he conveyed to the poet the greetings of the eternal city .
the linden tree he was made to plant in the park attached to the sanatorium is still cherished as a relic of his visit .
but he could not stay for long and had soon to resume his tour .
the egyptian parliament , then in session , was adjourned in his honour and king fuad presented him with a set of arabic books for visva - bharati .
peace and glory are rarely found together and when they meet , they soon part company .
in java he met , among others , the late president soekarno , then a compartively unknown revolutionary youth .
on the way he landed at pondicherry to visit sri aurobindo ghosh whom he had known in his earlier days of revolutionary political activity .
today i saw him seated in the poise of calm wisdom , and i repeated in silence , aurobindo , accept the salutation of rabindra . "
then came the blow .
i shivered and asked in fear : what more ?
is the final thunderbolt yet to fall ?
it fell could this be all ?
nothing more ?
my fear fell from me .
big you may be , but not bigger than death .
it ' s i who am now bigger than death .
let this be my last word . "
sorrow and defeat were part of life and must be accepted with manly dignity .
such sentimentalism as he sometime indulged in was provoked by his pity for others , pity for life , but rarely by self - pity .
his most dominant feeling was his love of life , his philosophy was but an affirmation of it .
the joy of living and exercising his sensibilities was to him a gift divinely dispensed for which he never ceased to be grateful .
the night has waned and the world ' s petals unfold .
on the bark of this noble tree are inscribed the music of this wheel revolving and rolling onward , invisibly , inaudibly , had never ceased to fascinate him .
must he still keep on pouring himself out and be emptied completely ?
as the title indicates , he thought that they marked the end of his creative career .
but in fact they marked only the end of a phase which had begun eighteen years earlier , in 1914 , with , balaka .
it was a majestic phase which had begun and ended splendidly .
the urge to preach and to reform the world was also cooling down .
you have been to me a true friend because you have been a candid friend often speaking your thoughts aloud . . .
if your heart approves of the action i want your blessing .
it will sustain me . "
our sorrowing hearts will follow your sublime penance with reverence and love . "
on 24 september , tagore , unable to keep away , left for poona . to visit the mahalma in yeravdajail .
tagore had been persuaded by the university of calcutta to accept the chair of bengali , in which capacity he now delivered a series of lectures .
both these plays , tasher desk and chandalika , were staged in calcutta in september .
the lectures delivered at the andhra university were later published as man .
her very suspicions , which she took no care to hide , provoked fate and brought about what she most feared .
she who was generous when happy became unjust and vindictive .
bansari is a witty play , sparkling with brilliant dialogue .
it depicts the sophistication of high society in calcutta , their highbrow pretensions and snobberies .
his own acquaintance with the life and types of characters he was depicting was remote , largely - derived from hearsay and gossip .
his treatment of love was becoming more and more intellectualised , bolder in thought but less potent in conveying its feeling .
not only the flesh and blood but perhaps the heart , too was getting old , only the mind was active and in full armour .
returning to santiniketan at the beginning of january 1934 , he received , a fortnight later , jawaharlal nehru and his wife , kamala .
meanwhile on 15 january , north india was rocked by an earthquake of great severity , causing great damage to life and property in several towns of bihar .
" a man like me cannot but believe that this earthquake is a divine chastisement sent by god for our sins . .
for me there is a vital connection between the bihai calamity and the untouchability campaign . "
this was not , of course , the only reason .
the artist in him itched to see his own creations on the stage .
unlike his other written works , the songs had to be sung to be enjoyed , the ballets staged to be appreciated .
he began it with punsacha ( the postscript ) , published soon after pariseshin 1932 .
many of them are reminiscent and some in the first person singular , though what is in first person singular need not always be reminiscent or autobiographical .
once he had to face the challenge of a celebrated pandit from the south .
jaseem asked his young daughter amina to take the turban to the near - by stream and wash it .
when the pandit came to fetch his turban he noticed the second verse and stared at the dyer ' s daughter .
then he said , " maiden , you have transformed the arrogance of my intellect into wisdom of the heart .
i cannot now go back to the royal court .
my way lies elsewhere . "
he took her love and devotion for granted .
he replied , " why , am i not there ?
can you not see me ? "
our school was rushing forward madly , with arithmetic and grammar books running fast .
the maps were fluttering on the wall like birds flapping their wings .
the bells tolled ceaselessly and without break , with no heed of the hour .
if she prefers delhi , lahore or agra all we need do is to put a turban on her head and horned shoes on her feet .
or if she wished to rush off to england , all the people will become hatted coated and booted englishmen ! "
today since early morning a petulant little girl named giribala has entered my imaginary world . "
giribala lives in bengali literature as one of the most lovable specimens of indian womanhood .
she chided , " youdon ' thave to do this . " he remained silent . but in the end he won her friendship .
a gold ring she gave him one day with something sweet inscribed on it .
while bathing in the ganges it slipped from his finger and was lost .
" the lock is not there , and the key does no fit . "
introducing these poems he wrote that his poetry had changed its season from time to time , often without his being aware of it .
these poems were his tete - a - tete with the new age that was taking birth all around him .
it needs to be pointed out that these various volumes were not written as separate bunches , each at a stretch and representing a uniform mood or phase .
many poems published in separate volumes were actually written almost simultaneously .
these varying moods were expressed in widely differing poems which were later sorted out and published in different volumes .
the poems of navajatak are comparatively less subjective in mood and reflect his keen interest in the world around .
the very themes and metaphors employed indicate this objective concern : the radio , the railway train , the station , the aeroplane , hindustan , rajasthan . etc .
the poem referred to earlier , mocking the japanese militarists praying to buddha , the compassionate , is from this collection and was written in january 1938 .
the death of this devoted friend was a deeply felt personal bereavement to the poet .
and so the active contacts between the two had of late diminished , though the old bond had survived .
he sat on the ground , burnt an incense and chanted an invocation to the buddha .
the poet was moved and expressed his feeling in a poem he wrote the next day .
they brought flowers , heaps of them , for the poet .
one of these relates the story of the skeleton which used to hang in the class - room of the child rabi for lessons in elementary science .
between the discarded palanquin and the neglected child there was a secret fellow - feeling and comradeship .
the child would sprawl within its closed shutters safe from all prying eyes and give full rein to his fancy .
the oars fall into the water with a gentle splash , the waves swing and swell around us .
the sailors cry out to us to beware , a storm is coming .
on 3 september he presided over the festival of rain at santiniketanfor the last time .
the golden bell of morning rings ding dong ,
this was written on 25 september .
once again " with stealthy steps the messenger of death came creeping out of the lightless cavern of the universe . "
as during the previous crisis , no adequate medical help was readily available , and kalimpong was even farther from calcutta than santiniketan .
few experiences are more immediately painful than a scorpion sting .
the latterwere published in 1941 as galpa - salpa ( tales and trifles ) .
and that is the big news , that the world is in need of a drastic adjustment .
it is told to little kusmi by her dadamashai ( grandfather ) whom she is always asking , " what ' s the big news today ? "
but kusmi can make this book of parables and tales as well as the volume of poems janmadine discussed earlier were published in april 1941 .
on that day ( 14 april 1941 ) was delivered the poet ' s last public address , published as sabhyatar sankat ( crisis in civilisation ) .
" as i look around i see the crumbling ruins of a proud civilisation strewn like a vast heap of ftitility .
and yet i shall . not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in man .
his own physical suffering , the burden of a body tormented with pain , with little or no respite ' .
the daily toll of suffering went on rising , the fever rose higher each evening and the nights were increasingly restless .
the team of leading physicians and surgeons who came periodically from calcutta insisted on his removal to calcutta for a major operation .
even gandhi had to yield and submit to an operation .
" why ca n ' t i be allowed to die in peace ? " he protested .
" momently i feel the time draws near for me to leave . "
they would miss no chance , however feeble , of saving a life so valuable , and he could not reject the importunities of the dear and near ones .
so he yielded most reluctantly and against his better instinct .
on 25 july he was taken to calcutta .
an answer either way would be naive , too simple to be true .
tagore ' s is really an affirmation of a truth that is beyond faith and doubt , or is inclusive of both doubt and faith .
what the poet uttered was the stark truth thatoi the ultimate mystery of life and the universe he has no knowledge .
what he really is beneath and beyond the body , he does not know .
but he was not a materialist or a nihilist as the words are normally understood .
basically a man of faith , his faith was brave and true , for it had been tested in the fire of suffering .
but in this case he had no chance to do so .
these stupas and chaityas show their own distinct regional characters as against their compeers in north and north - western india .
buddhism almost went into complete eclipse soon ; the hindu temples to a greater extent and the jain ones to a lesser extent predominating .
an attempt has been made in the following pages to portray in outline the temples of the south .
the extant portion of this vast literature embodies in itself earlier and contemporary traditions , many of which still persist .
all these would constitute a class of hypaethral temples , that is , temples open to the air and devoid of a roof over the object of worship .
this part of the scene has three trees , with the bases of two of them enclosed by a railing .
this has also an inscription below it , calling it ' bahuputm - chaitya of vaisali ' .
according to buddha - ghosha , this was a many - branched tree where people prayed for sons .
on the top of the anda is the harmika square on plan and enclosing an umbrella ( chhatra ) or a series of them ( chhatravali ) .
the harvest of his field has been gathered and he fills the boat with it .
there was a time when a storm of controversy raged in the literary circles of bengal as to the real meaning of this poem .
what is the golden boat and who is at its helm ?
the golden boat reappears in the last poem of the book , but now the poet has been taken into the boat .
will hope yield at last its golden harvest ? "
you looked at my face and smiled and said not a word .
iconic forms of siva , vishnu , surya , kartikeya , sri , durga and other gods were also evolved .
this resulted in the delayed development of its indigenous literatures which thus do not supply much material regarding the purely local traditions and beliefs of the very early times .
but many contemporary material relics indicating the religious forms and places of worship are extant and have come up , as in north india , in the latest excavations .
the most important examples of this group are the sudama ( nyagrodha ) and the lomas rishi caves .
these two caves exactly reproduce the plan of the suddhamma deva sabha in the barhut relief .
such examples are found in the vicinity of poona and nasik , and ajanta and aurangabad .
the poem is one long paean in praise of this lowly earth and its siniple human attachments .
it is a poem such as mahatma gandhi might have written had he been a poet .
the linga - pitha is generally square , but octagonal in the eastern cave - temple , at malai - yakkovil .
in the cave - temples at piranmalai and tirumalai ( ramanathapuram district ) it is only siva and parvati ( umasahitamurti ) seated , without skanda .
the other iconographic forms so reproduced are lingodbhava , harihara , subrahmanya , vishnu with garuda in human form , narasimha , and the tandava forms , of siva .
these bas - relief sculptures are more akin to the pallava than to the neighbouring pandya forms .
the other cave - temples are those at tirunandikkara and kaviyur .
a nandi - mandapa is also to be seen in front in some cases as in the lankesvara cave at ellora ( kailasa complex ) .
the sandhara and sarvatobhadra forms are the most outstanding .
the embellished median band , or patta , common in the chalukyan corbels , is absent .
though smaller than the badami cave - temples , these are interesting from the point of view of plan , design and sculpture .
the pillar ' s are more slender and have the usual capital components of the ' order ' .
the slightly projecting dividing wall - strips between the mandapa and rear shrine , leaving a wide entrance in between , carry the dvarapala sculptures .
on the facade on either flank on the rock wall are niches containing the sculptures of the two nidhissankha and padma .
the jain cave - temple has a front mandapa which is more pronouncedly rectangular , and conforms to the typical mandapa - type cave - temple pattern .
there are , of course , variations of plan and content in some .
the corbels , where present , are either simple or ornate .
the ramesvara ( cave 21 ) would represent the earliest of this group .
but tell me , have you nothing more to ask for than leave to depart ?
have all your desires been fulfilled none left lingering in your heart to prick like a hidden thorn ? "
" none , " kacha assures her .
there they are waiting to welcome you back with music and conch shells and flowers .
kacha feels the sting and begs , " not thus with a reproach , but with a smile bid me farewell . "
" smile !
this is no paradise , my friend .
the patalesvara at poona has gajalakshmi , tripurantaka , anantasayin , lingodbhava and andhakari .
mahur depicts ardhanari , gangadhara , tripurantaka , ganesa , kartikeya and surya .
these cave - temples of eastern chalukyan authorship show individualistic characters in their lay - out , iconography and the scheme of the cella .
they partake in some respects of the neighbouring pallava modes , apart from their parental chalukyan and northern inheritance .
practically all the cave - temples are saiva , or are dedicated to other deities of the saiva pantheon .
these along with other houses and streets outside the outermost seventh prakara , constitute a modem municipal town .
the four - sided square or oblong plans , and the curvilinearcircular , elliptical and apsidal plansbecome familiar even in the earlier buddhist and non - buddhist temples .
but the hexagonal or octagonal plan that is found introduced in the make - up of the southern vimana would be rather uncommon .
the number of storeys could be increased to three or four ( tritala , chatushtala , etc . ) , in which case they were called jati vimanas .
he begs to be forgiven .
what forgiveness , o brahmin , is left in the heart of a woman flamed to the fury of a thunderbolt ?
you will go back to the celestial realm where all regrets will be lost in the pride of your success .
but what is left to me here what ambition or mission can instil a meaning or pride in this thwarted and barren life of mine ?
these shapes indicate regional developments and also chronological evolution .
such free - standing torana entrances or stambha toranas are stated to have preceded the gopura entrances of ancient palaces .
the gable - window - like arched kudu ornaments on the kapota , of the prastara are fronted by toranas bereft of the supporting columns .
when closed they have a series of pilasters against the inner faces of the walls .
on their outer faces the external scheme obtaining in the main vimana is followed .
the names kotikal mandapam , orukal mandapam , idaichi mandapa , etc . indicate this .
such simple mandapa pillars do not have differentiated capital mouldings , but bear the potika or corbel block directly over the top square section .
this chaturvarga ratha represents the kuta type with a four - sided domical roof , or sikhara , crowned by a single stupi or finial .
in having a square platform base to apex , it exemplifies the pure nagara order .
it is dedicated to durga whose standing sculpture in relief , with attendants , is carved on the rear wall of the sanctum .
the main doorway is framed by a fine torana as also the three devakoshthas which also enshrine standing relief sculptures of durga on the three side walls .
it has a small ardha - mandapa and the aditala has a single wall , hence it is nirandhara .
the mandapa carries above its prastara a ham of kutas at the four corners and sala in between , over the sides .
the oblong sanctum facing west was perhaps intended for a reclining form of vishnu with his head to the south and legs to the north .
the oblong griva , which rises as an upper continuation of the garbha - griha walls , is rather tall .
the three larger ones represent full nasikas with the prastara element in their composition .
but even a deeper conflict is that of personal loyalties .
there is no answer to this dilemma and the choice must take its tragic course .
the next major volume of verse , chaitali , was published in 1896 .
before the sense of india ' s past overwhelms him in the next phase , he will glean a few immortal moments from the immediate present .
the former carries on the four corners of its aditala four elephant figures as symbols for subrahmanya kartikeya , instead of the later and usual peacock forms .
the dvitala talinatha temple at tiruppattur ( ramanathapuram district ) and the similar siva temple in tiruvalisvaram ( tirunelveli district ) are slightly larger examples .
the former has four karnakuta miniature shrines at the corners of the topmost tala in place of the nandis .
the second tala rising over the inner circular wall is square , while the third , as also the griva and sikhara above , is circular in section .
the aditala ham , extended over the top of the front mandapa , also shows a series of dance sculptures .
the hara contains a series of fine sculptures .
this was the work of chavundaraya , the minister of ganga rachamalla ( 974 - 984 ) .
to this complex have been added two more lateral vimanas in front of the common mandapa of the trikuta nucleus .
the whole is surrounded by a prakara with a small gopura entrance on the north .
the granite temples of nandi ( kolar district ) , the capital of the banas , are of ganga - nolamba extraction .
this nuclear twin is enlarged with the addition of later axial mandapas and peripheral structures into a complex with prakara and gopura on the east .
the arunachalesvara would appear to be almost a later copy of the bhoganandisvara .
thus it would appear to be no more than a large assembly hall converted into a temple with a shrine inside at the rear .
the extant moulded basement is in hard granite stone .
an inscription of the twenty - fourth year of pallava nandivarman iii , on the extant structure itself calls it a mandapa , not a temple ( vimana ) .
the structure is of the time of dantivarman ( ad 796 - 846 ) .
these temples have all a typically chalukyan plinth form , with nirandhara or single - walled aditala and with a narrower ardha - mandapa in front .
it combines all that is best in temple - building traditionarchitecture , sculpture , painting and allied arts .
a rich disciple proud of his wealth came to the sikh guru and offered a pair of gold bangles in wrought with precious stones .
the guru let one bangle slip from his hand into the river below .
the disciple jumped into the river to retrieve the costly gift .
failing to find it he begged the guru to indicate the exact spot where it had fallen .
the guru threw the remaining bangle into the water and said , " there ! "
here is one about an ancient hindu sage who taught the sacred sciences to young brahmins .
a little boy , poor but eager to learn , came and begged ' to be accepted as a pupil .
the sage asked him if he was a brahmin and who his father was .
the date of the latter temple is precisely indicated by its inscription as ad 1112 .
the navaranga forms a larger square in front , its outer walls and adhishthana similarly relieved and recessed , and with similar external ornamentation .
there is the buddhist tale of the monk upagupta , a disciple of the buddha .
vasavadatta , the beautiful courtesan of the city , had stumbled against him in the dark on her way to a tryst with a lover .
the monk looked at her and said softly , " o bunch of loveliness , not yet .
go where you are going now . when the time comes i shall myself come to you . "
the mandapa has open corners between the three shrines and on its two sides , and its pillars inside are lathe - turned .
this is attached in front of the unit to an intervening nandi - mandapa .
another interesting feature of this ruined temple within the fort is the elaborate freestanding toranas marking the entrances .
the temples at palampet ( warangal district ) form another interesting group .
the bases of the peripheral pillars of the mandapa are also connected by a vedi and a balustrade forming the lean - back of the kakshasana .
while the main structure is of reddish sandstone , the decorations are of polished basalt or hornblende , which are stones of the hard variety .
the whole stands on a prominent and well - moulded upa - pitha .
the recesses between the pilasters contain the usual short and slender pilaster motif surmounted by a shrine superstructure over its abacus .
the main structure is like the great temple of palampet in size , plan and elevation .
inside the mandapa there are minor shrines arranged on the periphery , five of them extant , as in the palampet temple again .
the roof of the mandapa is lost .
the sala type roof or chadya over this vestibule , rising to the height of the next vimana tala , is again a system of superposed cornices .
the mandapas and gopuras are , as in all vijayanagar temples , remarkable for their great size .
the mandapas are often of the thousand - pillared variety .
for the ashes , carried away by the wind , are now scattered all over the earth and the anguish of sex repressed never ceases to trouble men .
the poet ' s foreboding of the spiritual crisis and the cross that lay ahead of him is also reflected in several poems .
the downwardly flexed arm has a horizontal connective bar below it , connecting the free tip with the main block .
the kumbha panjara motif on the wall recesses of vimanas , gopuras and mandapas is made more ornate and elaborate .
these mandapas , the kalyana - or utsava - mandapas , are noted for their fine and intricately - worked colonnades in hard - stone .
the aniyottikkals , as they are called , are characteristic of the vijayanagar style .
the vitthala complex stands inside a high - walled , paved enclosure , with three gopura entrances , south and north .
there are also axial and accessory mandapas and ancillary shrines .
the axial series consisting of vimanas with front mandapas stands on an ornate platform , carved with friezes of men , horses , hamsa , and small shrine motifs .
the steps leading up to the frontal agra - mandapa are flanked by the large stone elephants .
the agra - mandapa itself contains huge monolithic pillars with carved - out columnettes , or with large vyalas having riders on their backs .
the superstructure of the vimana is of brickwork .
there are also shrines for other attendant deities in the courtyard .
the krishna temple built by krishnadeva raya in 1513 is another handsome temple complex with the usual components of attendant shrines , the mandapas and pillared malikas and gopura .
built by achyuta raya ( 1530 - 1542 ) , it is noted for its great size and huge proportions .
its pillars are , however , handsome and it contains some fine sculptures .
the temple was dedicated to anantasayin vishnu , but the deity is now missing .
the shrine front has three doors to render the head , body and feet of the reclining god visible from the antarala .
the hazara rama temple was probably begun earlier and was completed by krishnadeva raya .
the central power was much weakened .
the vijayanagar viceroys in the southern regions , the nayakas , gradually assumed independent powers .
some of them fostered temple architecture and created some notable temples .
built of fine - grained granite , it exhibits in the mouldings of its adhishthana and pilasters of its wall some fine and intricate engraving .
the double - flexed kapota is thin and elegant showing the ribbed supporting frame - work on its under side .
the griva and sikhara of the square vimana are hexagonal , in conformity with the six - faced shanmukha form of subrahmanya installed in the sanctum .
this and other temples thus formed easily the pattern for the living art of the modern sthapati or temple - builder of south india .
such work can be seen in the rock fort temple at tiruchirapalli , madurai , and other places .
similarly , there are many small nayaka temples inside the chandragiri fort .
the srirangam venugopala temple shows noticeably far advanced architectural and sculptural features of the local regional style .
the ikkeri nayakas have left temples of a chalukyan affiliation in their capital towns of ikkeri , keladi , and in other places in their area .
the aghoresvara temple at ikkeri ( shimoga district ) is the largest and finest of the ikkeri style of temples .
in the navabrahma complex of nine temples in alampur , all except the tarakabrahma , which is of the southern vimana type , are of this variety .
they mostly date earlier than ad 713 when , as stated in an inscription , the prakara enclosing the whole group was built by isanacharya .
they are mostly nirandhara while a few are sandhara .
each unit consists of a sanctum with a well - proportioned tri ratha sikhara , an antarala and pillared mandapa with a two - tiered flat roof .
the exterior wall faces are richly carved with niches , surmounted by udgama motifs containing fine sculptures and lattice windows .
the carvings are fine , and reminiscent of the central indian and rajasthani styles .
the balabrahma is the most advanced and elaborate specimen of the group .
what one perceives of the srikoyil is in fact an external shell , as it were , of a core vimana or garbhakudya inside .
he is not afraid of pain any longer .
for even in his other worldly and god - conscious moods , rabindranath could not and would not avert his face from this life and earth .
but bahadur shah had neither the guts , nor the power , nor the will left to say anything .
the britishers , prior to 1857 , were no sovereign rulers of india and bahadur shah was not their subject , though he was awarded a pension .
the verdict cannot be termed as a judicial verdict after hearing both the parties .
bahadur shah , a sovereign , should not have been tried at all .
moreover , he was not in a mental state to face such a trial and defend himself effectively .
he was 82 - years - old .
every friend and follower , including his wife , zeenat mahal , had almost deserted him .
the trial lasted more than two months .
at no stage was there any doubt about the verdict .
on the 29th of march , 1858 , bahadur shah was found guilty of all the charges and . subsequently sentenced to be transported for life to rangoon .
he died on 7th november , 1862 in rangoon .
he founded , on 26th july , 1876 , the indian association which was intended to be the centre of an all - indian political movement .
he undertook tours all over india to awaken the spirit of unity and solidarity among the people .
surendra nath played a leading role in the indian national congress too , and twice became its president in 1895 and 1902 .
he took part in the agitation against the partition of bengal in 1905 and in the subsequent ' swadeshi ' and ' boycott ' movements .
his leadership at the barisal conference made him the ' uncrowned king of bengal ' .
he was a frank and fearless man and for his undaunted courage was imprisoned for contempt of the high court .
he spoke against corrupt judiciary and set an example for times to come and paved the way for the right of freedom of expression .
surendra nath banerjea was editor of an english newspaper in which he wrote a leading article on 28th april , 1883 .
it seems that on previous occasions also , justice norris had acted with prejudice against the indians while deciding cases .
the language of the article was strident and censorious .
it was a frontal attack on judiciary and more particularly . upon a sitting english judge of the high court .
he had the courage to say that a case like his could not be tried summarily .
the case was taken up on 4th may , 1883 and the judgment was delivered the next day .
your counsel , though invited to do so , has wholly failed to explain to the satisfaction of the court why that article was inserted .
and you must have known perfectly well that the affidavits , upon which the rule was issued , were not directed to the subject of that article .
" these matters in your affidavit , so far from extenuating your offence , appear to the court to be an aggravation of it .
the court order is that you be imprisoned on the civil side of presidency jail for the space of two months . "
there have been in this court two cases of a similar nature since its establishment .
the matter was discussed fully , and after the court had pronounced its decision that they were guilty , suitable apologies were made .
tilak was tried and convicted for sedition by an english jury after three weeks of prolonged trial in the bombay high court wherein he led his own defence .
he said , " all i wish to say is that inspite of the verdict of the jury , i maintain that i am innocent .
in the annals of indian legal trials , no other trial has its parallel .
we have met here today to make atonement for the suffering that was caused by these convictions to a great and distinguished son of india .
that disgrace tarnished our record and we are here to remove that tarnish and that disgrace .
he did his best to prejudice the minds of the special jury , who themselves had no knowledge of marathi .
in support of the charge under section 153 - a , he read the article from the kesari .
the gist of the article published on 12th may , as given by the prosecutor , may be quoted here :
" all thoughtful people , seem now to have formed the opinion as to the cause that gave birth to the ' bomb party ' .
the bomb exploded owing to the official class having tried the patience of the bengali youth .
even his admirers and well - wishers were inclined to believe that die school was at best a poet ' s whim .
the school , however , was not a poet ' s whim .
a poet ' s dream it undoubtedly was , for who but a poet could " bring the earliest tidings of the unborn flower to a sceptic would ? "
that is a burden which the defence cannot be made to bear .
it is for the prosecution to prove that the translation is correct .
here the charge is based on the english translation and not on the driginal marathi article .
here there are differences between the original words in marathi in the kesari and the words used in the translations . "
tilak submitted that a healthy criticism of administration was a part of his duty as a public worker and a journalist .
it was the duty of every indian .
it was a brilliant 22 - hour defence by tilak , spread over six days .
he explained that the kesari articles were meant to warn the government that a policy of repression was not correct .
even if you do not agree , you are entitled to say that in your opinion the matter does not come under section 124 - a .
you may agree or not with me , you may accept my views or not accept my views .
it is not a matter of whether the views are correct .
i may , who knows , alter my views .
gentlemen , come to your views .
you will presently hear what the advocate general has to say and after him his lordship will address you .
the responsibility is yours ; you will have to return a verdict of ' guilty ' or ' not guilty ' .
coming from the people and knowing their sentiments and thoughts you will have to say what you think would be the effect .
i would ask you to forget all other circumstances outside this court .
no less important , said tagore , is the influence of music and of the fine arts in training the child ' s emotions and his sensibility .
education to be real must be of the whole man , of the emotions and the senses as much as of the intellect .
and so in his school , along with training in individual initiative and self - reliance , equal emphasis was laid on community service .
if it does not strike roots in the soil and adapt itself to the natural environments , it has little value for the people as a whole .
he loved children , loved being with them , and loved teaching them .
it was his faith that every child carried a message from god that he had not yet despaired of man .
finding that there were no suitable primers and textbooks available in bengali he wrote them himself and encouraged his colleagues to do the same .
the poet could drudge as well as sing .
these were published in a small volume of twenty - seven poems remarkable for their depth of tender ness and for their simplicity of utterance .
" my night has passed on the bed of sorrow , and my eyes are tired . "
but infinite is thy mansion , my lord , and seeking her i have come to thy door . "
the volume was published a year later as smaran ( remembrance ) .
grief disguised is more potent than grief expressed .
i merely observe that the king ' s name is omitted from the charge - sheet and in my opinion very properly . "
the advocate general ( sir t . strangman , special public prosecutor ) asked the court not to convict on the pleas but to proceed with the trial .
sir t . strangman submitted as follows :
" i maintain that the articles contained in the charge are part of an organised campaign which has lasted for years .
secondly , mr gandhi is an educated man and a recognised leader and this makes the campaign all the more harmful .
the court must consider the inevitable result of this campaign as shown by recent events .
the offence of the second accused is of less gravity but nonetheless serious .
in this case there should be a substantial fine . "
i admit the blame for the crimes of violence committed in bombay , madras and elsewhere .
it is true that i ought to know the consequences of my acts .
i admit that i have been playing with fire , but should do so again if released .
i feel it necessary that i should do this as my duty to my people .
i do not ask for any mercy .
the court must do its duty .
mahatmaji finished reading his statement and for a few seconds there was complete silence in the hall .
i have to deal with you in one character only .
there are , probably , few people in india who do not sincerely regret that you should have made it impossible for any government to leave you at liberty .
i am trying to balance what is due to you against what appears to me to be necessary in the interests of the public .
and i propose in passing sentence to follow the precedent of a case , in many respects similar to this case , that was decided some twelve years ago .
the sentence that was passed upon him , as it finally stood , was a sentence of simple imprisonment for six years .
it was that issue which elevated the trial to the highest plane and the characters too , who played their part in it .
it was a trial in the history of criminal trials in india where not a single pie was spent for by the defendant for defence .
there was no defence counsel , no legal advice , but the accused earned eternal glory in india ' s moral and legal firmament .
s . a . dange the meerut conspiracy case trial was one of the most notorious trials to take place during the british regime .
they were charged under section 121 - a of the indian penal code .
the trial become notorious on account of its uprecedented duration .
he lacked the mahatma ' s tireless patience and persistence , his calm judgement and unruffled will , his genius for strategy and his unrivalled gift of leadership .
the tide is symbolic of the poet ' s mood of wistful expectancy , of waiting for the ferry to cross over to the other bank .
the trial in the sessions court started in the first week of june , 1929 .
the public prosecutor who conducted the case for the crown produced few more witnesses on behalf of the prosecution .
once the prosecution evidence had been completed , bhagat singh felt that the stage had been reached when he should make a detailed statement on behalf of their cause .
he had worked hard to prepare his written statement himself .
that historic statement was read out to the court by asaf ali on behalf of bhagat singh and dutt on 6th june .
the statement forms a glorious chapter in the history of revolutionary ideas in india and is a masterly piece of a document based on revolutionary and marxian principles .
the statement was so touching that three of the four assessors could not hide their eyes dimmed with tears .
is the charge , as framed by the lower court , correct or otherwise ?
the other witnesses , too , who have deposed to having seen bombs being thrown by us have no scruples to tell lies .
" the bomb was necessary to awaken england from her dreams .
our sole purpose was to make the deaf hear and give the heedless a timely warning .
we have only hoisted the " danger signal ' to warn those who are speeding along without heeding to the grave dangers ahead .
" prisoner , tell me who wrought this unbreakable chain ? "
" it was i , " said the prisoner , " who forged this chain with great care .
i thought my chain would bind the world leaving me free .
and so i laboured at it , day and night , beating the iron in fire .
when the chain was ready , i discovered that i had bound myself in its shackles . "
she blushed with shame .
what could she give him ?
kundan lal and prem dutt were awarded imprisonment for seven and five years respectively .
ajoy ghosh , j . n . sanyal and des raj were acquitted .
the legal battle was not over even after the death sentence .
on 10th february , 1931 , the petition was rejected by the privy council .
it further united the freedom fighters in their struggle against the british .
it was decided by the government that the execution of the sentence would take place on 23rd march , 1931 .
after release , he joined the indian national congress .
on the controversial issue of the indian national congress helping the british government in the second world war , he resigned .
i was attracted to him because he seemed such a lonely figure , deserted by everybody .
the warrant was issued and made over to cecil kaye .
m . n . roy returned to india secretly in december , 1930 .
roy , during the sessions trial , wanted to make a lengthy statement in his defence , but was not allowed to make it .
it was later smuggled out from jail and published under the title ' my defence ' .
it is a remarkable legal document which has established its place in legal history .
it gives ample proof of industry , intelligence and the wide knowledge of m . n . roy .
replying to the accusation of the intention to use ' criminal ' force , he stated :
" but in reality force is force .
judgment was reserved until 9th january , 1932 when roy was sentenced to 12 years ' transportation .
immediately plans were made for appeal to the high court and to the privy council , if necessary .
by the end of 1932 , he had returned to europe .
with singh ' s sudden departure , roy was crippled in his effort to prepare for the hearing of his appeal .
it proved difficult to assemble the papers of the case , which had been in singh ' s care .
in the course of five tempestuous years tagore suffered an almost total break - up of his family life .
loneliness in the midst of the crowd is even more oppressive and so for a time he retired into solitude on his estate at shelidah .
that was the only visible expression of the heavy hand of sorrow that lay on his heart .
" seventh charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said captain p . k . sehgal alone ) .
" eight charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said lt . gurbaksh singh dhillon alone ) .
" ninth charge : i . a : a . section 41 ( against the said captain p . k sehgal alone ) .
" tenth charge : i . a . a . section 41 ( against the said captain shah nawaz khan alone ) .
he was a political suspect and was under watch .
his religious insight , like that of all great saints and mystics , was born of deeply experienced sorrow and loneliness .
he sought god not merely in the privacy of his soul but in every manifestation of his play in the outside world .
they were across - examined by the defence counsel and thereafter the statements of all the three accused were recorded .
capt . shah nawaz khan questioned the authority of the court to try him .
in his statement he explained how and why he joined the indian national army .
he said , " in short , the question before me was the king or the country .
i decided to be loyal to my country and gave my word of honour to netaji that i would sacrifice myself for her sake .
we fought only for india ' s independence .
i also maintain that my trial by court martial is illegal .
interesting questions regarding the law of belligerency were discussed .
the existence of war was purely a question of fact .
according to the maxim of international law , the successful revolution would be the government established by law .
before sheikh abdullah is convicted , these questions must be considered very carefully and weighed in the spirit of the grave responsibility because of the repercussions which are inevitable .
the mischief of conviction is greater than even the mischief caused by the alleged speeches or rather by the arrest of the accused .
the remedy sought is worse than the disease .
you convict and incarcerate a person and all possibility of reconciliation between the ruler and the ruled is washed out .
do not let the people think that the raising of their voices by their leaders means only convictions , sentences , misery and wretchedness .
the court passed the following order : " offences under section 124 - a r . p . c . for all the three speeches are proved against him .
in default of payment of . fine , he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for three months on each count .
the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently . "
sheikh abdullah was convicted on 10th september , 1946 .
india achieved independence on 15th august , 1947 .
the ' lion of kashmir ' was soon made the first chief minister of kashmir .
the trial of sheikh abdullah imparted futher impetus to the ' quit kashmir ' movement which now spread to other parts of the country .
what is unicode ?
unicode provides a unique number for every character ,
no matter what the platform ,
no matter what the program ,
no matter what the language .
fundamentally , computers just deal with numbers .
they store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one .
before unicode was invented , there were hundreds of different encoding systems for assigning these numbers .
even for a single language like english no single encoding was adequate for all the letters , punctuation , and technical symbols in common use .
these encoding systems also conflict with one another .
unicode is changing all that !
it is supported in many operating systems , all modern browsers , and many other products .
the emergence of the unicode standard , and the availability of tools supporting it , are among the most significant recent global software technology trends .
incorporating unicode into client - server or multi - tiered applications and websites offers significant cost savings over the use of legacy character sets .
it allows data to be transported through many different systems without corruption .
the membership of the consortium represents a broad spectrum of corporations and organizations in the computer and information processing industry .
for more information , see the glossary , unicode enabled products , technical introduction and useful resources .
irrespective of the country and place , a hue and cry about pollution is being raised now .
pollution befouls the air and poisons water .
to meet the growing needs for power , hydro - electric , thermal , and nuclear power plants are being increasingly set up .
the net result is pollution of air and water everywhere .
air pollution in cities has mounted with more and more people getting drawn to the urban centres .
some of them are also carried to distant places by wind , rain and rivers .
these are also present in the high mountains and in seaside swamps , and are hazardous for human beings , animals , birds and fish .
another kind of pollution that has come into prominence more recently is radiation which is a result of the growth of nuclear power and nuclear weapons .
radioactive materials find their way into the atmosphere and water courses causing mutagenetic effects .
mining operations , especially in reserve forests and sanctuaries , are posing a serious threat to the environment .
all kinds of animals , including the tiger , are virtually fighting for survival .
lastly , mention has to be made about pollution caused by noise .
pollution is like a tiger lurking in the bush , ready to pounce upon us at any time , leading to total destruction .
it is like the damocle ' s sword hanging over our head .
the human race is trying to commit suicide the pistol being pollution .
we have poisoned the air , water , and soil with pollutants .
we have upset natural communities in ways that are affecting our place in the complex system that has been called ' the great chain of life ' .
and we may soon be tipping the balance of the natural forces in the earth , atmosphere and oceans in ways that could be disastrous for mankind .
we have reached a point where we must protect the environment in order to protect ourselves .
air pollution has never been as bad as it is now .
even as we benefit from industrial progress , we must ensure that the very air we breathe remains unpoisoned . "
for instance , a 500 - mw thermal power plant produces 2,000 tonnes of ash every day , in addition to smoke .
other significant industries contributing to air pollution are cement , steel and ore processing industries .
the automobile exhausts are in no way less dangerous than the industrial smoke .
it is reported that automobiles at greater calcutta alone spew about 1,500 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere every day .
delhi ' s vehicular strength in 1992 was estimated to be about 19 lakhs . the number of motor vehicles plying in madras city is nearing 5 lakhs .
at hyderabad the number of motor vehicles is estimated to be 4.7 lakhs which emit 450 . tonnes of smoke and fumes a day .
persons already suffering from diseases like anaemia are more prone to get affected because carbon monoxide may lead to serious injuries to vital organs .
it has been reported that lower levels of concentration of sulphur dioxide cause temporary spasm of the smooth muscles of the bronchia .
it may also cause acute irritation of the eye membranes resulting in tears and redness .
hydrogen sulphide is well known for its characteristic rotten - egg odour .
lead , which is discharged into the air via the automobile exhaust , is a cumulative poison that may cause brain damage in children .
a report on the donora ( usa ) industrial accident showed that about 20 per cent of the canary population and 15 per cent dogs were affected .
plumbism or lead poisoning among cattle , sheep and horses is a common phenomenon .
air contaminated with ozone acts as an irritant and can be responsible for pulmonary changes , oedema and haemorrhage in dogs , cats and rabbits .
bone lesions in animals due to excessive fluorides have also been reported .
diarrhoea , weight loss , lowered fertility and reduced milk production are some of the other effects of fluoride pollution .
the resultant oil slick led to the death of a large number of fish and sea - birds .
this accident made the world sit up to the dangers of oil spills .
in 1969 , the santa barbara , california became the focal point due to the damage caused by the blow out of a well in the channel .
not only was the beach affected but even some birds and other creatures faced death due to the spread of oil .
when the oil hit the shore , about 1,00,000 birds died .
at times oil gets spread on the sea by the intentional discharge of oil ( as during the gulf war of 1991 ) .
the slicks stretched over an area of 100 km by 15 km and were half a metre thick at certain places .
such ' environmental terrorism ' can alter the ecology of the region in the future .
it was practised even in the ancient days .
the same strategy was adopted during the gulf war by releasirg oil into the sea unmindful of the damage done to the entire planet .
millions of sea birds were threatened by this oil slick .
to avoid harm caused by oil slicks , some of the following practices are adopted :
the oil slick is set on fire .
the oil is skimmed off from the surface with a suction 68 we breathe and drink poison device .
have you heard of mountains that are man - made ?
is it possible to produce such mountains ?
it is no wonder that every urban area has hillocks in each street .
these wastes are disposed from coal and mineral industries , mining industries , metal industries , engineering industries and thermal power stations .
another important solid waste which is noteworthy is biomedical waste .
this waste includes anatomical waste , syringes , gauze , absorbents , glass , etc .
the huge dumps of biomedical wastes disposed of by hospitals and clinics cause serious health problems .
why are solid wastes cause for such serious concern ?
this is a valuable manure of exceptional use in drylands as it conserves the moisture and releases plant nutrients gradually .
experiments are being conducted to obtain glucose and subsequently alcohol from the cellulose in the garbage .
the quantity of fly ash produced in thermal power stations is high and its disposal is a serious problem all over the world .
in india too , we have nuclear power plants though not on so large a scale as in the western nations .
a fire in the plant allowed massive amounts of radiation to be released into the atmosphere .
this fallout drifted into scandinavia and eastern europe , causing enormous damage to crops and livestock .
this however does not demean the advantages of nuclear power stations over others utilising conventional fuels such as coal and oil .
when compared to other sources of energy , the nuclear source is clean , compact and concentrated .
illegal felling of trees so as to mint money within a short span of time is leading to denudation of vast stretches of forests .
mining is also a major cause for such denudation of forests .
while we need ' mineral wealth , we have also to protect our rich forests .
unfortunately it took very long for the government to realise that clearing of forests for mining was putting the future generation under peril .
to cite an example , the maikal ranges in madhya pradesh have been mined for bauxite , leading to rapid denudation .
the fourth reason is conversion of forest areas into cultivable land .
apple and tea cultivation are prominent agricultural practices in the converted forest areas .
large tracts of the himalayan forests have been destroyed for the cultivation of apple .
the afforestation scheme will meet the increasing demand for fuel , fodder , etc . and simultaneously protect our environment .
further , people must plant more trees and save the existing ones .
